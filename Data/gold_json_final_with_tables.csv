displaying advanced academic knowledge in emi classrooms at a japanese universitymika ishinodoshisha university japanmishinomaildoshishaacjpabstract a conversation analysis was conducted on a particular practice initiated by students in emi classrooms a request to switch to l eg can i speak in japanese regardless of whether the students can talk about a certain topic in english or not by asking whether they can switch their language from english to japanese they place themselves as bilingual speakers who are careful when choosing between english and japanese based on the concerned topic by inviting the teacher to judge of their choice of language the students legitimize their switching when involved in the oral presentations that were part of the academic business in most such cases students choice of language was legitimized by the teachers acceptance that was displayed by assenting readily to their preference this study contributes to our understanding of how students in emi classrooms display their competence as bilingual performers to accomplish institutional businesskeywords conversation analysis emi classrooms switching to l   introductionto internationalize japanese universities mext  english as a medium of instruction emi is increasingly being introduced in the curricula of japanese universities compared to european countries where emi has a longer history japanese universities are developing their own emi programs in their institutions eg bradford  for example fujimotoadamson and adamson  described emi classrooms in japan as bilingual classrooms delivered in english but with japanese used for translanguaging garcia  wei  since many students share japanese as their first language lthis study will illustrate a particular practice that throws light on such participants interactional orientation in becoming bilingual speakers in japanese emi classrooms based on detailed observation of the practice i will make some pedagogical suggestions on the future emi classrooms in japan   context of the studythe data for this study were drawn from hours of video recordings of emi classrooms in a university in japan the emi classes were designed to introduce the process of conducting academic research among undergraduate students in the social science departments the course required the students to conduct their own research project either individually or with a peer toward the middle and the end of the course the students were required to make oral presentations reporting their work to the classthe analytic focus of this paper is the questionandanswer exchanges qa followed by oral presentations all the presentations and the qa were delivered in english excerpt  below shows a fragment of such qa exchanges frequently observed in the data this exchange began just after a presenter finished his presentationexcerpt  katsu s participants qquestioner p presenterq    thank you for your nice presentationq    i have a

questioner line  to  in excerpt  the questioner closed the sequence by producing a sequenceclosing third line although the students usually speak english during the qa as they are strongly encouraged to they sometimes switch from english l to japanese l such as for repair operations wei  milroy  or for word search sequences duran kurhila  sert    analysisa unique practice observed among the students was that when switching to l they initiated an insertion sequence by requesting the teacher whether they could switch from english to japanese eg can i speak in japanese this practice was observed in the middle of a qa sequence in  out of  cases of this practice the teacher immediately granted the students request except in one caseafter illustrating the two cases showing a typical and a deviant case of the practice i will discuss what the students intentions are in deploying this practice can i speak in japaneseexcerpt  below shows a typical request for switching to l prior to line

proffering a candidate word in japanese prior to ns completion of his turn this conditional entry of t can be characterized as anticipatory completion which showed ts special alignment with n lerner  after getting acceptance from t in line  n starts to ask a critical question on ms presentation in his reply from lines  through  m promises that he will add some statistical analysis to his final paperas shown in excerpts  and  the practice of request for switching to l comprises the following three features a it is generated by a minimal adjacency pair which is requestgrant sequence b acceptance is designed as a preferred secondpairpart spp of this sequence and c by deploying this practice the students change their participation framework since they invite the teacher to be party to their interaction in the middle of their twoparty exchange with their peerswe may infer from these students practice a situated competence of these students as bilingual speakers in the emi classroom whether the students are actually able to talk about a certain topic in english or not by asking whether they can switch from english to japanese they place themselves as bilingual speakers who are careful enough to choose between english and japanese in accordance with the topic they are discussing by inviting the teacher as a judge of their choice of language the students legitimize their switching at the moment of institutional business in most cases of this practice such students choice of language was legitimized by the teachers acceptance of the request which was conceded either in a very definite manner or with hesitance eg sure or anticipately completionhowever this practice holds a potential risk for students although the teachers acceptance was preferred as the spp of this sequence whether the students are able to switch to l or not depends on the teachers spp the following excerpt  shows a deviant case where the teacher did not accept the students request for

yh thank youas we can see in line  fuguta deployed the practice by requesting to be allowed to respond in japanese however unlike in the other  cases t did not show any sign of acceptance of the request as can be seen by the  seconds of silence in line  which was not considered acceptance by the students as seen by f and cs side sequence from line  to  ts silence in line  was treated as blocking as it disrupted the progressivity of the subsequent sequence although fuguda started answering inukis question in english from line  the progressivity of his turn of constructions was disrupted by several pauses and selfrepairs from line  he even started using japanese which led to many students laughter from lines  through  inuki ended up producing a sequence closing third in line  which comprised mainly smiling voices and laughter inukis response and the students laugher in lines   and  showed us that fugutas response to the question was improper and thereby laughable   discussionas illustrated in the excerpts the students in emi classes often face two types of interactional challenges one caused by their difficulty in understanding and explaining a certain topic in their second language and the other caused by their difficulty in understanding and explaining the meaning of the topic itself however by switching to l the students are able to reduce the first type of challenge for teachers such students request can be considered students strong orientation toward securing understanding of a certain academic topic this also showed students close engagement with the current academic activity of the emi classes thereby the teachers acceptance is designed as preferred spp in this practicestudents deployment of such a practice also helps teachers locate in advance the linguistic items that students need to be taught this is because the subsequent l turns would be exactly those linguistic items that students avoid delivering in l these items were treated as potential trouble sources for speaking or understanding in l therefore immediately after the students finished their l turns teaching them how to construct those linguistic items in english would be an effective pedagogy in terms of fostering students language learning in emi classroomsacknowledgmentsthis work was supported by jsps kakenhi grant number kreferencesbradford a  englishmedium

YGQIQ_2_The_Nishimura_Family_in_the_Kyoto_Kimono_Textile_Industry_Between_1900_and_1944_input.json,Conference Paper,5441,0, 95,5,4,Keiko Okamoto Hosei University Abstract Keywords,the nishimura family in the kyoto kimono textile industry between  and keiko okamotohosei universityabstractmuromachi merchants in kyoto have handled the kimono textile wholesale business for hundreds of years  the nishimura family is one of the longlived muromachi merchants that started their business in the midth century as hesh silk textile supplier for buddhist priests silk vestments and stayed in business in the st century  their longstanding family business was represented by a family crest that was dyed on a shop curtainafter the meiji restoration  environmental changes and technological developments brought an increasing number of consumers  this was followed by an influx of competition in the industry and the traditional shop style turned into a company in the early th century  during these years the old nishimura family led the industry while maintaining the traditional business styles that prioritized good relationships among shop owners workers and societyin this paper two nishimura family businesses chiji and chikichi in the first half of the th century are reviewed from stories privately written by their business successors and the kyoto chamber of commerce archiveskeywordsfamily business japanese textiles textile dyeing kimono kyoto japanintroductionthe japanese textile industry became one of the leading industries after japan reopened its ports to western countries in the midth century  japan became the main exporterimporter of fiber yarns and textiles however the business of kyoto textiles kyzome for the kimono has not been discussed much even though kyoto has been the center of highend silk textile dyeing  a possible reason for this is that kyoto textiles were valueadded dyed silk textiles for the kimono not silk yarns or woven textiles that were traded internationally to earn foreign currencies  kyoto textiles are in a secure niche in the japanese textile industry  these textiles were handled by muromachi merchants in the muromachi district in kyotoafter the meiji restoration  the kyoto textile business slowed down because of the new government policies the relocation of the emperor and his family to tokyo along with aristocrats and the abolishment of feudal domains and buddhism  as a result longlived muromachi merchants and kyoto city invested in the industry to revitalize yzen dyeing which was originally started in the th century  the industry has developed a massmanufacturing method for yzen dyeing using imported chemical dyes  these developments made kyoto the production and distribution center of massmanufactured kyoto textiles for the kimonoan increasing number of newly emerged uppermiddle class people who were not allowed to wear silk textiles during the feudal era gradually started enjoying these massmanufactured textiles  as the number of consumers increased more silk textiles were introduced into the market  thus it was born fashion and the kyoto textile business expanded into the sduring these years the nishimura family succeeded in courteously carrying their family businesses and three of them survived in the st centurythey were exposed to business competitions after the meiji restoration as more merchants came into the industry  they also confronted a sequence of difficulties when the economy experienced steep ups and downs  this paper focuses on the two nishimura family businesses chiji and chikichi during the first half of the th centuryby reviewing their businesses one could learn how preindustrial family businesses survived through the period of japanese modernizationmethodologyin order to contrast the nishimura family business with that of the feudal era previous research by adachi is reviewed first   then each of the family history is learned from selfpublished books by daijiro nishimura the th owner of one of the nishimura family shops and a retrospective manuscript written by an apprentice who worked for the other nishimura family shop between  and   facts on each family business and company profiles were collected from the kyoto commerce and industry yearbook in  and the directory of textile wholesalers in kyoto published in    the tax amounts paid by merchants were collected from the business and industrial directories of kyoto between  and    nakamuras previous research analyzed muromachi merchants businesses during the prewar period using the business and industrial divisions of kyoto    finally the significance of the nishimura family business between  and  is discussedthe nishimura family businessoriginthe nishimura family has been manufacturing flower vases called chikiridai figure  since the th century and offering donating one for adherents of kofukuji temple every year  they moved to kyoto as a palace carpenter at the time of the heian capital relocation   in the midth century when kyoto was on the nin war battlefield the family escaped to nishimura village in hmi shiga prefecture  nishimuras family name came from this villagefigure  chikiridai flower vasewhen the war was over the family returned to muromachi district in kyoto in  and started a business hesh that dealt with silk textiles for buddhist priests vestments  since then the muromachi district became the center of silk textile businesses and the merchants came to be called muromachi merchants  the first generation of the family business yozaemon nishimura decided to use the name of the flower vase chikiri as a trade name and used the design of the vase as a family crest  the house name was chikiriya chikiri shopnishimura family chikiriya expanded by the branch family system  most of the family dealt with silk textiles for buddhist priests vestments some dealt with silk textiles for noble people and others were a combination of textile and money exchange businesseach of the three nishimura families that survived in the st century succeeded in its unique first name szaemon jihei and kichiemon nishimura  the first character of the house name and the first character of the first name made the shop names chis chiji and chikichi respectivelyfigure  noren shop curtainbusiness operationthe family crest was dyed on a shop curtain noren to represent the family business as shown in figure    it was hung at the shop front during business hours  adachi describes that the connotation of a shop curtain came from the three main perceptions of merchants from the feudal era  trustworthiness  loyalties and  perseverancethe th chikichi owner remarks in  the trustworthiness cannot be established in one day but easily collapses in one day and he had always been pressured by himself not to ruin the sustained shop curtain  he also says that longlived chikichi family businesses were supported by good relationships among shop owners workers and society which are represented by the shop curtainaccording to adachi a family rule book signed by the two owners of chiji and chikichi no date mentions five articles regarding the shops decisionmakingthe shop operation should be determined in a family meetingthe new expansion of business should be discussed and decided in the meetingthe family is more important than an individualbranch families must respect the owners familyopening a new account was not permitted  if needed this should be discussed at the meetingfrom these articles adachi concludes that their management style was conservative and passive but it was the best way to keep the business running during the feudal era  in the early th century consultation among branch families managers and shop assistants became tighter than before for the sake of the continuation of the family business which resulted in limiting the owners activitiesthey also used the koh system which was originally a religious group of a temple formed for the sake of the flourishing of business  nine nishimura family members formed the gionkoh system in   they discussed and agreed on agendas such as sales dates prices interest rates and new businesses in order for the members to have equal opportunities and avoid competition  adachi summarizes that the gionkoh system played the role of a cartel for the family business   it made the nishimura family dominate the business through the th and early th centuries when establishing a new business was not easydaily businessthe employment systems of the two shops were similar to those of large shops in those days  about the age of ten a boy or girl starts working as an apprentice  in about ten years the boys apprentice has been promoted to a shop assistant and works for another ten years  the owner takes care of food clothing shelter and a small amount of allowance so that there is no payment  they are treated as family members and the basic idea of working is workandyouwillberewarded  not only do they expect to behave well but they also have to be loyal to the family businessafter  years of service the shop assistant is allowed to marry and become a commuter to the shop  the shop owner provides a shop curtain premises and household goods some shop assistants have a chance to be appointed as shop managers  in  chiji had  workers while chikichi had   when the owner permits a retired worker to have a branch business the owner provides a certain amount of capital  this support made workers loyal members of the family businessdaily business was handled by a shop manager sometime in the early th century  as important business decisions were made by the family meeting the shop owner fully relied on the manager regarding the daily business such as management of human resources strategic planning and supporting account holdersapprentices to participate in the business   however the owner as a successor to the family business took full responsibility for the business the authority of the owner was absolute and he was a symbol of the family business   this means that a shop owner was representative of the business in a society as well as a leader for workers  therefore when the family does not have a son adopting a son is necessaryafter the meiji restorationthe koh system and financial business that had been practiced by the nishimura family were terminated at the time of the meiji restoration  however family meetings the employment system and the manager business survived even after the accounting system was changed to commercial bookkeeping and the private and business accounts were separated into the th century   figure  shows a chronological table of the three shop owners from  to the th chis owner  was an adopted son and succeeded in the family business at the age of  when the industry was unstable  he made special efforts to revitalize kyoto textiles and exhibited artisanal textiles in expos held in western countries and japan  chis business steadily grew for over  years under his lead until chiji started dealing with yzen dyeing around the end of the edo period and became known for its highend yzen textiles by   the th chiji owner  was also an adopted son  in the s he was the president of two banks the vice president of another bank in  the chairman of the kyoto chamber of commerce and industry between  and  a member of the kyoto municipal assembly in  and a member of the house of representatives in   in  he visited the united states for market research with the chamber of commerce chairmen in major citiesfigure  chronological table of chikiriya ownerschikichi expanded its merchandise to nishijin textiles silk woven textiles from other production centers and white fabrics for yzen dyeing in addition to buddhist priests vestments in the late th century  the th chikichi owner  was adopted by the family in   he was the president of a bank around the turn of the th century  when he was about to become the president of the second bank the resignation of the previous president caused the bank to run in   with the help of chiji branch families and the bank of japan the th owner closed the bank without any debts to the depositors  he paid back all debts by the author sees that adopted sons in each of the three nishimura families conducted the family business well as they were more aware of the owners responsibilitieschiji   trustworthiness  loyalties  perseverancewhen the th chiji owner  died in  the th owner  succeeded the business at the age of   an apprentice tsutomu takenaka who started working at chiji osaka branch in  describes the shops daily life in a letter to his motherchiji shops are wholesalers who deal with kyoto textiles  i heard that the owner was a millionaire in kyoto  the branch offices were located in tokyo and osaka  the manager of the osaka branch is about  years old  the osaka branch business starts around  am because the manager who commutes from kyoto usually arrived at the shop late in the morning  neighbors start working at approximately  amthe shop owner had never visited the osaka branch  about  people work in the osaka branch all men  new apprentices were  and  from the last year  meals were provided and sometimes they were like feasts for special occasions in my hometown  the wakeup time is five thirty in summer and six thirty in winter  sweeping and cleaning in the shop is the first thing to do in the morning  in the evening bookkeeping for the day is the responsibility for apprentices  we have free time from  pm to  pm to do the laundry write letters and practice math with an abacus  however many apprentices go out for funapprentices do not have any money  if needed the shop provided us the shop provides everything apprentices need so that you do not have to worry about anything but one  the only thing that i need is the future set  i am now leasing the shops futurein this letter the number of employees increased from  in  to  in the osaka branch in   however the everyday life of apprentice has not changed much since the edo period mentioned in the previous section  as tsutomu says the th owner seldom visited the osaka branch so that the business was run by a managerduring his era chiji spent a huge amount of money helping customers and investments in those years  in  one of chijis main customers from the edo period daimaru went into a financial crisis  chiji and three other muromachi merchants helped them and become reorganization members  as a result  percent of chijis business comprised of daimaru business and a brother of the th owner became one of the board of directors of daimaru when they were incorporated into the daimaru department store in however when tsutomu promoted to a shop assistant at the daimaru department store in  he recalls chijis business with daimaru as followsthe shop manager does not visit the daimaru department store together with the account holder or me  competitors such as ichida account holders always accompanied elderly men who would greet senior managers in a purchasing divisionit can be assumed that the th owner heavily depended on family meetings as the manager visited kyoto main shop more often than to visit customersin the same year the brother of the th owner traveled to europe for market research and splurged merchandise without family permission  by the time the goods arrived in kobe port the following year the postwwi bubble economy burst chiji lost moneymoreover chiji ichibunn and four nishijin textile merchants established a woven textile company orimono shvgy kabushikigaisha with a capital of three million yen which doubled in the following year in    chiji invested in half of the new companys capital   it was the decision of the family meeting however tsutomu wondered why the shop spent a large amount of money on woven textiles when the shops main merchandise was kyoto textilesbecause of these expenditures chiji became almost bankrupt in   the family meeting decided to incorporate chiji and invested in another  yen  however the unchanging structure of the business manager business etc could not revitalize chijithe shop assistant tsutomu recalled that he later found that shop managers set selling prices with unfavorably low margins  three years after the incorporation the company again got in the red and the osaka branch moved to a downsized premise to save working capitalchiji  manager businessduring the th owners era chiji managers followed decisions of family meetings but the decisions were not made in a timely manner  the great kanto earthquake that occurred in eastern japan in  further damaged chiji   active muromachi merchants such as ichida gained a lot of profit by sending inventories to tokyo while chiji shop managers gathered at kyoto for meetings without any instructions chijis osaka branch lost its entire september business that yearmoreover chiji had been doing business with superb yzen factories full contracted and semicontacted that produced highquality yzen textiles however those skilled factories left chiji one by one to work for other merchants such as ichidain  chiji was in short of capital and transformed into a limited liability company with a capital of  yen  the tokyo and osaka branches were closed and only twentyseven employees were gathered in the newly rented kyoto head office  tsutomu recalls that on the first day of work workers expected an inauguration speech by the shop owner or a new manager about the vision of the business how to survive this critical situation or job responsibilities of the workers but it was one of the ordinary business days  by this time

started working in  and promoted to a shop assistant now became one of the investors of chiji volunteered to do a merchandising job while working as an account holder  he worked hard for the owners family and for the shop curtain as his mother told him that one would never serve two mastersduring this period the business was fully dependent on a persontoperson basis  for example one of the suppliers who doubted chijis ability to pay refused to deliver  thousand bolts of merchandise  however delivery was made possible only by the verbal agreement of a personal premise as collateral   tsutomu says that he did not have to sign a filingthe business became stable for several years  however when the government issued the second business integration act in  the th chiji owner  who was never involved in the business decided to close its business  tsutomu was the last person who agreed to shop closure  the business was closed in chikichi  manager businesscompared to chijis manager business style chikichis manager business worked ideally  when chikichi struggled with debt from the  bank run the two managers dedicated the business  sometimes they warned chikichis th owner not to indulge in hobbies  the longserved manager business worked more efficiently under the th owners period until the late schikichi  the authority of the ownerthe th chikichi owner learned two things from the bank run in  one is to stick to the family business and the other is to prioritize public welfare to ones own assets so that one will get more credits from the society than the fortune lost  the th chikichi owner recalls in  that this was exactly what the family rule book from the feudal era mentionedthe th owner finally paid off the debt in  but again in  another financial crisis hit them  at this time chikichi survived without bouncing checks  the business after this crisis was so severe that the family meeting set rules for surplus appropriation in  selectedthe financial loss of the previous year should be deducted from the future profitfortyfive percent of the annual profit will be used for the depreciation of the loss and five percent will be deposited for the depreciation of dead stock  the remainder will be carried over to the next yearexcess profit should be used for mortgage settlementafter this settlement the business became stable and in  the th owner  succeeded the owners position at the age of   the new owner was not very interested in the family business because the business crisis in  left middle school  since then he has devoted his research in social education and established a nannie school the research center of commerce and the association of kyoto historic site preservation  he lets old managers lead businessesthe th owner always proposed in the family meetings that he wanted to terminate the business  managers and his wife encouraged him to keep the business but the depression that started in  threatened the owner about the revival of the  and  crises   even though the shop did not suffer much from the depression the th owner decided to minimize the business focusing only on white fabrics of silk and artificial silk rayon for kyoto textiles  other divisions such as silk woven textiles and textiles for buddhist priests vestments were handed over to new branch families with capital  the business downsized but became stable and profitable after thatin  the number of workers at chikichi was about  and the estimated annual sales was  million yen  the shop was then incorporated in  with a capital of  yen  finally in  when the second business integration act was released the th owner decided to close the businessat the time of the closure the th owner sent account holders to every supplier and thanked them for their longterm business relationships  the owner thought that his son who was in the army at that time might have restarted the business sometime in the future  thus he asked suppliers for a possible future business relationship and provided a monetary gift for severance  the th owner passed away in  without meeting his sonthe th chikichi owner was thankful for his fathers way of closing the business when he reestablished the business in    prior to this the th owner left home in  for high school in nagoya went to a university in kobe and joined the army in   he returned to kyoto in    even after he reestablished the business he never succeeded in the familys first name kichiemon  according to the industry he said that he was not mature enough for the name   in his  book whatever happens to myself i can never ever terminate the family businessbusiness growth during the first half of the th centuryaccording to the directory of kyoto commerce and industries the number of listed merchants who dealt with kyoto textiles tripled in  compared to that in   while merchants who dealt with nonsilk textiles decreased  during this period kyoto became the representative of highend silk kimono textiles and at the same time one of the four main collectiondistribution centers of textilesfigure  shows the tax amount paid between  and  by the nishimura families and the four main muromachi merchants  the tax amounts paid by chis increased steadily while chiji and chikichi seemed struggled chijis tax amount increased until the early s but there was no payment in  and  when their business was in a critical situation  the chikichi business was relatively good until  when they downsized the business however the merchants association reports that there were about  members in  and even chiji which ranked  in  was still one of the big businessesfigure  tax amount paid by muromachi merchants between  and in comparison marubeni ichida yoshichu and ando whose establishment was during the late th century  had about  workers in the s  paid tax in  was between  and  yen which is almost the same as nishimura families but in  new merchants paid about  to  times as much as chiji and chikichi  it can be said that new merchants grew at a much faster speed  muromachi merchants business association recalls in  that the s was the best time for kyoto textile businessesunfortunately the sumptuary law issued in  prevented the industry from manufacturing and selling highquality silk textiles and in  the first business integration act reduced the number of muromachi merchants in the business association to  out of   again in  the second business integration act made all the muromachi merchants close or merge the business except for   since then silk business had been restricted until discussionafter the meiji restoration the nishimura family led the kyoto textile industry by supporting the development of kyoto textile dyeing technologies and promoting kyoto textiles overseas  the owners also had social positions around the turn of the th century  their daily businesses were run by managers and decisions were made in family meetings as in the previous eramoreover their business between  and  still adhered to the connotation of the shop curtain trustworthiness loyalties and perseverance  it was important for the shop to be trusted by suppliers customers and society   examples can be seen when chikichi owed all the debt from the bank run in  while chiji financially helped customers and family members  even at the time of the shop closure chikichi provided severance pay to their suppliers  they prioritized social wellness rather than business profitsindividuals such as shop owners managers and workers understood their social status well and worked for the shop and house  workers also worked hard for masters  all of them worked for the shop curtain  examples were seen in the working style of chijis apprentice tsutomu  he worked hard as an apprentice a shop assistant an account holder and as an investor over the years but he never complained about the shop the house the master or his status even though he argued a lot about managing style of the shop in his manuscriptworkers generally started working as apprentices and learned how to become good account holders on the job training basis  however it seemed that they did not have opportunities to learn how to be good managers   there were no articles regarding the management of the business in the family rules even in the added sections in the later period  what repeatedly mentioned in the rule book was that anyone involved in the business should not to ruin the shop curtain meaning the shop should not receive negative reputation in the societythe th chikichi owner daijiro nishimura wrote in his  book that a shop master must possess business management skills and the family business should turn into an enterprise when manager business was no longer practiced after wwii  however what he refers to is the importance of the trustworthiness fighting spirit and mutual understanding all of which he emphasizes were embedded in the shop curtain and management ability was deeply dependent on an individuals capabilities or willingnessthe author sees that it has been more important for the nishimura family how sincerely they faced the business rather than how they managed the business  they were always anxious about how society looked at them and how they should respond to them  the shop curtain noren and hung at the store front figure  was literally a face of the shop the owners and workers so that no one should disgrace itfigure  chijis shop front with a shop curtainbetween  and  two significant aspects of the nishimura family business were witnessed ownership management and branding   longterm ownership and the stability of the businesses can be seen in th chiji and th chikichi owners even though they served social positions  the family business had been in managers hands but worked well until the s   when the th chiji owner was less interested in the family business and relied on family meetings the manager business did not work properly as seen incidents in the late s and after  what was worse for chiji was that his successor was too young to succeed in the businesson the contrary chikichis manager business and family meetings worked well as seen in times when they appended the family rules and concentrated on white  the difference between the two shops was that the chikihi owner made decisions every now and then took responsibility for them  having said that neither of the manager businesses made them competitive in the industry where new merchants energetically expanded their businessesthe nishimura familys shop names and the shop curtain with family crests were already wellestablished brands and were enhanced when the family prioritized society over themselves  as a result they spent a huge amount of money and struggled with it until the s   when a business was operated by managers and decisions were made in a family meeting their actions were slow and the decisions may not have been the best one for the shop  in particular when the industry expanded and became competitive  it can be assumed that their business recovery toward the end of the s was largely due to the upward trend of the economyconclusioncompared to some of the rapidly growing new muromachi merchants in the s and the s the nishimura family businesses were relatively slow following their traditional business style  until  when their capital was sufficient the nishimura family had important rolls among muromachi merchants  however when the successors of the shops were less interested in the business and kept the oldfashioned manager business style their business became less competitive   in such a situation they could not adjust to the changing business environment or did not try to chase current business trends or fashion  they also carried out their conventional business styles  this was based on the nishimura familys traditional way of thinking that social wellness was more important than pursuing profitsin order to survive in the industry the nishimura family decided to make their businesses compact and concise   in other words they downsized the business and stuck to a line of merchandise known as chijis kyoto textiles and chikichis white fabrics for kyoto textiles  all these decisions were made by consensus under the connotation of the shop curtain noren which ran through their businesses until the wartime disruption and beyond   the shop curtain of this period was very important for the nishimura family in uniting society owners and workersboth the nishimura family and other newly established muromachi merchants practiced japanese family businesses but their performances resulted in different outcomes  future research is needed to compare businesses between the nishimura family and newly established shops    alternatively we can look from a different perspective  take all the muromachi merchants and manufacturersartisans in kyoto as a whole and focus on how they brought fashion into the kimono market in the first and second half of the th century  without muromachi merchants efforts massmanufactured artisanal kyoto textiles for the kimono would not have been developed manufactured or distributed throughout japanmany of the closed shops including chiji and chikichi reestablished the business and revived the industry in the second half of the th century
YUCB_37_20180828-proceeding_for_KAMES-_input.json,Conference Paper,1695,0, 26,0,2,Introduction Conclusion,reflection on arab media in the postuprising phase the whereabouts of media freedomyushi chibakomatsu universityintroductionthe purpose of this paper is to overview the situation of media freedom in the arab world since the arab uprisings began the uprisings ignited from a rural city in tunisia and then spread to other arab countries resulted in overthrowing longstanding authoritarian governments in tunisia egypt libya and yemen and have impacted on most arab countries although a series of protests started as requirements for better governance political freedom and qualified life its outcomes seem to be far from successful some countries such as libya yemen and syria plunged into civil wars with no end in sights and egypt even if it experienced ephemeral democratic period for few years after mubarak stepped down soon went back to authoritarianism until now except tunisia there are no arab countries that experienced substantial democratic progresses therefore contrary to the initial optimistic views on the uprisings which put its emphasis on peoples power and effectiveness of social movements toward authoritarian governments recent studies tend to take more severer perspectives on the incidents and shed lights on aspects such as robustness of authoritarianism its destructive impact on democratization in the region in the rung run and influences over interstate relationshipssoon after the citizens protests began many observers have paid their attention to media because many believed that it has played an important role in disseminating information among citizens mobilizing them and ousting dictators particularly those who emphasized the role of social networking services sns such as twitter and facebook called demonstrations in tunisia and egypt facebook revolution or web  revolution even before ousting dictators was yet to be done although there are much room for debate how and what extent media actually played in each countrys demonstrations nobody clearly deny the role of media in the uprisings for this reason many researchers have tried to reveal political roles of media throughout the uprisings however contrary to studies that focus on the role of media the number of studies that focus on the upheavals impact on media is quite limited while many observers regard the arab uprisings as one of historical momentums that showed the power of media freedom enabled by the development of media technologies most studies have never paid enough attention to the whereabouts of media freedom in the arab world after the uprisings for better understanding of the relationship between media and the uprisings this study considers the uprisings impact on media situations as well as the whereabouts of media freedom in the arab world since the beginning of the uprisingstrajectory of media freedom before and after the arab uprisingsto overview the situations of media freedom in the arab world since the uprisings began this paper starts the argument from referring the press freedom index pfi that freedom house usbased ngo that assesses each countrys degree of political freedom and civil rights has published from  taking the fact that number of similar indexes is quite limited freedom houses pfi is worth of referring in comparing the degree of media freedom among different countries the score of pfi varies from  to  countries that enjoy more degree of media freedom come close to  while the worst ones come close to  and every country is categorized into three types according to its degree of media freedom free f with score between  and  where media freedom is regarded to be guaranteed partly free pf with score between  where media freedom is not always free or partly allowed not free nf with score between  and  where media freedom is very limited and in crisis as we see in the below the situations of media freedom in most arab countries are categorized as either not free or partly freepfi transition in countries that experienced regime changes orand civil warsfirst pfi in countries that experienced regime changes orand civil wars are examined these countries include tunisia egypt libya yemen and syria as figure  shows although some countries such as tunisia and libya experienced dramatic improvements in score between  and  the midtolong term trend shows that except tunisia every country is still in the state of nf and the situation is getting worse this deterioration in scores seems to reflect the political and security problems those countries suffers in the midtolong term it is evident that the recent scores in egypt yemen and syria became worse than those derived before the uprisings most remarkable case is egypt in which pfi score just before the revolution is highest in timeline and as for libya the score is deteriorating rapidly and even if the score seems better than that of qaddafis period recent situation is far from ideal these facts show that except tunisia the uprisings did not improve the media freedom in those countries rather might have devastating effect on it in the midtolong termfigure  transition of pfi scores in countries that experienced regime changes orand civil warssource data from freedom house website httpsfreedomhouseorgpfi transition in the arabian gulf countriessecond pfi in countries located in the arabian gulf are examined as is well known except yemen countries that locates in the arabian gulf are monarchies and these countries are richer than other arab countries because of revenues from petroleum resources soon after tunisian government was topped down those countries tried its bests to conciliate citizens with several measures on one hand these governments spent a lot of money to distract citizens discontents to the governments on the other hand they took harsh measures toward those who rebelled against the governments while countries such as uae and qatar did not feel any threat within their borders bahrain experience a series of demonstrations that lead to the serious crash between citizens and army supported by saudi and uae considering the transition of pfi scores of those countries in the midtolong term it is noteworthy that the score in every country is worsening in the same manner as figure  shows not only bahrain but also countries such as uae and qatar regardless of the lack of any internal threat throughout the arab uprisings also shows decline in scores this fact shows the uprising did not become the momentum to improve the degree of media freedom in the arabian gulf countries but it might become the opportunity to promote the deterioration of media freedom in this area in the long runfigure  transition of pfi scores in countries located in the arabian gulfsource data from freedom house websitepfi in the other countriesthird pfi in the rest of the countries are examined these countries include jordan lebanon palestine iraq jordan sudan and algeria among them countries such as jordan and morocco experienced governmental change though the monarchy and the power of kings were preserved in both countries the governments tried to reconcile citizens and promised political reforms however when we think about the transition of pfi scores their scores did not improve rather become worse than before likewise taking other countries scores into consideration there are no countries that improved their scores dramatically rather the figure generally shows the decline in scoresfigure  pfi transition in the rest of the countriessource data from freedom house websitewhat is behind the deterioration of media freedom considering some possibilitiesjudging from freedom houses pfi except tunisia there are no arab countries that experienced substantial improvements in media freedom rather in the midtolong term the uprisings likely have had deteriorating impact on the media situation in most arab countries at least the situation of media freedom in the arab world since the uprisings began has never changed positively however why does this happen or what made the situation unchanged rather deteriorated in other words before and after the uprisings how do arab authoritarian governments keep controlling media here four reasons should be mentioned adaptability to new media environments restructuring of mediastate relationship strengthening pressures on media throughout political turmoil upgrading media policyadaptability to new media environmentsfirst contrary to the belief that authoritarian governments are not familiar with new technologies most arab governments have been getting more adaptive to new media environments since the early s most arab governments have tried to adopt themselves to stateofthearts media technologies not just ignoring them although the arab uprisings became an opportunity to show the difficulty of controlling media in the age of free flow of information the incidents also became the opportunity for most governments to learn the necessity of much more cunning media controlrestructuring of mediastate relationshipssecond some countries particularly those that experienced governmental changes experienced media restructuring after the uprisings therefore just after the revolutions there was hope for realizing better mediastate relationships however what most countries experienced was just the restructuring of mediastate relationships most media entrepreneurs who had good relationships with governments kept their business throughout the uprisings therefore the fundamental structure between media and state did not change dramaticallystrengthening pressures on media throughout political turmoilthird because the uprisings were strong political blow to both governments and regional orders many governments tightened social and political orders although countries such as uae and qatar did not experience domestic threat throughout the uprisings they are not irrelevant to the incidents to tighten social control government interfered domestic media leading to the deterioration of media freedomupgrading media policyforth after the arab uprisings many observers mentions that most countries have been upgrading technology for internet censorship as evegeny morozov mentions technologies can be strengthening authoritarian governments rather than benefiting citizensconclusionas this paper shows except tunisia media freedom in the arab countries does not show any improvement rather it tends to show deterioration in other words though the arab uprisings is kept in everybodys mind as the event to show the power of media the midtolong term trend may show that the incident was just the opportunity for arab authoritarian governments to upgrade their adaptability to new media environments

the covid pandemic this study found significant increases and decreases by crime type through quasipoisson regression analysis based on crime data aggregated by month and crime type for the period  in tokyo the study found a significant increase in fraud while many crime types decreased the study also noted that significant increases or decreases in crime tended to subside over time as the authors state while the crime situation during the covid pandemic has been reported in many cities there are few reports from tokyo therefore this study provided a valuable preliminary sourcehowever journal crime science is a criminology journal when considering this study as a criminology study there are many problems as discussed below theoretical contributionin this study since there is no systematic review in the field of criminology it is unclear what theoretical hypotheses were tested the results of this study only describe the increase or decrease in data and the theoretical viewpoints for interpreting the described results are not presented in other words because there is no interpretation from a theoretical perspective the theoretical contribution of this study is unclear the author should systematically review studies in the field of criminology propose a theoretical hypothesis that will be tested in this study and then interpret the results from a theoretical perspective the discussion section contains the results of this examination novelty of the resultsas the authors stated one of the values of this study is that it was reported using tokyo as a recent case study however much of what was revealed in this study was already reported by yamane et al  the author should review papers written in japanese including yamane et al  to demonstrate the novelty of this studyreferenceyamane m amemiya m ohyama t  shimada t  identifying the impact of peoples activities on crime  an empirical analysis focusing on the covid state of emergency declaration in japan  proceedings of the geographic information systems society of japan vol  description of the japanese contextin the discussion section of this study the results obtained from tokyo were compared with those of other foreign cities however the comparison is superficial because of the insufficient explanation of the crime situation and covid response in japan ignoring the difference in scale between the entire tokyo area and foreign cities studied in previous studies is also problematic crime in japan is not only less frequent than in other countries but also differs in the nature of offenders and locations where crimes occur in addition the spread of infectious diseases differs significantly between tokyo and other foreign cities the content of soe in japan is very different from that of stay at home orders overseas in the discussion section the author ignores such differences between tokyo or japan and other countries or cities and applies the results of previous studies conducted in other countries to japan without careful consideration therefore we should be careful in interpreting the results after fully sorting the differences between tokyo or japan and other countries in terms of crime characteristics pandemic trends and covid countermeasures the same applies to differences in scale the geographical and population size differences should be considered when making comparisons methodological validitythis study uses a curious methodology in the field of criminology a quasipoisson regression analysis based on the farrington algorithm although this methodology may be novel it does not sufficiently explain the problems with the existing methodologies that are solved using this methodology as in the studies cited by the authors orthodox time series and panel data analyses have usually been used in the field of criminology additionally negative binomial regression models are used more often than quasipoisson regression models therefore the authors need to explain the significance and novelty of the new analytical approach used in this study after proposing the problems of the analytical methodologies that have been used in the field of criminologythe explanation of the farrington algorithm itself is insufficient sufficient explanation is required to reproduce the analysis such as how the parameters for the model were set how seasonal variations were incorporated into the model and what kind of analytical environment such as r or stata was used practical contributionthe points mentioned in the conclusion section are generally too general japanese police are already taking measures based on the recognition described here based on the current recognition of the problem and efforts of the japanese police the author needs to explain the new practical contribution of this studysince this paper is a short report rather than a research paper the reviewer believes that the above five issues need to be fixed for this paper to be accepted as a research paper category of crime science journalhowever as mentioned in the introduction this paper has some value as a case report from tokyo the crime science journal has a paper category called short contributions this category welcomes breaking reports and case studies rather than theoretical novelty the reviewer is encouraged to resubmit this paper as a short contribution after organizing the content to place the value of this study on its rapidity and its being a tokyo case study rather than on its theoretical noveltythe following are minor commentsthe categories of crimes in japan listed in table  are not accurate in japan crimes are generally categorized into six types felonious offenses violent offenses larceny offences intellectual offenses moral offenses and others offenses the classifications shown in etable  are unique and illdefined for example in etable  fraud is included as part of intellectual offences but at the same time fraud also exists as an independent category as exclusive category from intellectual offences therefore it is desirable to organize the definitions of crimes and provide examples according to official crime classificationmore precise crime data written as the first limitation in the discussion section are readily available from the same data sources as in this study therefore the results of this study

KYUNG_34_1stReviewforJKMS-2022-0109-Ver2.5_input.json,Peer Reviewer Comments,782,0, 5,0,0,,comment to authoroverall impressionthe authors aimed to assess whether regional trauma centers rtcs are associated with truly better outcomes using propensity scorematched comparisons and to identify populations that would benefit from treatment in rtcs rather than in emergency medical centers ecs this issue has long been classically addressed in the fields of traumatology and emergency medicine and is hardly considered a novel topic however it can be an important study for the evaluation of the project for trauma system establishment based on the rtcs implementation in korea which started in  and is now  years old this could lay the foundation for the establishment of a national trauma systemthere are several issues that should be clarified from a scientific standpoint to increase the quality of work consequently the information presented is not new and the conclusions are difficult to support by the current study design and results although the subject addressed in this article is worthy of investigationspecific commentsaccording to the introduction and discussion section the authors considered the current project for the trauma system establishment in korea as an exclusive trauma system when working on this study there seems to be a misconception of trauma systems the rtcs implementation project in korea was initiated by benchmarking the who guidelines for trauma care who iatsic guideline for essential trauma care  and the example of the us regional trauma system establishment acscot resources for optimal care of the injured patient  etc these rtcs are positioned at the top of the inclusive trauma system and serve as leaders in the overall system that is the regional or national trauma systems however the authors confused readers by stipulating that the current situation of establishing rtcs in korea is part of the exclusive trauma system i think the authors should check the definition of an inclusive vs exclusive trauma system and make revisionsthe authors used propensity score matching psm to compare outcomes mortality between the two groups of patients with different characteristics however i think that the psm method was not applied properly so the study results are also less convincing in psm the factors showing significant differences between the two groups were matched as variables however the postpsm group still showed differences in almost all factors risk adjustment severity adjustment is essential for evaluating and comparing treatment outcomes of trauma care this study also tried to convert the characteristics of the two groups into a comparable group through psm methodology but severity adjustment was not appropriately performed although the difference was reduced after psm the two groups were compared without adequate severity adjustment if it is difficult to control all variables that show differences the authors need to adjust some variables through the refining process such as making groups appropriately before the psm application process for example by dividing the accident mechanism into too many variables matching becomes difficult and the statistical power decreases moreover the explanation of the process for making the psm model which can be the most important process in this study was not sufficient the authors were required to show the statistical values of the explanatory power and goodness of fit for the logistic regression modelwhen were the vital signs that the authors used in this study measured what is the missing data rate were the patients transferred from other hospitals included if patients are included it is difficult to determine the severity of the injury based on their vital signs generally patients are more severely affected and initial vital sign values are missing moreover the initial vital signs are not accurately measured in severely injured patients with hemodynamic instability these values are often initial checked for vital signs rather than real initial vital signs in this study it is difficult to follow the results differences in mortality based on a simple comparison of inhospital mortality between rtcs and ecs without clearly defining and appropriately correcting these points in emergency medical systems when patients with severe trauma die at an emergency medical institution it cannot be concluded that they died only because of the institutions performance in trauma care as noted in a recent systematic review and metaanalysis by the authors moore l et al impact of trauma system structure on injury outcomes a systematic review and metaanalysis world journal of surgery  many studies have evaluated the effectiveness of trauma systems but these studies have provided lowquality evidence due to the lack of adequately adjusting for referral bias for this reason in the process of constructing the trauma system it is recommended to conduct parallel multipanel reviews for trauma mortality cases even in developed countries and in who guidelines the authors are required to adjust for this referral bias selection bias appropriately revise and supplement

describes the objectives of the research that is carried out it starts by outlining the core idea and thus provides the main motivation for this research the subsequent section supports this motivation by giving a brief overview of current research and thus underlines the dynamics of this topic the objectives of this thesis are then described and the structure of the thesis is presentedmotivation and scope of thesisthe trend towards more sustainable technologies is driving the aviation industry to design new aircraft with improved energy efficiency the european aviation vision is an example of how ambitious environmental objectives for air transport have been set for the coming decades the flightpath  vision foresees that  emissions per passenger kilometer will be reduced by  and total  emissions by  compared to existing technologies in the year   as the environmental requirements for flying increase researchers want to develop aircraft with lower emissions therefore nextgeneration aircraft concepts feature improvements in several areas such as propulsion optimized aerodynamics or structures ref one trend in the research of new aircraft concepts is to increase aerodynamic performance by using wings with high aspect ratios as shown in schlichting these have the ability to reduce the induced drag of wings as a direct result of this the direct operating costs of aircraft can be lowered figure airbuszeroe and figure btruss show two examples of new aircraft concepts in which this trend towards more slender wings becomes evident the boeing x with a folding wing tip shown in figure bx is an example of the redesign of an existing configuration by folding out the wing tips the span can be increased to  structural design and aerodynamics are two closely related disciplines in the development of wings as the wings become more flexible with increasing aspect ratio further challenges arise small changes in the wing shape can have large effects on the aerodynamics this is particularly important in the case of swept wings due to the bendingtorsion coupling the wing bending caused by lift has a direct effect on the twist distribution of the wing ref one of the main features of this coupling effect is that with the wing deflection and the associated local change of angle of attack the span wise distribution of the lift can be shifted inwards this allows a passive internal load reduction under flight conditions with higher load factors such as those occurring during maneuver or gust encounterswith increasing wing flexibility more bendingtorsion coupling can be expected apart from the purely aerodynamic motivation to develop wings with higher aspect ratios and thus potentially less induced drag there is the additional motivation to use the natural kinematic coupling for passive load alleviationstate of research in the development of wing structuresnew airframe technologies as well as design and construction methods are making a substantial contribution to the development of new wings the massive use of composite materials has had a significant impact on airframe technologies in recent years as a result the use of composite materials has been increased to over  in the currently inservice b and a aircraft ref the high specific stiffness strength good fatigue behavior and the orthotropic material properties which can be used for tailoring the stiffness and strength in the direction of the main load paths make it an optimal material for lightweight structural design today the potential of composites is still not fully utilized hence the adaptation of the stiffness distribution by the ply angle and number of plies as well as fiber placement in complex paths known as towsteered composite ref are central topics in the development of wing structures another research area is structures with active functional integration such as morphing wings for example the work of fujiwara ref investigates how a continuous trailing edge flap with variable camber can be used on transport aircraft wings the smart droop nose of the german aerospace center is used as an example to investigate how continuous wings can be realized by a morphing leading edge the last area of new wing airframes deals with the design and development of higher aspect ratio wings as described in the previous partin the development of new structural technologies these days intensive work is being done with simulation tools this is also favored by the fact that computing capacity has advanced further since the first computers coming up in the s as a result computational methods such as the finite element method fem have been significantly developed so that it is today a standard method in the aerospace industry for describing structural mechanics problems in aerodynamics increasingly precise methods for describing complex flow processes have been developed over decades and the development continues to progress as can be seen at nasas cfd vision  refthe entire research field is driven by the motivation to minimize costs and risks through virtual simulations in addition more physical insight can be gained with appropriate methodologies with new design tools new technologies can be investigated that were previously not possible due to a lack of intuitive understanding or the fact that many tests on prototypes are financially inefficientin general load calculation plays a central role in the development of airframes as it influences the dimensioning of structural components basic approval regulations which accompany the development and certification process are specified in europe by the easa in the case of loads for civil transport aircraft the relevant regulation is specified in the cs section c ref depending on the requirements for accuracy the computing time and overall complexity of the problem to be investigated different models have been established in the development processin both structural mechanics and aerodynamics linearized computational models have become the standard simulation methods structures discretized by beam or shell elements under linear elastic and kinematic assumptions belong to this group for aerodynamic modeling liftingline methods or methods based on the linear potential theory such as vlm uvlm or dlm are often used however the inaccessibility of describing shocks or viscous effects is a disadvantage of the aerodynamic modeling used ref however they still show their advantage in the short computing time which is why they are used in many scientific research problems in the aircraft design process for example kier ref shows in his work how such models can be used to describe the dynamic behavior and structural loads on elastic aircraft including flight control klimmek ref shows an approach for the aircraft predesign load calculation and structural sizing and krueger ref and bordogna ref use the mentioned methods to investigate passive aeroelastic tailoring of composite wingsthe criticality of linearized methods for very flexible wing structures is reviewed in the work of palacios ref palacios uses the example of a high altitude long endurance hale configuration with highly flexible high aspect ratio wings to investigate how conventional methods cover the relevant effects the main focus is on structural mechanical modeling in particular on the description of geometric nonlinearities due to large deformations these have a considerable effect on structural mechanics modeling especially in dynamic gust load calculationsthe development of high aspect ratio wings for transport aircraft has been further advanced in recent years through projects such as nasas fixed wing ref or the cleansky smart fixedwing aircraft ref kenway ref for example coupled an eulercfd method with fem and optimized the nasa common research model regarding fuelburn and mtow using mdo tools depending on the objective function a higher wing aspect ratio is aimed at achieving a low fuel consumption configuration in the studies the total structural weight is increased compared to the initial configuration to sustain the higher wing loads to keep the additional loads low the aspect ratio is only slightly increased compared to the initial configuration when optimizing the takeoff weight in both cases it is shown that at higher maneuver loads the wing washout shifts the lift distribution further towards the wing root and thus a passive load reduction is possible in the case of the studied high aspect ratio configuration there is a larger reduction to be seen than in the stiffer mtow optimized configurationkennedy ref followed up on this work by using multicriteria optimization to conclude that the preferred wing aspect ratio for the requirement of minimum fuel consumption and takeoff mass is different in addition the influence of different materials for the wing primary structure such as aluminum cfrp and a hypothetical nano tube is investigated for aerodynamic analysis computational methods solving the reynoldsaverage navierstoke rans equations are used so that viscous effects such as separation can be taken into account the decrease in lift due to stall is identified in the optimization task as an effective measure of load reduction even though the use of such a condition is generally not feasible due to the risk of a loss of controllability in stall in order to consider such flow phenomena at all in the design calculation methods such as rans are essentialthe description of gust loads is largely carried out with linearized potential theory methods whose advantage is their fast computation times as presented in cook ref or szczyglowski ref their disadvantage however is the inaccessibility of important physical effects the potential of higher accuracy methods in the calculation of loads must therefore be further utilized in order to develop new more efficient technologies ref to consider transonic effects raveh ref compared different approaches to simulate the direct gust response of an aircraft a fully resolved rans cfd simulation and a hybrid method are compared by determining the impulse response sharp edge gust of a transport aircraft which can then be assembled into an arbitrary gust signal by convolution once the impulse response has been determined the method is distinguished by its short computing times raveh shows that a deviation of up to  occurs so that the approach is suitable for identifying critical load cases but the exact loads must then be recalculated with the much more sophisticated full resolution methods heinrich ref compares in his work a completely resolved rans gust response with a simplified method based on induced disturbance velocities this research was part of the aerogust project ref in the study it is demonstrated that for gust gradients larger than twice the mean aerodynamic chord  there is good agreement with full resolved simulations reimer ref applied the same approach successfully on a transport aircraft to compare the gust behavior with that of a potentialbased dlm gust model in particular distinct differences in the absolute load peaks could be identified both works have demonstrated that the described modeling concept represents the best compromise between accuracy and the simulation effort and is therefore suitable for detailed highly accurate aeroelastic design analysesaims and structure of the thesisthe work of kenway kennedy and brooks ref showed the advantages of higher aspect ratio wings for transport aircraft their natural passive load alleviation is demonstrated using a quasistatic maneuver load case furthermore a tradeoff is shown such that depending on the objective fuel consumption and structural weight reduction the wing aspect ratio can change significantlyin this thesis the general effect of wing flexibility on load reduction characteristics is investigated to gain a deeper understanding of increased wing flexibility wings with the same planform but increased flexibility are to be investigated as well as those that are inherently more flexible such as wings with increased aspect ratios in addition to steady maneuver flight transient loads due to gust exposure are considered in addition highfidelity methods are used to capture relevant physical phenomena according to their underlying theorythe starting point is the classification of the properties that influence the wing flexibility these can be roughly categorized into material and geometric aspects the influence of wing flexibility is then investigated by means of three demonstration problems the essential aspects of this work are shown in figure thesisaspectsa purely academic example is used to show the impact of the changing wing stiffness independently of the material stiffness or geometric aspects abstractly by discrete springs in order to study individual impacts which are often difficult to identify in complex realworld problems the academic model is reduced to the most basic characteristics the following example is a generic transport aircraft with different wing configurations the first configuration shows a wing aspect ratio of  with the same aircraft requirements and wing size a second configuration with a wing aspect ratio of  is presented for both configurations wings with varying stiffness are set up and their characteristics under maneuver and gust load are investigatedthe following chapter  will provide the necessary foundations on which the work is based as well as the computational framework that was developed to carry out these studies the development of the academic model and the numerical experiment and result analysis are described in chapter  in the following chapter  the generic fullscale transport aircraft configuration is described this includes the individual steps of the computational model development as well as design simulations such as structure sizing and jigshape design chapter  provides the numerical results from quasistationary maneuver loads followed by chapter  presenting the transient gust encounter results after underlining the relevance of the derived approaches and outlined ideas all the results and their scope are summarized in the final chapter quantitative assessment of passive gust load alleviationwithin the scope of this chapter an assessment of passive gust alleviation is carried out for that purpose a simplified academic model is presented to illustrate the main aeroelastic characteristics of an elastic swept wing for this a structural model with two degrees of freedom is set up the aerodynamic loading is obtained by solving the unsteady rans equation loads due to gusts are simulated with the fieldvelocityapproach as described in chapter fielvelocitymethod the model is then used to investigate the influence of the structural bending and torsional stiffness with respect to possible aerodynamic load reductionaeroelastic two degree of freedom modelto investigate the fundamental effects of passive gust load alleviation and its dependencies on the structural design an infinite wing crosssection  located at  of the semiwingspan  as shown in figure winggeom is considered it is assumed that the elastic axis is a straight line with the sweep angle  this is a model simplification since in general this is not the case for finite d wing structures as studied by ref the assumption is however reasonable as only a single wing segment is considered in this analysis the wing crosssection is based on nasas common research model crm airfoil the configuration in the structural coordinate system xy green of the dof model is shown in figure dofsection the basic concept of the following aeroelastic modelling approach is adapted from weisshaar the motion of the wing section is described by the two generalized coordinates  for plunge and  for the rotational motion it is assumed that the structure can be considered idealized by two discrete linear springs  and  which are located at the elastic

derived from lagranges equation in the discrete form given by equation motion  in this context the vector  stands for the structural displacement and the matrices matm matd and matk for the corresponding mass damping and stiffness matrix of the system the vectors ddotveku and dotveku represent the derivatives in time of veku the imposed external forces are described by the aerodynamic

global stiffness matrix matk can be expressed as followslabeleqglobalstiffnessby modelling as a beam element it has to be taken into account that due to the break down to a dof model  includes the stiffness against an applied force at the degree of freedom  later introduced lift force  and the applied load in  bending moment  this must be considered in the subsequent trim calculation where a constant lift is defined for the same lift but different aerodynamic pitch moment there will be different displacement results in the trim pointmass matrix assemblythe mass of the wing section is considered as a discrete structural mass represented by  and its inertia  as shown in  for the bar element the mass matrix with the degrees of freedom  is given bylabeleqbeammassthe element mass  is specified so that the translational mass of the degree of freedom  is equal to the point mass  thus  the offset distance from  to the shear center  is  and results in an additional inertia coupling

the two element mass matrices the global system mass matrix is obtained aslabeleqglobalmassthe two remaining mass parameters  and  with  are specified such that for a given stiffness the bending and torsional natural frequency meet specified reference valuesdamping matrix assemblystructural damping effects are modelled using the damping model after rayleigh the damping matrix matd is defined aslabeleqdampingmatrixfor the model considered in this study it is assumed that a constant modal damping applies for the  degree of freedom the rayleigh damping is formulated as a function of the damping ratio  and the rotation frequency  so that equation dampingmodal holdsconsidering plunge  and twist  as the relevant natural motions the two parameters  and  are obtained by solving the linear systemin the present case it is assumed that the damping ratios  thus the definition of  can be used where  stands for the logarithmic decrement computational aerodynamic model setupthe description of the flow and the calculation of the occurring aerodynamic forces  is made by solving the steady and unsteady rans equations the applied forces in the aerodynamic xz system are given by equation aeroforcexyz where  stands for the lift force and  for the pitch moment in reference to the shear centre bfeto consider effects caused by the wing sweep  the infinite swept wing theory according to busemann with a constant aerofoil section is used further it is assumed that the flow behaves frictionless in spanwise direction and thus boundary layer effects influenced by that are neglected the wing segment is thus characterised as a swept oblique wing with infinite span as described by busemann only the speed component perpendicular to the leading edge contributes to the lift ref a difference is therefore made between the profile parallel to the airflow and the profile normal to the leading edge of the wing which is mainly responsible for lift considering the velocity diagram of figure winggeom the effective normal wingsection velocity depends on the wing sweep  so that  it follows that the effective mach number  at the wing section isif the wing has a global aoa of  the relationship between free flow  and the vertical flow  applies to  considering equation redmach for the swept wing it follows that the effective aoa iscomputational domain and boundary conditionsthe flow around the wing normal crosssection is described by the rans equations which are solved by the finite volume based solver tau a cylindrical domain with a diameter of o approx cdot cref as shown in figure fluiddomain is used as computational domain which is discretized with an unstructured hex cell mesh the outer boundary is treated as farfield boundary condition and the aerofoil as viscose wall the flow is considered to be twodimensional therefore the space in  is discretized with a single cell and symmetry conditions are defined on both sides boundary layer effects are directly resolved by means of a sufficient discretization for this purpose the grid density at the wall is increased and the cell height lowered to achieve reasonable  values as turbulence model the equation model after spalartallmaras ref is being used in order to ensure independence from grid resolution a grid sensitivity study is carried out of which the results are described in the appendix dgridstudyfor this study two flow cases within the flight envelope are covered the first represents cruise condition at flight level  with a free stream mach number of  the second condition represents an aircraft approach with a free stream mach number of  at mean sea level the reduced free stream mach numbers are calculated according to equation redmach to take the dimensional sweep effect in the dimensional flow domain into account for cruise condition follows  and for the approach scenario  the pressure contour plot and the  distribution along the wing section for trimmed flight at cruise and approach are shown in figure cruisecondition and figure approachcondition respectively considering the cruise flight condition one can recognise that this case represents a transonic flow conditions in which subsonic and supersonic flows occurs including a compression shock a summary for the computational aerodynamic setup is given in tableaerofoilcfdsummaryaeroelastic model setupthe aerodynamic and structural models are combined to an aeroelastic model which is then solved in the time domain attention should be paid to the different coordinate systems in which the conservation equations of the structure and aerodynamic model are formulated the resulting displacements are transferred from the xz system to the aerodynamic xz coordinates by means of the coordinate transformation given bywhere  and  stands for the initial deformation in jigshape meaning the stressfree inital state in reference to the xz system since the rotation  is not represented in the aerodynamic model pure d analysis  the displacement vector of the wing section in the aerodynamic system isthe elastic twist  has the same effect on the aerodynamics as a local change in  therefore the elastic twist must be corrected according to the infinite swept wing theory as described in the previous chapter assuming  to be small smallangle approximation can be applied so that  and equation effaoa can be simplified tothe translational degree of freedom  remains unaffected however the influence of the elastic twist of the wing must be corrected by equation effaoasmall the effective displacement vector is then the superposition of the elastic deformation and the global aoa in case no external wind is considered the effective displacement vector can be expressed asaccordingly the aerodynamic forces must be transformed from the xz to the structural xz coordinate system the structural force vector is given in equation aeroforce with the three components lift force  bending moment  and torsional moment  the vector  is defined asto provide a better understanding of the entire aeroelastic model a schematic chart of the model is shown in figure schemeaeroelasticmodel along with the corresponding transformationsaircraft trim setupwithin this study a constant lift is assumed for cruise and approach if the flow condition changes this means that  in equation dispeff must be adjusted accordingly since the aeroelastic system as shown in figure schemeaeroelasticmodel has geometrical nonlinearities the static system is solved numerically by means of a minimisation problem of the forminterface coupling setupto deflect the wing crosssection in the cfd model the movement of the shear centre bfe must be transferred to the wetted nodes through a kinematic correlation the same applies for the inverse transfer from fluid to structural forces since the wing shape remains constant the resulting lift force and pitch moment can be transferred directly to the shear centre bfe by integration over the wing surface for the discrete model this leads to the summation as followedlabeleqfsiinterfaceforcethe displacement of the cfd grid nodes is calculated by the kinematic rigid body motion given by equation fsiinterfacekin here  stands for the reference coordinates at the beginning of the simulation at time  the coordinates  are the coordinates for the current configuration at

this purpose the initial reference configuration is defined by specifying the structural and geometric parameters that have not yet been defined after the analysis of the essential aeroelastic behaviour the effect of increasing and decreasing structural stiffness under static loading is subsequently investigatedaeroelastic response of the initial configurationto reduce the computational effort the  and  slope are calculated for the two flight conditions cruise and approach which are plotted in figure derivatives the support points are calculated at intervals of  and are stored in the aerodynamic model as a lookup table all further values for  are then interpolated linearly between the support pointsinitial configuration setupto specify the stiffness matrix and the kinematic

the length  to  which corresponds to a  half span position of the flight shape for the present investigations is fixed at a deflection of  and an effective aoa of  furthermore the stiffness of the jig shape displacement  and the torsional stiffness  of the structural model are preassigned the two remaining parameters bending stiffness  and the jig shape incidence  are determined in such a way that under aerodynamic loading the given boundary conditions are fulfilled a summary of the initial structural configuration is given in the following table strucinitsummaryaeroelastic analysisthe system response for cruise and approach flight condition for different global aoa is shown in figure initaeroelasticmodel here the blue graph represents the displacement  and the green graph the effective  in dependency of the global aoa since the lift is directly related to  the latter is used as an evaluation criterion in the following in addition to the elastic wing section that of a rigid is plotted in black as referencein the approach case the requirement for the same flight shape can no longer be satisfied as this inevitably leads to different structural stiffnesses and the corresponding configurations no longer have a common reference instead the same structural model from the cruise configuration is used for the approach configuration and a flight condition with same constant lift as in cruise flight is requested since the flight condition changes this is achieved by adjusting the global aoa figure initaeroelasticmodel shows the corresponding approach point with the corresponding global aoa of  for the initial configurationfor both cruise and approach it can be noted that the effective  gradient is lower than for the rigid case an increase in global  as for example caused by a vertical gust is therefore more reduced and thus resulting in a lower effective  in cruise flight however the gradient starts to increase at a global aoa of  and becomes worse compared to the rigidbody wing the reason for this is that the maximum lift  refer to figure derivatives for cruise is reached since the lift cannot be increased any further the bending of the wing is stopped and the corresponding washout resulting from the bending kinematic as well additionally as the global aoa continues to increase the pitch moment increases and reverses its effect this causes the wing to turn up further washin which explains the increased gradient of the effective dependency of bending and torsional wing stiffnessproceeding from the previous results the influence of the wing bending stiffness  and the torsional stiffness  on the deformation behavior is analyzed separately the starting point is the initial configuration in which the two stiffnesses are increased and reduced by  to see the influence of the individual dof the limiting case of infinite stiffness hence rigid is considered additionally to achieve the same flight shape in cruise flight the jigshape parameters  and  must be adjusted accordingly when the stiffness is changed furthermore different stiffness values necessarily result in different trim conditions which can be found in detail for all cases in appendix trimpointstorsional stiffness variationfigure aeroelasticmodelvartheta shows the result of the different torsional stiffnesses  with a constant bending stiffness  in cruise flight it shows that increased torsional stiffness offers more possibilities for load reduction since the slope of  is less steep consider that the wing twist is negative due to the negative pitch moment and thus causes a positive  in the jigshape the consequence of a decreasing pitching moment is that the wing returns to its jig shape in other words to a higher  with increasing torsional stiffness jig and flight shape converge more closely and the associated wing upturn is reduced the highest load reduction is accordingly achieved for infinite torsional stiffness meaning rigidity in rotation therefore the remaining load reduction at  is due to wing bending only as in the initial study upon reaching  the deflection stops at a global aoa of siapproxdeg  and the elastic wing section shows no difference from a rigid wingthe results for the approach case are shown in figure aeroelasticmodelvarthetaapproach the essential characteristics as identified for the cruise study is reflected in the approach study as well the most significant difference can be identified in the stall behaviour of the wing section during cruise flight the total lift remains approximately constant when  is reached whereas it drops at low airspeeds due to flow separation this is reflected in the structural displacement response of  as in the case of cruise flight the gradient in the effective  increases when the maximum deflection is reached thus also in approach flight the load reduction is loweredbending stiffness variationin figure aeroelasticmodelvarh the results of varying bending stiffness  and constant torsional stiffness  for cruise is shown the results show that the elastic wing section provides a higher load reduction at reduced bending stiffness this is consistent with equation dispeff since with a lower   increases accordingly and hence  decreases if  is assumed to be rigid the influence on  is considerably worse compared to the rigid wing segment as discussed in the torsional stiffness study this is due to the vanishing bending deformation and pitch moment preloading with a higher  the pitch moment is increased and the wing starts to twist back to its jigshape resulting in the same undesired washin effectthe same can be seen for the approach flight case as depicted in figure aeroelasticmodelvarhapproach it must be considered that the jig shape of the different configurations differs considerably from each other due to the change in bending stiffness this makes it difficult to compare them on the basis of a common design point generally the same behaviour can be observed that the more flexible wing section has the higher load reduction potential which in turn is considerably reduced when the maximum lift is reacheddirect comparisonto obtain a direct comparison between bending and torsional stiffness  in relation to aoa for the cruise case is compared in figure stiffcomp the initial configuration used as a reference is highlighted in yellow the case with rigid torsional stiffness shows the strongest influence on  closely followed by a wing with soft bending stiffnessdue to the linearity around the design point it is worthwhile to evaluate the load reduction potential in form of the gradient   thus describes the extent to which a change in the global aoa is reflected in the effective  whereby the effects of sweep and elastic deformation are both included the results of all configurations around the respective trim point for cruise and approach flight with variation of  and  are shown in figure gammacomp from the results it can be concluded that a moderately better reduction can be achieved for approach flight conditionthe influence of the simultaneous change of both stiffnesses  and  is shown in figure gammacompkthetaandh for the cruise case it should be noted that with increased bending stiffnesses a significant improvement can only be achieved by increasing the torsional stiffness this can be confirmed for the limit case of beeing rigid in bending by the asymptotes shown as a dashed lines with further increasing  the results of a rigid wing section is achieved around the reference position however even small changes in bending stiffness can lead to considerable load reductionssummary and discussion of the academic demonstration example resultswithin chapter  an academic example model to investigate the dominant influence mechanisms of passive load reduction of flexible swept wings was developed the structural model has been reduced to two system degrees of freedom which represent the bending and torsional stiffness of the wing the aerodynamic model was reduced under the assumption of a quasi d representation the interaction with gusts was investigated using the field velocity approachresults summaryin the first part the general influence of the two structural stiffnesses on the load reduction behaviour is investigated for this purpose the purely static behaviour meaning stationary aerodynamic forces without structural inertia was first considered in the second step the dynamic behaviour was then included by means of transient aerodynamic forces and structural inertia for this purpose different gust load cases with different halfwave lengths and design gust velocities are used in both cases it can be observed that the bending degree of freedom clearly dominates over the torsion degree of freedom a generally more flexible wing proves to be more efficient in the sense of load reduction since it can more effectively compensate the additionally induced aoa by the kinematic coupling for the case of torsional stiffness a wing that is as torsionally stiff as possible has proven to be an advantage this is primarily due to the fact that the centre of pressure is usually located in front of the elastic axis and in the case of a torsion soft wing the wing will turn up to ensure independence from the selected reference stiffness configuration a variation of the stiffness parameters was carried out the findings obtained could be confirmed independently of thisfollowing on two studies in the operational limit range were considered this includes flight at increased mean aerodynamic lift and gusts with increased design gust speeds in flight with increased aerodynamic loading the gust response shows a linear correlation with the increase in mean aerodynamic lift when reaching the steadystate  nonlinearities due to flow separation become noticeable in case of cruise the response behaviour can be divided into two categories lift collapse with quick recovery of the flow in which the lift required for a static flight is not falling below the stationary  and the second case where mean  drops and the airfoil no longer provides the necessary lift these phenomena could be demonstrated at least in the hypothetical  load case in the approach flight case however the influence of the flow detachment could only be identified at excessively high load in contrast to the cruise case stall flutter was identified as the limiting phenomenon in approach in summary this means that flow separation does not have to affect operability during cruise in the approach case on the other hand it ends in an unmanageable instability it must also be mentioned that compared to cruise a stationary flight must also take place at an unrealistically high mean in the last assessment it was investigated to what extent the gust interaction responds to different design gust speed and gust lengths in contrast to the previous analysis  is achieved through increased design gust velocity here it is confirmed that nonlinearity only occurs with cruise flight in the approach case no influence of flow separation could be identified even at extremely excessive design gust speeds in the same context it is also shown that the passive load reduction behaviour only reaches its full potential in the case of large gust lengthsfindings and discussionthe results obtained so far have been used in the sense of a simplified study with considering extreme conditions in the following the results are discussed in the context of engineering feasibility and among other research areasgeneral structural designthe first finding of having a torsionally stiff wing is first and foremost advantageous as this also has a positive effect against other aeroelastic problems such as flutter or aileron effectiveness the feasibility is usually limited by the fact that the corresponding stiffness is achieved at the expense of additional weight or new more expensive materials the lowered bending stiffness is mainly limited by dynamic aspects with a more flexible wing particularly short gust lengths tend to excite the structure to strong vibrations it is increasingly difficult to prevent that the structural vibrations start to interact with the rigid body motion of the aircraftwhat the investigations do not provide is the extent to which structural vibrations can be permitted active load reduction could ensure comfortable cruise flight under normal operating conditions in the event of failure of the active system however the passive load reduction behaviour is still available for the large gust lengths which makes certification and approval of new active systems correspondingly favourable depending on the effect on the aircraft as a whole system it is conceivable to allow vibrations in certain exceptional failure cases where only passenger comfort is affected but not overall safetyflow separationa further core idea is to investigate whether flow separation can be used specifically for passive dynamic load reduction a key criterion is whether the necessary lift for a stationary flight can be guaranteed a drop below this level is considered critical as shown in the investigations states with moderate flow separation can be identified in the cruise case which fulfil this condition it depends especially on how large  is between mean  and gust peak  if this is sufficiently ensured the flow has enough time to reattachespecially for approach conditions flow separation is technically difficult to achieve as a means of load reduction in order to reach the  range at all extreme flow conditions at high aoa must be achieved should from a design perspective such extreme boundary conditions be reached ultimately the instability of stall flutter must be controlledfor completeness it must be mentioned that the d model can show possible tendencies or limits but does not allow any conclusions to be stated about a finite d wing and its stall characteristic the collapse of lift in the d model cannot be compared that of an entire aircraft which of course cannot be tolerated it is to be expected that flow separation will not start on the entire wing therefore it must be discussed whether a partial flow separation can be tolerated which however the investigations presented in this chapter do not providemodelling reliability and limitsstructural coupling between bending and torsional deformation was intentionally not considered in this chapter the motivation for this is to keep the complexity of the structural and aeroelastic model as low as possible thus the effects of bending and torsional stiffness could be studied independently for wing structures this is generally not the case the coupling between bending and torsional deflection can be specifically induced by aeroelastic tailoring by means of the stacking sequence of composite materials however wing structures designed with isotropic materials such as aluminium also show such characteristics in this case one speaks of geometric anisotropy which is caused by different stringer arrangements ribs cut outs or different cross section geometries in summary the nonexistent coupling as demonstrated here is suitable for academic study but is not representative for complex finite d wing structures for completeness it has to be mentioned that the coupling could be represented in the academic example problem by assigning the entries  and  of equation globalstiffness accordinglya second simplification was made in the quasi two dimensional analysis of the flow in this case this was mainly motivated to improve the computational effort by simplification with known physical laws it was obvious and common knowledge that these reductions cannot represent the aerodynamic characteristics of a finite d wing therefore the subsequent chapters deal with the setup and the investigation of representative aircraft d wing modelssteady aircraft maneuver load studyin the following section the aircraft models described in the previous chapter acmodelling are utilised to analyse and investigate the load reduction behaviour under a quasisteady pullup maneuver as illustrated in figure introacmaneuver for this purpose different flight conditions are considered distinguishing between cruise and low speed in the first part the simulation results of the ar and ar wing layout configurations are given in detail therefore the aerodynamic properties  and lift distribution are evaluated at different load factors of the reference configurations in addition the wing root section forces of the different structural stiffnesses at different load factors are presented the results are finally compared and evaluated with regard to the potential of passive load alleviation under a quasisteady pullup maneuver loadsteady flight condition and computational setupin the presented analysis main influences of the elastic wings are investigated under the assumption of a quasisteady pullup maneuver flight the state can be considered quasisteady since the acceleration induced by the movement is constant for this purpose the aircraft is considered in a trimmed equilibrium flight state to achieve this all forces and moments acting on the aircraft must be in equilibrium including forces from lift control surfaces inertia and elastic deformationthe trim task is simplified in this study as the focus is on the lift generated by the wings a steadystate flight condition is assumed so that no transient effects are considered furthermore the aircraft is considered as a point mass so that as shown in figure maneuvertrim for a given load factor  applies the pitch moment of the aircraft is balanced by the structural boundary conditions and not balanced by the empennage for this study different load factors  are defined and the corresponding  for the necessary lift is determined iteratively until equilibrium is achieved influences of the pitch rate  are not taken into account therefore it is not differentiated whether the aoa is of steady origin or induced by the dynamic motion of the aircraft however due to the small distance to the centre of gravity the influence is small as discussed in appendix maneuverloadto consider the influence of different flow conditions takeoff cruise and approach flight is studied individually the individual flight scenarios are summarised in the following table aircraftflow conditionsummary in the subsequent analyses the final wing shape is initially unknown therefore an approach with a strong coupling scheme as described in chapter fsiframework is used to determine the equilibrium state between aerodynamic forces and structural deformationaeroelastic analysis of the ar wingsfigure arrefelasticeslope shows the load factor  and lift coefficient aoa slope of the elastic ref ar configuration for different flight and fuel loading conditions as defined in table aircraftflow conditionsummary the basic characteristics of the elastic wings are investigated in this context using the ref wing structure the corresponding  and slope results of the red and sft wing structures can be found in section clslopeelasticdifferences in the flight scenarios can be recognised in the different  and  gradients as well as in the characteristics at high aoa the influence of the fuel loading conditions is present however as can be seen from the  curves of  and  it proves to be small so that no major differences become apparent analysing the dependency of the load factors however similarities emerge for the same fuel loading condition the load cases with a full wing tank show a smaller aoa slope than with an empty wing tank so that a changing in aoa the load factor increases faster with empty wing tanksthe two empty wing tanks scenarios   are the only flight scenarios studied in which the limit load can be reached by a pullup maneuver the first signs of flow separation however can be seen at the end of the cruise scenario  this is even more apparent for the two scenarios with full wing tanks   only the approach scenario  shows no separations with a linear relationship between lift and aoa in the operational range for flight scenario  the lack of further increase in lift on the wing due to flow separation is illustrated in figure arflowserperationcruise shown is the surface friction coefficient  as contour plot of the upper wing surface it can be noted that with increasing load factors  flow separation occurs which is indicated by areas with a low or negative  coefficientexternal wing loads investigation of the reference configurationanalysing integral values such as  can only give a limited indication of the loads that occur as in particular the influence of the lift distribution is not included therefore the resulting aerodynamic section loads transverse force  bending moment  and torsional moment  at the wing root reference point are used as evaluation criteria for the different flight scenarios  those are shown separately with changing load factors in figure arcruiserootforcesreference for all cases a linear behaviour is observed around the steady flight state at  the effect of the already identified flow separation on the wing root section forces at higher load factors can be seen by the vanishing gradient or dropping of the external loadsin order to better understand the effects that causes the change in the root bending moment  and the torsional moment  the lift distribution and wing deformation is analysed at different load factors in more detail the results for the different flight and fuel loading conditions are illustrated for cruise speed in figure arcruise and for low speed in figure arapproach respectivelyfrom the results a number of correlations can be identified that describe the essential characteristicsthe lift distribution illustrated in figure arcruisemodel shows the respective load centre of the lift force at different  as a dashed line in both cruise scenarios it can be noted that for higher load factors  the lift shifts towards the wing rootwhen increasing the load factor  the gradient in bending  and torsional moment  decreases at a certain value the reason for this can be found in the lift distribution plot between  and  for fuel model or respectively between  and  for fuel model first flow detachments are visible which can also be seen in the  value given in figure arflowserperationcruiseit can also be observed that the lift increase at the wing root is proportionally higher due to the larger aoa by shifting the lift towards the wing root the moments increase proportionately lessat the same time the deflection  and twist  on the wing is reduced and the washout stopswith a further increase in the load factor a considerable reduction in lift due to flow separation can be observedwith reduced lift the deflection decreases and the wing begins to twist up meaning the local aoa is increased this means that the load reduction effect stops and the moment continues to increasethe low speed lift distribution for takeoff and approach scenario is shown in figure arapproach similar fundamental principles can be identified from the resultsat higher load factors  the lift shifts towards the wing rootwith full wing tanks it appears that flow separation occurs at higher load factorsfrom a semispan of  it can be noted that due to the washout the flow is attached againas the load factor increases the airflow over the entire wing starts to separate over a large sectionthe loss of lift reduces the deflection and stops the washoutthe flight scenario at low speed with empty wing tank figure arapproachmodel is important as it represents a pullup maneuver study where enough lift can be generated so that the maximum load factor can be reached in this case it can be identified from the load application lines shown as dashed lines that they only shift slightly in the direction of the wing root this implies that the load reduction by washout has only a minor effect the load even if possible is not increased further at this point since the limit load  as defined in the sizing scenario is reachedexternal load comparison at different wing stiffnessesin the following the influence of modified structural stiffness on the lift distribution and thus the wing washout with the possibility of load reduction is investigated this will be done by comparing the wing root section loading of the three different flexible wings ref red and sft under consideration of the different flight scenarios in particular the load reduction at increased maneuver load factors is the primary interest of the study therefore the difference between   and  is presented more details about the absolute values can be found in annex externalloadresultcruise flight scenariosthe variation of the section root forces compared to the ref stiffness configuration at cruise flight with mass model  is depicted in figure arcruiserootforcesmodel comparing the transverse root sectional load  between the individual stiffness variants ref red sft it is found that there are only minimal changes this is due to the maneuver flight which requires a trimmed flight condition with the same total aircraft  although only to a small magnitude the more flexible wing configurations red sct has a lower wing  which can be attributed to the stronger washout since the required lift must per definition remain constant the loss of lift has to be compensated by an additional higher aoa this means by implication that the fuselage also experiences an increase in lift the differences in  thus describe the shift in lift between the wing and the fuselage at higher load factors as a consequence transverse load reduction in maneuver flight can only be achieved by redistributing the lift between wing and fuselagea more relevant result is the change in bending and torsional moments  and  unlike lift both quantities are independent of the maneuver trim state and are ideally not increased or maintained low in the sense of a maneuver load reduction as illustrated in the  and  results these quantities show a load reduction capability with an increasing load factor in general it can be noted that with more wing flexibility the load reduction margin in maneuver flight can be furthermore reduced however all configurations indicate a peak after which the load cannot be reduced any further this is followed by a decrease in the reduction and a transition to an unsteady wing flow this also corresponds to the starting of flow separation indicated by the oscillatory response of the external aerodynamic loads further the wings bending deflection can no longer be increased due to lift drop the peak points thus mark the potential from a steadystate evaluation by how much the loads can be reduced these are summarised in table arapproachrootloadsummaryb results beyond this point are not taken into account in the evaluation as these flow conditions have a high unsteady nature for which the modelling assumptions of a quasisteady flow reach its limitationsthe results for cruise with full wing tanks  shows only marginal improvements with varying wing stiffness due to the flight at maximum takeoff weight the steady cruise  at  is already high and leaves only minimal possibility to increase the lift further the correlation between wing deflection and washout identified in chapter kap can also be observed between  scenario and empty wing fuel tank scenario  as a result of the lower total weight the stationary  at cruise  is lower as well consequently the necessary lift for higher  maneuvers can be achieved before flow separation occurs on the wing the relative deflections  and wing twist  are therefore larger see figure arcruisemodel and figure arcruisemodel and with the increased washout more maneuver load reduction can be achievedfor completeness it must be taken into account that for load factors smaller than  the load is increased due to a reversed kinematics this means that the positive impact during positive load factors causes a higher load with more flexible configurations as the load factors continue to more negative values the linear range stops and a transient flow with negative stall occurslow speed flight scenariosfigure arapproachrootforces shows the wing root section forces at low speed flight in the takeoff scenario  with full wing tanks it can be seen that as in cruise flight the maximum loading factor cannot be achieved due to flow separation and resulting loss of lift in the approach flight scenario  however no stall or other nonlinear dominating phenomena could be identified within the maneuver load envelope consequently there is a linear correlation between the load factor and the three wing root section forces in the entire maneuver load  range the maximum load reduction for  and  compared to the ref wing stiffness are summarised in table  arapproachrootloadsummaryb an improved external load reduction characteristic is noticeable in both scenarios with a more flexible wing as wellaeroelastic analysis of the ar wingsin the following the ar wing configuration is subjected to the same analysis and assessment as the ar wing in the previous chapter the four flight scenarios described in table aircraftflow conditionsummary are used as the basis for the load analysis figure arrefelasticeslope shows the aoa and aoa slope of the elastic ref ar configuration with full fuel tanks   the maximum maneuver load will not be exceeded due to flow separation and related limited lift only the flight scenarios with an empty wing tank show the possibility to reach the maximum maneuver load factor whereby scenario  again has a linear aoa characteristic over the defined range the slope results for red and sft can be found in clslopeelasticthe drop in lift is in the ar configuration as in the ar study related to the beginning flow separation on the wing to illustrate this the surface friction coefficient  is shown in figure arflowserperationcruise where low negative  values show areas of a detached flowexternal wing loads investigation of the reference configurationthe resulting aerodynamic wing root section loads   and  at the wing root reference point for the ref stiffness configuration at different load factors are shown figure arcruiserootforcesreference note that due to the larger wingspan the bending and torsional moments at the wing root are generally higher compared to the ar wing similarly the steady flight point at  is in the linear range and the influence of stall can be recognised by the decreasing slope of the section forces with increasing the lift distribution along the span is illustrated for selected load factors at cruise speed in figure arcruise and at low speed in figure arapproach respectively for this case study it can be statedwith increasing load factors the load application centre shifts towards the root of the wingcompared to the ar configuration a significantly larger deflection and particularly increased wing twist can be observedthe cruise load cased show a reduced in lift due to flow separationfor flight case  an up twist of the wing can be observed especially in areas of flow separationa particular difference can be observed at low speed fuel model shown in figure arapproachmodel the important characteristics arecomparing the position of the flow separation to the cruise flight scenario shown in figure arcruisemodel it is noticeable that the position of the separated flow in approach shifts towards the fuselagethe wing twisting is considerably more negative so that the increased aoa necessary for a higher manoeuvre load factor is partially compensated as a consequence the local wing aoa is lower so that the flow is restored in the outer part of the wing and does not detach as the wing increases in stiffness towards the wing root this effect is progressively reduced why it comes to flow separation point the point of lift force indicated as dashed lines hardly changes its position in the low speed cases the same could be observed in the ar configurationexternal load comparison at different wing stiffnessesin the following the influence of varying structural wing stiffness ref red and sft on the lift distribution and wing washout is studied this is once more demonstrated by comparing the wing root section loading in different flight scenarioscruise flight scenariothe section root forces for different wing stiffnesses at cruise flight is depicted in figure arcruiserootforces as in the previous ar wing study the stiffness configuration between red and sct with respect to ref is illustrated further details are provided in annex externalloadresult essentially the same phenomena as for the ar wing can be identified for the transverse wing load  a lift shift to the fuselage for higher  can be observed as well as a linear dependency close to the steadystate cruisecondition which is stopped by reaching  and the subsequent flow separation a general difference compared to the ar configuration can be observed in the relative load reduction which is larger in the case of the ar wing in the  flight scenario a lower steady  at  in turn leads to more wing bending deflection before stall occurs the section force peak load for evaluation of the load reduction characteristic is specified after reaching the end of the linear range with the results summarized in table arrootloadsummarylow speed flight scenariofigure arapproachrootforces shows the wing root section forces at low speed flight scenario  and  in general a more flexible wing configuration shows the best potential to reduce loads at higher load factors the results for the low speed approach  show that as with the ar wing no flow separation or other nonlinear dominant phenomena can be identified within the manoeuvre load range also in this case the structurally more flexible wing configurations show a better load reduction characteristic which increases up to  and has not reached a local optimumsummary and discussion of the steady maneuver load resultsfrom the quasisteady maneuver loading study it can be concluded that both wing layouts have similar characteristics in terms of load reduction due to more flexible wing structures the main common aspects arethe ability to reduce the load compared to a steady  flight depends substantially on how much the wing can deflect therefore a higher load reduction can be achieved with a more flexible wing structurethe maximum deflection depends on how much lift the wing can provide and thus how much is required for a given maneuver flight a limiting factor is therefore stall when flow separation occurs the load reduction characteristic starts to decrease followed by fluctuations caused by the unsteady flowdue to the wing washout more flexible wings show that the lift is shifted towards the wing root with a small amount distributed to the fuselagethe limit load for pullup maneuver can only be achieved in the low speed scenario with empty fuel tank however the largest external loads occur at low speed and mtowin order to better illustrate the differences between the wing layouts in terms of load reduction performance the main results are summarised in table summaryloadreduction the assessment is done by evaluating the wing root section forces at the steady flight point at  for the ar and ar wing layout the absolute values of the bending moment  and the torsional moment  as well as their gradient with regards to a change in  is listed the results show that the ar wing has higher external wing loads in all configurations and scenarios investigated due to the increased wing span this is to be expected and therefore the root load gradient is evaluated as a second criterion the change in the wing root loading shows that for all analysed conditions the ar wing shows lower increase per  this means that the ar wing not only has a generally higher internal load but also additional induced maneuver loads are considerably higher even though the ar is due to its geometrical layout structurally more flexible than the ar wing no improved load reductions can be identifiedthe statements outlined above only apply around the stationary point of flight however since the aircraft structure is designed for maximum loads no final assessment based on the maximum load can be provided based on the listed data as shown in the previous chapters except for scenario  high loading conditions are accompanied by flow separation phenomena in order to be able to determine the maximum load it must first be clarified whether flow separation can be tolerated in general or to which extent this raises the following key questionsaircraft meneuvriability due to the quasisteady simulation a steady flow state is achieved at moderate load factors where low or even neglectable instationary effects can be assumed however in order to reach this quasisteady flow state a transient maneuver flight is necessary it is therefore questionable whether control and flight stability can be maintained at all with the beginning detached flow this includes the consideration of whether control surfaces are still effective or able to generate forces to control the aircraftaerodynamic pitchup is an undesirable characteristic of swept wings at high aoa due to the shift in lift relative to the centre of gravity the nose of the aircraft may pitch up unintentionally this is especially critical when flow separation occurs as the lift changes abruptly and the changed pitching moment must be adjusted accordinglyfor civilian passenger aircraft the mentioned aspects are considered problematic in terms of developing a reliable aircraft it is therefore difficult to define a common basis of definition that enables all configurations to be compared and assessed on a common basis taking into account that both wings provide the same total lift the ar configurations show a better potential to reduce loads in terms of absolute loads this is due to the fact that the wing span is smaller and thus the sectional wing root moments are considerably lowerthe general positive effect that more flexible wings have a better load reduction potential can be seen in the gradient of the internal load differences  and  table summaryelasticloadreduction shows the changes in root bending moment in reference to steadystate flight  all configurations show that the load can be better reduced with increasing flexibility this turns out to be better for the ar configuration in the critical flight scenario  where the highest external load occurs this can only be exceeded by the ar wing for  flight scenario with the sft flexible wingit can be summarised that the more flexible ar wing can better utilize the kinematic washout effect to reduce the load however this is not enough to compensate the higher load level resulting from the larger wingspan compared to the ar wingaircraft gust load studyin the following section the aeroelastic aircraft models introduced in chapter acmodelling are used to study the load reduction characteristics under dynamic gust interaction as illustrated in figure introacgust the influence of gusts is investigated using the fieldvelocityapproach as introduced in the academic demonstration example chapter kap the gust model and the setup required for the transient simulation are introduced first in the following study a gust with a short gust gradient and a gust with a long gust gradient are considered in which a distinction is made between cruise and approach flight scenarios under the influence of different gust lengths the ar and ar wing designs including different stiffness configurations are analysed individually and the results obtained are presented in conclusion the two configurations are compared and a characterisation of the gust response is made with regard to external load reductionflight condition and computational setupas computational models the structural and aerodynamic models developed in chapter acmodelling are used the simulation setup is therefore the same as in the maneuver load study with the only difference that the pitch angle  is used for trimming and not the global aoa since no external wind is taken into account it applies that  as initial solution of the transient simulations the results of the trimmed steadystate calculation at  is used at time  the position of the gust is  in front of the aircraft wing reference point the physical time step size used for the transient simulation is  the choice of the time discretisation step is a compromise between accuracy and computational runtime for the transient gust load analysis the two flight scenarios cruise at  with fuel model  and approach  with fuel model  is considered these two cases are further separated into a gust load case with a short and a gust load case case with a long gust length the corresponding flow and gust parameters are listed in table table acgustcases the geometric proportions of gust length and aircraft size here the ar wing configuration with  cruise flight scenario are plotted in figure acgustmodels the previously introduced field velocity approach is used to model the induced gust speedsaeroelastic gust load response of the ar wingsin the following section the influence of the wing flexibility on the load reduction characteristics under external aerodynamic gust load is studied therefore the structural ar wing models developed in chapter acmodelling are investigated on their characteristics under a transient cos gust encounter the gust loads are obtained by means of a transient fluid structure interactions simulation the loading scenarios are distinguished in a cruise and approach flight scenario as described in table acgustcasesresults for cruise flight conditionthe  time progression results for gusts with different structural stiffness ref red sft are given in figure clcruise the additional induced lift caused by the gust can be detected in the  graph which then causes the wing structure to deflect and oscillate around the steady state flight condition the longer gust exposure and higher gust vertical velocity of the case scenario results in a considerably higher induced maximum the respective deformation of the wing tip over time for the different stiffnesses relative to the undisturbed steadystate flight condition of the gust case and case scenarios are shown in figure cruisegustwingtipdeformation additionally the deflection  and twist  along the span is illustrated in figure cruisegustdeformationref with the undisturbed steady state condition at  indicated in black the elastic deformation of the case gust is shown in green with the minimum and maximum values indicated as solid lines the results of the case gusts scenario are depicted in blue respectively the higher induced  at case results in all cases in more wing deflection this is also more significant with increasing structural flexibility in case the key difference is that the amount of  increases with increasing flexibility this means that there is more washout and thus more reduction of the local aoaexternal load resultsdue to the wing sweep the maximum peak load of the root bending moment  and the torsion moment  do not occur at the same time therefore both are plotted in a bendingtorsion diagram as shown in figure casecruiseload and figure casecruiseload the initial state at  is given by markers with the transient evolution along the hystereses indicated by the arrowfor case it can be noted that the more flexible wing leads to an increased external load comparing the results with the deformation plot in figure cruisegustdeformationref it is noticeable that the reduction of the local aoa is not sufficiently strong to reduce the additionally induced aoa by the gust upwind in addition the extra lift causes the wing to twist up this effect was observed in the academic model as well which demonstrated that in the absence of wing bending due to inertia the wing twists up leading to a local aoa increase the reason for this is the position of the neutral point which lies in front of the elastic axis as the torsional stiffness counteracts the up twist this becomes more pronounced with reduction of the torsional stiffness of the wing the load reduction behaviour for small gust lengths is thus affected negative by a more flexible structural wing this is in contrast to the steady state results conducted in the previous maneuver load study in chapter maneuverload and means further that the gust interaction time has an effect on the load reduction characteristic this was also observed and described in the academic model of chapter kapthe evaluation of the case bendingtorsion load in figure casecruiseload shows that the peak load of all three stiffnesses is close to each other the reason for this can be found in the  curve in figure casecruisecl and the steady elastic  slope determined in figure arrefelasticeclslope with  the first nonlinearities due to flow separation can be noted and as in the steady state analysis the load reduction depends on the wings deflection if this is limited by the stall boundary the washout of the wing also comes to a stop in order to investigate the drop in lift due to flow separation the lift distribution during the gust encounter of scenario case is analysed in more detailthe lift distribution for different time steps is shown in figure arcruiseliftdistribution the undisturbed steady distribution at  is plotted in blue at time  displayed in green the maximum bending moment is reached the maximum  is reached at  cyan whereby the first reductions in lift due to flow separation can be identified when the maximum deflection is reached at  yellow the decrease in outboard lift is clearly advancedthe flow separation occurring on the wing can also be quantified via the surface friction coefficient  between  shown in figure arcruiseflowseperationa and the maximum wing tip deflection plotted in figure arcruiseflowseperationb in addition for the structural configurations red and sft the surface friction  at maximum deflection are shown in figure arcruiseflowseperationc and figure arcruiseflowseperationd respectively in comparison it can be found that the separation is slightly washed out when the wing becomes more flexible but it is not completely prevented the time of maximum deflection is also considerably delayed this explains why the maximum bending moment  does not differ much in cruise gust case as it is dominated and limited by the flow separationresults for approach flight conditionin figure clapproach the  results for gust case and case at approach flight condition are presented a significant difference is observed in the gust scenario case in which the maximum induced  is significantly lower for a structurally more flexible wing further it can be noticed that the oscillation is more dampened due to the higher air densitythe results of the wing tip deflection  relative to the undisturbed flight shape during approach flight condition are shown in figure approachgustwingtipdeformation compared to the cruise scenario the wing deflects noticeably more during the approach flight the reason for this is the lower fuel mass of the wing so that the inertia forces acting against the lift is lower in addition no lift limiting effect like flow separation occurs when comparing the twists  in gust case in relation to the undisturbed flight shape it can be observed that the wing achieves more washout in the approach flight in gust case a larger amplitude is observed as well with the difference that the wing twists up as in cruise flightthe deflection  and  along the normalized wing span  is shown in figure approachgustdeformationref with the undisturbed steady state flight shape at  indicated as black line the elastic deformation of the case gust is shown in green and the case scenario in blue respectively the generally increasing deflection with increasing structural flexibility can also be identified in this plotexternal load resultsthe analysis of the external loads in approach case plotted in figure caseapproachload shows that the peak level loading is lower as for the cruise case the structurally more flexible wing configurations are not able to provide beneficial alleviation of the additional induced loads at small gust lengths taking into account the deformation analysis in which the wing twists up at small gust lengths it becomes apparent that the loads cannot be reduced since the absolute twist up  is larger compared to cruise higher load amplitudes are induced as wellfor gust load case depicted in figure caseapproachload it can be illustrated that with increasing structural flexibility the maximum wing root gust loads  and  can be reduced the absolute external loads values are lower than the cruise case but the peak load amplitude can be reduced significantly this could also be observed in the stationary maneuver load study where in the approach scenario no stall occurs on the wing due to the progressive increase in lift the wing can consistently progress the washout and effectively reduce the loadaeroelastic gust load response of the ar wingsin this section the load reduction of the ar wing layout with different structural stiffnesses encountering the gust lengths case and case is investigated as for the ar wing the results are presented for a cruise  and approach  flight scenario from table acgustcasesresults for cruise flight conditionthe time progression of  for the three stiffness configurations ref red sft at gust load case and case at cruise is shown in figure clcruisear as with the ar configuration the additional induced lift causes the wing structure to deflect and oscillate around the stationary flight condition with load case once more reaching higher maximum  values in addition it also appears that  cannot be increased above a maximum value indicating that as for the ar wing a liftlimiting effect occurs on the wingthe wing tip deformation in time for the different stiffnesses compared to the undisturbed steady state flight condition of the gust scenarios case and case are presented in figure arcruisegustwingtipdeformation as with the ar configuration the wing twists up in the event of a small gust lengths a clear difference can be observed in the case gust scenario in which the wing twists up as well the wings inertia thus plays a dominant role in both gust length cases the wing structures used here do not have sufficient torsional stiffness so that the desired washout only occurs after a more severe wing bending deflectionadditionally the deflection  and  along the span is illustrated in figure arcruisegustdeformationref with the undisturbed steady state condition at  indicated in black the elastic deformation of the case is plotted in green and the case gusts scenario in blue the minimum and maximum deformation are marked as solid lines compared to the ar wing all ar configurations achieve noticeably higher deflections with increasing structural flexibility the amplitudes become correspondingly largerexternal load resultsthe external loads as root bendingtorsion diagram for cruise case and case are depicted in figure arcruisecaseload and figure arcruisecaseload the markers in turn indicate the initial state at  with the development over time indicated by the arrow in general it can be observed that a substantially higher load level occurs in the root bending moment  and torsion moment in both gust load case and case the ar wing design shows a less effective load reduction characteristic for the structurally more flexible configuration in the cruise scenario due to the reduced torsional stiffness all investigated wing configurations twist up resulting in a higher local aoa and thus higher external loads are induced this means that the studied ar configurations cannot benefit from any gust load alleviation mechanism in comparison to the ar configurationthe wing lift distribution at different time steps for the ar ref configuration is shown in figure arcruiseliftdistribution the undisturbed steady distribution at  is plotted in blue the additional time steps are again plotted for the peak values of  cyan  green and  yellow when comparing the lift distribution at the time of the maximum lift cyan it is noticeable that although there is a slight reduction in lift between  this is not as dominant as in the ar configuration furthermore it can be noted that the time between reaching the maximum load and the maximum deflection is noticeably shorter than with the ar configuration when reaching the maximum wing deflection the aerodynamic load has already decreased significantly and there are no noticeable stall indications in opposite to the ar wing flow separation occurs when the load maximum is reached and starts to reattachthe surface friction coefficient  contour plot in figure arcruiseflowseperation illustrates the detached flow for the three wing stiffnesses ref red and sft at maximum  during the gust case

progression of  for the three stiffness configurations ref red sft at gust load case and case at cruise is shown in figure clapproachar similar to the ar wing a difference in the maximum induced  for the varying stiffness versions is observed in case the same is true for the vibration which is more strongly damped due to the higher air densitythe deflections of the wing tips can be found in figure arapproachgustwingtipdeformation as in cruise flight an initial upturn of the wing tips can be observed in the approach when interacting with the gust the corresponding  deflection and twist

figure arapproachcaseload for case for the short gust length case essentially the same conclusions can be drawn as in the cruise case due to the lower stiffness and the associated twist up of the wing the wing root section loads  and  increase in load case however a trend change can be observed the red structural design shows a slightly reduced bending moment with comparable maximum torsional moment  the even more flexible sft wing does not show this advantage any longer and results in an increased torsional moment a clear trend statement between wing stiffness and external load reduction cannot be found for the last load caseclassification of the wings gust response characteristicsin the previous chapters the most fundamental results on the gust behaviour of the ar and ar aircraft wings are presented in the following the results of the wing structural deformation and induced external loads will be analysed in more detail the aim is to list the individual effects and categorise the loadreduction characteristicsstandard casestarting point for this purpose is approach flight scenario  of the ar wing this case is of interest as it shows the characteristics of load reduction performance that are generally considered to be beneficial figure arapproachcasegutstinteraction shows the results for the transverse section load  root bending moment  and the wings tip deflection  as well as rotation  at the time when the wing begins to encounter the gust the three stiffness versions ref red and sft are individually represented by different line types for a better representation of all quantities in a common diagram each is normalised with the maximum amplitude of the respective reference stiffness ref result the most significant correlations are as followsthe time transient behaviour of the external shear force  at the wing root corresponds to the lift force generated by the wing in light blue the gust response of a rigid wing is illustrated as a reference and in black the flexible wings response in comparison to the meneuver flight the additional lift in a gust load case is not desired as can be seen from the red and sft results the load decreases with a more flexible wingthe progression of the bending moment  is shown in yellow as with the transverse force  a loadreducing can be observed with a more flexible structural design due to the wing sweep the gust peak does not occur uniformly on the wing so that the moment peak load occurs with an offsetwith a more flexible wing considerably more negative twist  is achieved meaning that the local aoa is reduced by a greater magnitude the lower aoa reduces the lift and results in decreasing external loads  the more flexible wings lead to more bending deflection the correlation between deflection and washout is explained in the academic model of chapter kap in this study similarly a link between deflection and washout twist can be founddue to the inertia of the wing it is noticeable that the deflection only sets in with considerable time offsetat the beginning of the gust encounter it can be seen that the wing twists upwards increasing the aoa this corresponds to the opposite characteristic which is not intended in the design this negative effect increases slightly with a lower wing stiffness this is caused by the lift force which is in front of the elastic wing axis and thus creates a positive torsional moment however the washout from the wing bending is not yet active point due to the twist up at the beginning of the gust encounter point  the external loads are higher than in the rigid wing caseshort excitation casethe second category is a gust scenario with a short wave length causing a short excitation of the structure the applied study case is approach flight scenario  of the ar wing as before the transfer root force  root bending moment  and the wings tip deflection  as well as rotation  are evaluated for the different wing stiffnesses the results for the case gust is presented in figure arapproachcasegutstinteraction the key correlations identified arebetween maximum transfers force  and bending moment  peak point an offset in time can again be observed compared to the rigidbody gust the lift induced trough the gust up wind increases faster the external load increases with a more flexible wing configuration the higher transfers peak load in the elastic configuration compared to the rigid wing is an indication that the local aoa is increasedwhen it comes to wing twist it can again be noticed that the more flexible configurations twists up more this in turn increases the local aoa and thus the external loadingby the time the wing reaches washout at all the gust and the maximum load point have already been exceededthe correlation between wing bending and washout can also be seen in this scenario the correlation between deflection and washout can be identified in this scenario as well but the inertia leads to such strong time lag that no load reduction advantage can be achieved the only way to alleviate the peak loads is to have a higher wing torsional stiffness so that the twist up can be reducedspecial case of highly flexible wingfurthermore a gust scenario with large wing flexibility is discussed such as the ar configuration at gust load case in approach the transfer root force  root bending moment  wing tip deflection  and rotation  for the different wing stiffnesses is shown in figure arapproachcasegutstinteraction the main interactions identified areit is noticeable that the phase between maximum wing lift shear force  and bending moment has shifted this means that the lift increases faster in the span wise direction towards the wing tips than in the root positionin addition the wing shows a distinct upturn at the beginning of the gust encounter this indicates the already described reduced torsional wing stiffness which then also induces higher loads compared to the rigid body solution this is also in line with the observation in point  that the wings torsional stiffness is more softwith more structural flexibility the up twist is further intensified when reaching the bending maximum the wing has not yet achieved a clearly recognisable washout for load reductioncomparing the peak position between the elastic wing and the rigidbody wing it is noticeable that the peak load is reached much earlier during the gust encounter the highly flexible wing shows a significantly different response when determining the peak load point compared to the standard case which is based on the ar wing the peak load is dominated by the interaction at gust initiation when no washout is achieved point in the further progression the correlation between wing deflection and washout can be recognised as wellif there is enough wing deflection the washout can be increased with a more flexible wing and thus a lower load level can be achievedspecial case of flow separationthe last specific case considered involves the occurrence of flow separation this effect is strongly dependent on the wing and airfoil design and therefore difficult to describe in general and valid terms what can be observed in this study is shown in figure arcruisecasegutstinteraction and discussed based on the ar configuration at cruise flight there are only small differences between the elastic and rigid wing with regard to the maximum shear force  to observed basically the wings lift is capped by flow separation the reason that the elastic configuration still has slightly smaller amplitudes is that not the entire wing is affected there are still areas where the flow is present and a load reduction can be achieved by washoutonce more an up twist of the wing at the entry point of the gust upwind field can be notedin this case the bending moment accumulates faster than the additional lift due to the limitation in lift the bending moment will ultimately drop as wella coupling between wing bending deflection and washout can also be detected in this case however there are no noticeable positive effects as the peak load has already been exceeded the more flexible wing configurations show a loadreducing effect but this no longer influences the exceeded peak loadsummary and discussion of the gust load resultsthe results of the transient gust load simulation indicate a number of variations in the external load reduction characteristic compared to the quasistationary analysis the most important aspects that are identified aresimilar to chapter kap the reduction of the external aerodynamic loads depends on the gust gradient short gust lengths in combination with more flexible wings lead to a reduction in load mitigation performancefor load cases with insufficient deflection no desired washout effect is achieved the deformation analysis shows that the wing twists up and thus the local aoa is increased with a more flexible wing this effect predominates so that this causes a negative effectthe ar wing can produce sufficient washout for long gust lengths at approach flight condition and external gust peak loads can be reduced in cruise flight however the wings deflection is stopped by the decreasing lift due to stallthe characteristics of the ar wing layout shows a clear difference to the ar configuration all structural configurations taking into account at different gust load cases and flight scenarios show a lower load reduction performance the reason for this is the insufficient torsional stiffness which dominates at the beginning of the gust encounter since there is no washout from bending deflection no effective load reduction can be achieved this confirms the results of chapter kap with the reduced order modelling example subsequently this aspect confirms its usability for fundamental design investigationsonce the ar wing has reached a minimum deflection significantly higher reductions in the local aoa can be achievedthe results obtained from the d wing gust calculation are consistent with the conclusions of the simplified academic model from chapter kap which arewithout existing wing deflection the kinematic relation causing the washout does not occur and thus the load reduction caused by a reduced local aoa is not effectivea reduced torsional wing stiffness leads to an up twist of the wing and thus to the opposite effectin the characterisation referred to as the standing case it is found that with a more flexible wing design peak loads can be reduced however in shortwave gusts and with extremely flexible wings such as the ar configuration the load reduction behaviour is dominated by torsional stiffness this is primarily due to the wing inertia at the time of the peak load when the corresponding loadreducing washout has not been sufficiently establishedthe correlation between deflection and load reduction is therefore a point worth mentioning in the context of research work on aeroelastic tailored wings with the studies shown here it is demonstrated that back swept wings have a natural load reduction with sufficient deflection the use of composite structures or tower steered composite technologies can enhance the effect of washout however it must also be taken into account that the activating mechanism is a coupling between bending and twist as well aeroelastic tailoring can therefore only help to achieve effective changes in the local aoa with smaller bending deflections however this is not intended to diminish the research work rather to consider it from a different point of viewadjustment of the stiffness along the load paths also know as stiffness tailoring in order to implement an optimal lightweight designuse of additional coupling possibilities material or geometrical in order to improve the washout especially with small deflectionsthe latter plays a major role especially in the development of extremely flexible wings as peak loads occur in the critical range where at least for the examples used in this study insufficient washout is observeddiscussion and conclusionsthis chapter summarises the research carried out first the present research work is condensed to the results and findings obtained to conclude an outlook on further research perspectives is givensummary and conclusion of the research workin order to achieve the goals of a sustainable aviation industry there is a need for new and innovative aircraft concepts that are clearly superior to todays transport aircraft in terms of performance an their environmental footprint a trend that is being pursued in both academic and industrial research to achieve these goals is the use of higher aspect ratio wings in addition to the aerodynamic advantages such configurations also bring a number of aeroelastic disadvantages since these are still difficult to predict and thus difficult to solve it has not yet been possible to implement them efficiently for transonic civil transport aircraft the investigations carried out in this study contribute on more detailed high fidelity aeroelastic simulations of flexible wings by applying advanced computational methods a better understanding of the characteristics of elastic backward swept wings under maneuver loading and gust response is achieved besides the general aeroelastic response the impact of the wings stiffness and thus the wings flexibility is of interest hence this aspect was given a primary focus in the investigation in this worka basic requirement to extend the work beyond the current state of the art of conventional aeroelastic design methods was the use of cfd methods which are able to take into account nonlinearities such as strong compressibility up to shock or flow separation for the entire work therefore higherfidelity methods based on rans and urans equations are used for aerodynamic modelling in addition the field velocity approach was applied to calculate gust loads with a fluid structure interaction aeroelastic modelling approachacademic demonstration modelfirst a simplified academic demonstration example was presented to demonstrate the modelling approach in addition the demonstration example was further utilised to study aerodynamic and structural influences on the aeroelastic behaviour for this purpose existing methods from the literature were combined to set up a d computational aeroelastic model of a backward swept wing segment in the structural model the structural stiffness was defined by means of the discrete translational and torsional springs representing the wings bending and torsional stiffness applying busemanns infinite swept wing theory the structural mechanical model was extended with an aerodynamic model and used for steadystate and transient aeroelastic simulations in the transonic and subsonic flight regimethe first central question was to investigate the influences of bending and torsional stiffness taking into account a cruise flight at  and subsonic approach flight scenario at  for this purpose static and transient gust response simulations with three different gust lengths were carried out in both analyses the same fundamental statements were foundthe ability to reduce the loads depends significantly on the ability of a sufficient bending deflection the deflection activates the dominating kinematic bendingtorsion coupling and reduces the angle of attack of the segment during any additional loading a wing that is more flexible in bending thus has a positive influence on the load reduction performancesince the aerodynamic lift force is in all cases in front of the elastic axis a torsional moment is induced which twists up the airfoil and thus induces higher angles of attack torsionally stiffer configurations that can counter this additional moment show a positive load reduction effectin this context the influence of the different gust lengths was additionally analysed the gust loading model used is the cos gust defined according to cs the three gust profiles considered have different gust lengths these were a short gust length with a impulse like characteristic a long gust length and a medium gust length as an intermediate step the maximum vertical gust speeds are adjusted according to the cs gust profile the main results arethe gust exposure time is essential to overcome inertia forces and to generate sufficient bending deflection the effect of long gust length has an advantage allowing sufficient bending deflection and thus washout to reduce the angle of attackshort gust lengths achieve an insufficient bending deflection so that the twist up effect dominates consequently torsionally stiff configurations show a better load reduction performance for small gust lengthsin the academic demonstration example the basic assumption is that the torsional and bending stiffness can be adjusted individually within this assumption a structural design that is more flexible in bending and stiffer in torsion is to be preferred with regard to the possibility of load reductionfurthermore studies on load reduction performance exploiting flow separation were carried out on the academic demonstrator model besides the flow conditions in the transonic flight region the motivation of this work was also to be able to capture the possibility of flow separation in the basic model assumption this explains the decision to apply rans or urans models in order to make such studies possible in order to allow the stall influence to become apparent the flight conditions were changed in two ways in study one the steady aerodynamic load level was incrementally lifted to operate the airfoil closer to  while in the second study the gust velocities were scaled so that  is induced by the upwind field the core statements from this study gained arestall can be used effectively for load reduction as lift is limited even if a higher vertical speed introduced by the gust or an increase through the mean steady lift there are no major differences in the peak loadsignificant differences can be seen in the poststall behaviour here cases could be identified where the flow recovers rapidly and the airfoil slowly reverts to steady flight conditions the decisive factor is the upstream flow condition and the lift increment between steadystate flight and  such moderate post stall configuration could be identified at cruise speedespecially in the approach configurations the lift collapses and drops below the lift required for steadystate flight accordingly the structure responds with strong oscillations in the torsional and bending degrees of freedomfor that specific case it is difficult to give a final assessment as the academic model does not reflect the full complexity of a d wing if the airfoil represents the entire wing a drop in lift below steady flight level is not tolerable this would mean that the aircraft could no longer sustain the trim attitude and remain altitudeon a complex d wing stall typically does not have to occur abruptly on the entire wing however a reduction of the load through partial wing stall might be possiblewhen analysing the influence of different gust vertical speeds the following observations were madewith increased vertical speed the load reduction characteristic can be scaled linearly until flow separation is achieved if the critical lift is exceeded it is limited by stall regardless of whether more angle of attack is inducedthe passive load reduction performance is dependent on the gust length for small gust lengths only minor reductions can be achieved a wing configuration being more flexible in bending shows a better possibility to reduce additional lift the statements made at the beginning could thus be confirmed for the more general study with different gust lengths and gust vertical speedscivil transport aircraft simulationin the second part of this work aeroelastic models of two civil transport aircraft configurations were investigated the research objective was to investigate the influence of wing configurations with different stiffness characteristics using simulations of steadystate maneuver and transient gust response for these purposes two aircraft configurations were implemented with different wing planforms a configuration with an aspect ratio of  as well as a novel configuration with an aspect ratio of  as far as possible both configurations have been developed to meet the same operational parameters to influence the stiffness of the wings different pseudo artificial materials were introduced the stiffness of the wing was influenced by changing the material properties so that wings with the same planform but different stiffnesses could be realised geometric influences were studied directly between the ar and ar configurations the modelling of the wing structure and its deformations was carried out using fem a simplified presizing process was implemented for this purpose so that the structural design corresponds to the predefined load specifications a special feature of this work is that the structure is not developed from the stress free unloaded jigshape as usual instead it was developed around a predefined target flight shape therefore it could be ensured that all wing configurations with the same planform have the same lift distribution in the design point despite different stiffnesses thus determining the corresponding jigshape required to fulfil the intended flight shape was part of the design process the resulting models were then used for quasisteady pull up maneuver studies and transient gust response analysesin the maneuver load study the different wing planforms with different structural stiffness were investigated for their passive aerodynamic load reduction potential at higher load factors for this purpose a trimmed quasisteady pull up maneuver flight was considered at different flight speeds this includes two low speed   and two cruise flight scenarios   with the different fuel loading conditions the essential findings arein both ar and ar configuration the wings reach limit load only with approach flight conditions in the cruise case the wings cannot provide sufficient lift so that stall occurs before design limit load  is reachedthe transverse shear force as well as the bending and torsional moment resulting from the aerodynamic forces were evaluated as an assessment criterion for the load reduction ability with different stiffnessesthe reduction of the transverse shear forces was only possible to a small extent this was due to the circumstance that the necessary lift must be generated for a given maneuver flight in maneuver flight the transverse force can therefore only be reduced by transferring it partially from the wing to the fuselagein the pullup maneuver flight cases with flow separation it has been shown that the load reduction potential is reduced the reason for this is originate from the lower bending deflection due to the lower lift this also had a negative impact on wing sections where the flow is still attached the reduction in load was stopped and the local angle of attack increased the occurrence of stall can therefore be classified as a limiting factor of load reductionmore flexible wing configurations were in all studies able to generate a higher load reduction potential the best results compared to steadystate flight were obtained for the ar wing in the takeoff scenario the reduction in bending moment is up to  and that of the torsional moment up to  for the ar configurations the best reduction in bending moment were achieved during approach with up to  and for the torsional moment in takeoff with that the best results are obtained for the takeoff and approach flight scenarios is consistent with the observations from the academic demonstrator study in both flight conditions the bending deflection of the wing compared to the wing flight shape is largest until the maximum is reached thus in relative terms more washout can be generatedfrom a relative point of view the ar wing has a slightly better maneuver load reduction capability however the consideration of absolute loads must be taken into account here it can be statedthe ar wing generally has higher root bending and torsional moments due to its geometric features the mean loading level at  is considerably lower for the ar planform so that the peak loads are smallerin addition takeoff and approach flight scenario do not represent the load cases with the highest external forces in this study cruise flight with full wing tank was identified as the critical load case for which the peak load reduction is significantly lowerin the second part the different wing types were analysed in terms of their gust characteristics taking into account both cruise and approach flight scenario the effect of wing stiffness on the load reduction potential under different gusts length was investigated as well in this work four possibilities of gust responses were identified as they may occur in a gust exposure with a flexible wing the essential findings arethe load reduction potential is in turn strongly linked to the wing bending deflection for all gust load cases it was identified that the local angle of attack initially increases upon gust initiation this is essentially because the wing does not yet have any bending deflection due to its inertia due to the extra induced lift the wing starts to twist upwhether a load reduction is possible is thus dependent on the relative phase of the washoutfor long gusts lengths the duration of the gust action is sufficient to produce sufficient wing bending so that the washout begins before the peak load is reached in this case the peak load can be reduced and improved using more flexible wingsin the case of short gust lengths flow separation or extremely flexible configurations such as the ar planform the load reduction behaviour is decisive due to the structural properties at the beginning of the gust encounter in this case the peak loads are reached before sufficient deflection has been achieved thus the peak load is reached in the phase when the wing is still in an unfavourable condition where the local aoa is increased due to the up twist for all these cases the stiffer wing configurations have performed betterthe evaluations of the ar configuration have shown that after reaching the significantly more massive wing deflections the reduction through washout dominates due to inertia and lower torsional stiffness no configuration in this study was able to exploit this advantage thus all the results and especially the peak loads were characterised by the initial gust interactionoutlook and recommendationsthe results described in this thesis have shown that flexible sweptback wings have the potential to alleviate loads passively however a number of conclusions can be stated which offer a direction for further investigationsan important point concerns the elimination of further modelling assumptions that influence the results this includes for example the consideration of the rigid body motion of the aircraft this was deliberately omitted in this work as the complex overall system was to be reduced as much as possible the introduction of the aircraft rigid motion requires the modelling of the empennage as well as the definition of further system parameters such as eg the natural pitch damping or flight control inputs even though the relative statements were in the foreground in this work the model extension is indispensable in order to obtain higherquality absolute measuresa further need is to use improved presizing methods the sizing process proposed here is a tradeoff approach the use of a further optimised structural design can indicate further optimisation potentials especially with regard to gust load reduction it would be of interest to see to what extent a wing designed with aeroelastic tailoring methods can reduce the initial up twist of the wing during gust initiationin this work particular focus was set on the possibility of external aerodynamic load reduction by washing out the additionally induced angle of attack this is justified since the lift force has the greatest influence in terms of absolute magnitude especially during the acceleration phases of the aircraft for example during pullup maneuver the inertia loads contribute to the possible load reduction through a compensation of the additional lift load for a more detailed analysis the internal structural loads can therefore be used as further load alleviation assessment criteria

caregiver may experience social restrictions financial strain emotional distress and gain personal burdenthe investigation of this dissertation is focused on assisting tailoredmanner informal caregivers in decisionmaking the intervention proposed is through a cognitive system cs given its capabilities to perceive environmental variables make inferences according to its present context where the software might be interaction with regardless of the interface it can process store and learn from past experiences like a patients health progression or screening history ultimately a cs can propose future actions based on what it has already known anticipate and even adapt vernon a due to those abilities to perform not preprogrammed decisions artificially we believe it would be a good candidate for our workresearch questionthe main idea was to extract from that methodology more detailed motivations validate assumptions and guide the dissertation see table  for more detailsrq could a cognitive system assist people with caring for people with dementia in decisionmaking related to caremain objectivethe main objective is suggesting a model of cognitive system to assist caregivers in personalized decisionmaking through agentsspecific objectivesto propose a model of a cognitive system to assist caregivers in decisionmaking for persons living with dementiato assist decisionmaking in a lab environment and validate the system abilities to adjusting against our dataset based on theoretical literaturemotivationat the time of this writing  of cases of dementia worldwide are not being diagnosed international university  it may reach  in lowmiddleincome countries due to resources restrictions early and accurate diagnosis could save up to usd  trillion in medical and care costs  alzheimers disease facts and figures  additionally data suggests an increase of dementia occurrence due to population agingdementia is also a longterm illness with one of the high costs to public healthcare mainly in lowerincome countries due to limited resources that said we realized the existence of a greenfield of literature to support our tentative of creating a cognitive system that assists caregivers decisionmaking in a tailored manner we also aimed to develop resources and begin the consolidation of an interdisciplinary knowledge domain to face dementia care as well as incentive further research moreover we have no knowledge of any work attempting to implement a similar approachstructure of the textthis dissertation aims to address the research

description of each term used throughout this workbackground workdementiadementia is a progressive degeneration of the neurons disease neurodegenerative characterized by declining functional and cognitive abilities lamahewa et al  it interferes with daily living and social autonomy once memory thinking and behavior are impacted dementia is known as a major neurocognitive disorder and represents a variety of diseases such as alzheimer vascular dementia dementia with lewy bodies frontotemporal dementia and youngonset dementia and the diagnosis is executed by clinical tests eg clinical dementia rating with laboratory tests and brain imaging international university  in some cases it may be necessary a multidisciplinary engagement of doctors to specify the dementia type once there is no single clinical screening available to provide a conclusive result samsi manthorpe according to the global deterioration scale for assessment of primary degenerative dementia there are seven stages of cognitive impairment progression starting off from stages  to  of dementia these are known as predementia on stage  there is no cognitive decline it is a normal functioning stage in which the patient does not face any cognitive impairment stage  is defined as ageassociated memory impairment it means occasional lapses of memory in living activities and sometimes is like normalaging decline which might be the earliest symptoms of dementia and almost undetectable through clinical assessments only stage  is mild cognitive impairment mci given the disease progression this phase represents a decline between normal agerelated decline to early dementia the main symptoms are notable memory and performance in the dailytasks losses the succeeding phase is the fourth named mild dementia when often the patient starts to try denying symptoms and gets worse memory loss such as disorientation and difficulty to recognize faces from stage  on the pwd usually requires some assistance daily but still can handle physiologic needs further the sixth stage is moderately severe dementia which requires intense supervision by caregivers the patient commonly presents anxiety loss of willpower and agitation or sometimes aggression with potential hallucinations lastly severe dementia is the worse stage of illness it has high cognitive impairments the patient progressively loses core capabilities and often the brain changes in hippocampal volume see fig  for a sample of alzheimers diseasedata suggests a prevalence of dementia worldwide due to the aging population this pathology progression is not linear it progresses through several pathways with sudden movements lamahewa et al  throughout the patient life and decisions about patient care are critical to enhancing the quality of life the level pwd involvement in decisionmaking is proportional by the level of impairment the relationship with the caregiver professional or informal person such as family member holding the role of taking care of someone and autonomy desireddecisionmaking in dementia carethe decisionmaking ability required from a person acting as the caregiver may expand from finances to endoflife care and it should be done in a timely manner with often high complexity shippee rowan henningsmith  the decisions in the dementia care process require a combination of abilities and should vary according to the patients capacity and will besides the care knowledge available the knowledge is needed to make a decision that might vary depending on either disease stage or patients health conditions once neurogenerative diseases like alzheimer are highly individualized trugliolondrigan slyer a due to the absence of a standard pathway as described earliercognitive systemthere is no easy definition for cognition but the term cognitive science was born in the early s from cybernetics group it was a set of disciplines such as neuroscience cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence among others that held a goal to model an artificial agent that somehow will try yield human cognition or create a science of the mind with logic back in  newell and simon released a paper describing a kind of protocol to solve general problems or general problem solver gps it might be one of the first formalizations of a cognitive system formalized in architecture it was a multipurpose attempt to represent a broad range of cognitive challenges the gps was based on a symbolic structure in which symbol was a physical pattern later they published a goaloriented system that has the intelligence to use its knowledge onto every problem to achieve goals somehow we adopted this concept to our experiment newell simon a cognitive architecture ca goes beyond a unique formalization it has an important role as a concrete idea of cognitive theory and model how a system sense reason act and theoretically describe the software frameworks paraense et al  since its creation we have seen the usage of this term in a general sense to refer to artificial and biological cognitive systems a ca is an explicit formalization of a cognitive system and its modules such as memories processes and knowledge vernon  in our case it means a representation of our tentative to create a system with artificial memory learning attention and assistive decisionmaking abilities it refers to the human mind aspects newell simon  and it is not a specialized entity to perform welldefined tasks instead it should perform actions based on its knowledge with broaddomain although a ca would be applied to unlimited use cases according to kotseruba and tsotsos  publication they evaluated the last  years of architectures development and concluded that there is not exponentially growth of new propositions it usually remains on top of already known cognitive architectures kotseruba tsotsos within this tentative of creating an artificial humanlike cognition there is an agent that according to david vernon  is an artificial entity or system holding cognitive capacity in other words it will understand the systems context perform actions and it will interact with the environment vernon b we proposed a system with structural knowledge crafted by healthcare professionals and credited support communities the particular domain characteristic can arguably be enhanced by machine learning models but it will require supervised instructions at the first stage to establish a formalist of knowledgerelated worksno related work was found in our systematic review presenting a formal cognitive system to address caregivers challenges however we found few correlated approaches such as the zhao et al s publication that investigates early detection using an artificial intelligence model from a similar database it processes images from magnetic resonance screening then they created a diagnostic framework for dementia but initially only focusing on alzheimer disease subjects besides that we are using a similar data exploration by looking at the imaging dataset for quantitative measures of patients brain pathology as a data sourcesystematic reviewa qualitative systematic review sr based on budgen and brereton budgen brereton  guidelines was undertaken and is presented in this section we adopted this method to identify caregivers decisions and understand characteristics of technology interventions to assist caregivers on dementia care for this sr purpose the protocol that was chosen consists of population intervention comparison outcome and context picoc criteria that said the population includes publications that report dementia care caregivers of people living with dementia or alzheimer and decisionmaking related to care the intervention was based on assistive technologies or nonpharmaceutics tools that support decisions and shared decisions the comparison does not apply to our research objectives because we could not find a similar artificial cognitive system in dementia care to compare the outcomes expected are fundamental references towards a cognitive system to potentially assist caregiver decisions thus we considered context publications that examine dementia care decisionmaking scenarios and care interventionsreview questionswe created three review questions to guide our screening process see table table   research questions and motivationsinclusion and exclusion criteriathe full inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in table  there were no geographic limitations but we applied a filter to get novel results excluding results older than  yearssearch strategythe search process was performed on november th  and was not automated few trials were executed to find satisfactory and relevant studies the search string was slightly modified to each database engine to adjust the search engine parameters we also established a proper search string see fig  to conduct this review merging a few wordsdementia caredementia caregiverdecisionsdecisionmakinginterventionstechnologyand cognitive systemthe keywords were chosen based on research questions but we made refinements using the medical subject headings mesh an organized vocabulary produced by the national library of medicine it is used for indexing cataloging and searching biomedical and healthrelated information the final string was dementia caregiver decisions and decisionmaking were combined through or boolean operator the same strategy was executed to interventions technology and cognitive architecture an and operator was used to merge the search string in the research boundaries the final search string that we have applied is as follows see fig dementia caregiver and decisions or decisionmaking and interventions or technology or cognitive architecturefig   search string performed in nov table   inclusion and exclusion criteria and their justificationsto ensure our readership we considered only articles either written in american and british english or brazilian portuguese languages we rely on the validity of the findings and we considered theoretical approach empirical cases and studies cases then we settled a timeframe from  on aiming to retrieve relatively recent works three databases were searched ieee xplorer pubmed and sciencedirect databases they were chosen by convenience as well as ad hence to coordenao de aperfeioamento de pessoal de nvel superior capes and comunidade acadmica federada cafe network provided by the federal university of so paulo unifespassessment of qualitythe papers were rated by quality independently onto parfial an online tool designed to support researchers to perform systematic reviews of the literature within the context ofsoftware engineering see table  to complete  list of quality assessment questions each question was manually done along with the other classification methods on the selected articles these questions were needed because the assessor might be potentially led by bias and some studies were not fully comprehensive either due to missing information or limits of the reviewers understanding of a specific knowledge domainthreats to validitywe had some risks of bias in studies selection once most of them were selected based on their title and abstract some of them adopted a qualitative methodology where we had some potential bias application or in other words it might have a vague valuable once this potential is not measurable in most cases another risk was related to quality score considering that some qualitative questions that received partially value can lay down on very different stages another threat is caused because of diverse options to intervein within dementia care literature articles and texts published resulting in the interdisciplinary subject and sometimes lack of knowledge might make barriers to understanding to minimize threats we set research objectives and picked up clear definitions to create a baseline during the synthesis phase we took it as a reference and looked for similar concepts we also pursued minimizing and mitigating validity threats in the researchstudy selectionfrom the results perspectives of our study we summed up a total of  results included in the initial phase of this systematic review all accepted papers were downloaded into mendeley reference manager software to execution of screening phase see fig  to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and metaanalyses prisma workflowresultsstudy characteristicsmost reviews did not focus on technology choice instead some of them presented core concepts such as assistive technologies or home monitoring through sensors and telemetry as result only  studies met the inclusion criteria described earlier see fig  from a temporal view we could see an increasing number of results in recent years then we can take as hypotheses that the recent advancements of artificial intelligence neural networks areas have apparently raised technology for healthcare in academic works although the apparent increase in the number of studies the absence of a tentative of applying an artificial cognitive architecture in dementia care corroborates with the belief that this is still a cuttingedge technology for the current century and the dementia context has been somewhat neglectedthe overall number of the studies was reasonable since this is an innovative technology with few partial or no current implementations due to actual research limits we have seen several results with superficial analyses mainly to the most used word artificial intelligence to support early detection home safety of even embed in social robots among the publications we see an opportunity to refine a few definitions and create standards to allow the academic community interested to have the same sense of meaning and beginning from the same sourcemost results were from scientific databases part of this process was described in fig  we obtained results for this work and applied a few criteria to get a coherent synthesis of the result the majority number of papers was found in pubmed then in second place sciencedirect and third ieee xplore   studies   studies and   studies respectively we have not included manually inserted papers na major part of results is from uk and netherlands  followed by usa with  studies or  canada is the third table  provides an overview of methodology characteristics just over half of the studies adopted a qualitative approach  the mixed when qualitative and quantitative are used in the same paper was adopted by almost onethird  further  adopted quantitative and undefined it happens whenever we could neither identify nor found an explicit methodology represent  of resultswe created overall categories to try evaluating quality in the screening process low moderate and high with a range score from  to   to  and above  respectively the score was created using the rating criteria see table  described in section the role of information technology in disease managementnew tools based on information technology are currently being researched to support people with dementia and their caregivers hudson cohenly  we found some of the results focused on assistive technology at a term to describe systems that improve the functional capabilities of a disabled person atia  it is a broad research field that may incorporate edge devices and sensors with characteristics to assist a human task based on our sr assistive technologies are being applied to home motoring aiming enhance elderly safety against accidental falls robinson et al  with monitoring behavior such a system that could activate a lighting system whenever need overnight or a home sensor to raise alarms in case of fall detection it also can provide services to support daily living such as remembering medication functional tasks and might be referenced as ambient assisted living aal systems phull liscano mihailidis  another usage within our query was to detect anomalies in a routine manner the system could observe abnormal signals whenever the user is cooking eg misusing appliances or face difficulties with independent living chalmers et al although adoption of this kind of technology in dementia care is important to improve the quality of life of patients a challenge might be a misuse or sometimes the people with dementia are unable to use given limited experience it motivated zhang et al  investigation towards built a general predictive model to overcame acceptance barriers davies et al  publication states that the notable issue with at is the breadth of services available often to the elderly population in general without addressing tailored needs of dementia care and span et al  raises a discussion on ethical and privacy risks of assistive technologies due to the obtrusiveness of them in patients home environment without clear limits of data gathering and managementanother role found for information technologies was early detection according to polikar et al  there is an urgent need for tools that find with accuracy in an affordable manner and nonintrusive behavior focused on early diagnosis or prediction of dementias we also saw approaches of neural networks focused on avoiding ambiguities in decision making as presented by eklund  moreover artificial cognition we found enhanced social robots capacity to aid and interact with external environments elderly people or even dementia care proposed by romeo et al the caregiver of people with dementiaroughly  million of people are informal caregivers in usa or almost  of us population according to  us census they are hidden victims of dementia once their role can be stressful and exhaustive we could notice a lack of preparedness to provide care in our sr and the number of people with access to professional services is low for this research purpose we aimed a shareddecision approach using a solid theoretical background from certified data sources such as international organizations or healthcare professionals it will not be a unique party decision instead shared decisionmaking is the involvement of a person with dementia depending on cognitive impairment and their caregiver  it seems that opportunities exist to improve readiness once the sr studies have pointed to misinformation as target to control risk factors to dementiadisease detectiona variety of clinical tools are currently being used to diagnose illnesses related to dementia advanced machine learning models have been applied to disease detection focusing on unveiling the complexities of the brain and its neurological system the detection of early symptoms might be important to advanced care planning the current approach of detection has been computeraided to enhance the diagnosis with magnetics resonances images using advanced deep learning algorithms based on layering the artificial neural networks ann to feature extraction and consequently classificatory results zhao et al in this chapter we presented the materials used throughout the work as well as the methodology adoptedmaterials usedthe cognitive systems toolkit cstthe experiment was designed on a model to conceptually validate the application of a cognitive system to assist caregivers decisions the experiment is a qualitative and quantitative laboratory study to execute managed simulations as proof of concept thus the cognitive toolkit chosen for experiment purposes is based on the cognitive systems toolkit cst a project developed by university of campinas unicamp researchers that aimed to embed cognitive architectures providing flexibility to pick up the best piece of each architecture adopting cst we were able to create a cognitive agent without lockin to unique architecture and develop simulations for cognitive reasoning perception etc the cst is codeletbased each codelet is a welldefined agent with main cognitive functions encapsulated in small pieces of code and it can behave fully parallel asynchronously the multiagent system can be organized by a module called coderack this component is a kind of waiting room of all active codelets mitchell another interesting feature is the management of hardware resources to enhance processing moreover the cst handles memory as an important element the memory object can store information and can have many different uses the documentation describes a few types sensory perceptual episodic working semantic procedural and motor memories lastly there is an rcore implemented on top of cst with built blocks intrinsically connected with its codelets a possible analogy is a human brain connected to nervous systems that trigger signals to the entire body when achieving predefined thresholds paraense et al aiming to potentially address caregivers needs presented earlier we consider csts flexibility a pivotal characteristic to develop a suitable experiment we built a simple model to run this experiment presented in section  it was written in java programming language using a few components of cst toolkit see fig the oasis databasea wide variety of data is available with different requirements to access and formats however we decided to use free databases with data extraction from brain measurements then after an intense search we found out a collection of  adults scanned in magnetic resonance imaging mri sessions compiled and freely distributed by the open access series of imaging studies oasis platform after acceptance of a data use agreement the dataset chosen has interesting crosssectional as well as longitudinal information and it has been managed by researchers from entities such as knight alzheimers disease research center adrc and mallinckrodt institute of radiology and xnat project an opensource imagingbased platform both from washington university in st louis and neuroinformatics research group nrgthe participants were aged from  to  years old at the screening moment the oasis collection consists of both men and women where  people were characterized as nondemented throughout the study and  as demented at the time of their initial visit and remained so for subsequent scans including  individuals with mild to moderate alzheimers disease in the longitudinal aspect  subjects were characterized as nondemented at the time of their initial visit and were subsequently characterized as demented at a later visit and each person was scanned on two or more visits separated by at least one year for a total of  imaging sessions marcus et al the field descriptions underneath our work are presented in table  and described as follows group refers to what characterization was found at the moment of mri screening and it may be demented or nondemented the hand field refers to participants dominant hand for this research purposes we are only considering left or right and excluding ambidextrous persons age at the moment of mri gender refers to male or female according to participants answer educ refers to the number of formal education years ses refers to socioeconomic status at the exam moment in accordance to north americans measurements we also got clinical data from participants as mmse refers to a point exam wellknown to identify dementia cdr refers to clinical dementia rating from  to  that indicates mild moderate or severe dementia morris  the following fields are global neurology measures of brain volume etiv refers to the estimated total intracranial volume or nwbv or normalize whole brain volume into the intracranial cavity and lastly asf that refers to the atlas scaling factor a variable to balance differences in human brain anatomy regardless the age buckner et al  we were able to read process and analyze the dataset consequently we build artifacts to document our journey so farthe weka toolsthe weka framework was built at the university of waikato in new zealand for machine learning ml algorithms and data processing it made processing and testing ml models easy it is an opensource code written in java and distributed under the terms of the gnu general public license it also has vast online documentation and samples availableamong the options of data mining model to regressions clustering attribute selection association or classifications we used the one of weka decision trees classifier builtin against our dataset it is part of the overall library that we implemented in our java project the weka project has few interfaces we benefit from using the code version with no graphical interface instead of the user client interface to easily integrate our development software chosenintegrated development environment

httpswwwelseviercomsolutionsmendeleyparsifalthe tool used to manage the systematic review of literature was parsifal the web portal was navigated at httpparsifalmethodologythe core of this research is exploring cognitive technologies for benefit of caregivers to achieve this target we proposed earlier through an experiment to assist caregivers decisionmaking on basic daytoday activities and due to the novelty characteristic of this work the methodology is based on design science research methodology dsrm this approach is often used in engineering and information systems areas and to design and create artifacts simon  we based on a step process starting problem identification the definition of aims design demonstration evaluation and communication peffers et al  as presented in fig in the next section we will detail each stage appropriatelyidentify problem  motivationthe problem definition is a stage where we identify what value the solution brings and the user target in our case we are focusing on informal caregivers of people with dementia dementia care has one of the highest costs globally and the data suggests the lack of information might be one of the big challenges of care pathways it impacts informal caregivers decisionsas part of problem identification we developed a systematic review as presented in section chapter  peffers et al  according to our research the problem target deal with the complexity of caregivers decisions on dementia caredefining objectives of a solutionthe systematic review guided our conclusions and the research objective that said the defined objective of the solution create a cognitive system to assist caregivers decisionmaking through an artificial agentdesign  developmentfor this study we built as the main artifact a model of cognitive system see fig  based on cognitive systems toolkit it is a novel approach towards an interdisciplinary asset in the first step we collected data from the open access series of imaging studies oasis a compiled collection of neuroimaging clinical and cognitive research datasets then we applied statistical algorithms to create math models that found corrections in a simulated laboratory environmentin the succeeding phase we aimed to develop a model to assist decisionmaking based on reference theory and provide suggestions for action selection that determines at any point in time the next action the experiment proposed data to enhance decision in other words the system provides information that potentially assists caregivers of people living with dementia in daily bases decisionsdemonstrationthe main idea is developing proof of concept of a system hypothetically connected with healthcare platforms that can provide patients screening information such as mris biological measurements and doctors diagnosis given the scope limitations we did not develop an interface to manually insert data instead we focused on extracting from a static database the system is not intended to diagnosis nor replace a human professional we aimed to present sentences obtained from alzheimers association as informative content to each patient of the dataset in a tailored manner the end user target was informal caregivers we expected present instructions from reliable sources to support their daily decisions related to care the cognitive perspective was conceptually achieved by our experiment when it handled artificial elements through an artificial agent such as memory management and dementia care knowledgeevaluationsthe system has been using theory from academic resources however to model validation we proposed the three validation rings the first one is based on simulation rounds in which the systems performance would be measured by metrics each round is a set of first  instances of our dataset they were processed over the course of a single simulation to validate the prototype and measure its performance when compared to other proposals metrics were defined  average number median standard deviation etc of correct answers per round metric that shows how many times the artificial agent was able to achieve the preestablished classification or coherent answer  average time tenths of a second the total time required for the agent to reach the goal andor  number of executions since programs have different structures and complexities the time does not always fully reflect their capabilitiessecondly we evaluated according to the technology level of readiness tlr metrics the tlr is a ninelevel ordinal scale created by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa in the s to evaluate hardware technology maturity in aerospace applications for instance a project rated by  represents flight qualified  conrow  however it has been also used in other scenarios beyond nasa project management weve found a few papers with attempts to enhance or adapt the original john mankins work contrarily those studies we decided to use the original tlr metrics as presented in table table   technology readiness level definitionthe pearsons model was used in section  where  pearson correlation range  variable samples   mean of values

section b publications in journals and seminars throughout the mastership journeyc an innovative dissertation to contribute with unifesp academic databases andd prepare assets for future interdisciplinary research on cognitive systems applied to dementia carechapter developmentdescriptive analysiswe looked at the oasis dataset presented at section  to better understand the potential uses from an analytical tool perspective we chose anaconda toolkit with jupiter notebooks and python script language to conduct an exploratory data analysis we realized a few columns with missing values we decided not to discard these lines to avoid losing data which may be valuable later considering that majority were discrete variables then we used an imputation python algorithm to overlap the missing values inferring them from the known part of the data table  presents the top  instances of our dataset where we could notice a few of ses values blanksafter exploratory analyses we were able to plot from our dataset a few analyses such as similarity of men as well as women age with a small increase of women below  years old see fig  the age of subjects is pretty much the same regardless the genderwe decided to create three different profiles for our next analyses demented nondemented and converted the converted people who got a healthy diagnostic in the first screening then got demented diagnose throughout the database registers we got a small difference when comparing the normalized whole brain volume from normal people against demented and converted it raised some hypothesis of small difference of normalized whole brain volume nwbv value in nondemented peoplestructural memorythe memory theory undertaken in our lab was created in the s the experiment was a tentative of develop cognitive system using oasis database and cst modules presented at section  it was bioinspired and considers an external stimulus from sensory dimension such as visual system in our case the incoming information was through a subsystem named attention that emulates data ingestion from the subjects screening sessions as external input the sensory register is a shortterm memory and it might execute within seconds or less another important component is shortterm storage where the information stays longer than the sensory module but does not necessarily come from sensory input it is also known as working memory we deploy an algorithm to the correlation detector described later in other words it handles the incoming data and it might be stored in longterm memory or be discarded all information is lost from the sensory and shortterm modules atkinson shiffrin the last component is the longterm storage where several kinds of information are being stored without rules to decay the longterm store has a declarative memory we decide within that context to use the episodic ability the episodic memory was a core component of our experiment given the longitudinal data analyses this kind of memory stores a temporalspatial manner past events episodes then we were able to retrieve it and explore these experienced events tulving thomson  we considered for our study purposes being an episode each subjects mri session or a newly learned pattern within our dataset moreover it is important to mention that it is not clear how the information flows in atkinson and shiffrin  model once it might be transmitted and still have a copy of that data in the component of originthe codeletsto run our experiment simulation we built a virtual environment using java programming language to develop our system the codelet is a system with welldefined action mitchell  the code below is the instantiation of three agents attention correlationdetector and nextactionwe took advantage of csts native methods such as setname to name our codelet with a string value and addinputaddoutput to handle set and get memory objects respectively the insertcodelet method has been used to insert our agents to coderack a stochastic queue during the system executionattentionfirstly we were supposed the ingestion of a stream of data from a sensorial codelet that we named attention see fig  it was our gate to receive outbound data for this experiment considering that we are only intended to focus on a technology perspective is out of lab scope diagnosis or biological data extraction from patients then we made a manual data insertion of oasis database to the attention component to formalize its role the agent main algorithm has the role of data load from csvs files see file file   the method to load dataset data in attention codeletcorrelationdetectoralthough the correlationdetector codelet ran in a lab we expected within that module to deploy a reduced context to design a system simple as much as possible our proposition of this component was processing our dataset but we foresee associations in the real world with other environmental variables or processing sensorial data from its codelets for future implementations the console outputs from correlationdetector are shown in fig to find out the association ratio between our variables we applied pearsons correlation coefficient against the dataset resulting on numeric values pearsons correlation range r indicates the strongness of the relationship it may vary from negative from  to positive  being the perfect correlation when a variable relationship reaches extreme values  or  and if the score is  it indicates no linear relationship between both values paranhos et al according to cohen  studies correlation coefficients scores from  to  represents weak from  to  medium and above  strong relationship between those variables if we use the same methodology all people in oasis dataset are righthanded so we should disregard that column and drop unnecessary ones we have got for instance mmse and cdr with strong relation  and  respectively the following file  presents the pearson formula implemented in our laboratory agentthe overview of the agent is presented below see fig  the incoming memory objects from the sensory data are processed by the algorithm it results create new memory objects named known patternsthe next actionafter the correlationdetector processing these data are stored as knowpatternsmo and sent to patternlearner see fig  from this codelet on there are opportunities to machine learning ml algorithms that potentially might land a learning ability but we decided from that bundle of available tools do not cover the patternlearner in our current experiment due to time constraints of the mastership coursefig   the information flow at codelet next actionalthough we are aware of the existence of ml algorithms with higher accuracy as well as good adherence to our dataset we want to focus on a generic approach to address most dementia care needs the next action codelet should translate the dementia professional care instructions within our straight scope as well laboratory results we decided to invest in a classificatory mechanism based on the forest tree algorithm due to the expected categorical variable output and its good accuracy against our dataset in previous community teststhroughout the experiment the engine ingests data and processes in the next phase the system provides outputs aiming to assist decisions pertaining to caregivers selfcare category trugliolondrigan slyer b it is important to mention that we are not focusing on evaluating the quality of dementia care advisory once we are using resources from the alzheimer association instead we are only focusing on the technology perspective for now the agent code can be seen in file  where the switch case logic structure was undertaken to present suggestions for each case the return string was reduced to better present in this paperworkthe complete sentence can be found at laboratory source code ideally it should not be static but given the laboratory restrictions we got the text result integrally from the alzheimer association portalthe cognitive modelto describe the model proposition we can begin with the attention codelet that should grab information seamlessly from its environment however for our laboratory study we inserted a prepared dataset with patients data from csv files for future implementation it would handle patient real biometric or physiologic data either in nrt near realtime data or static ones such mri or similar exams medical visits or even a caregivers realtime health telemetric data the attention codelet creates memory objects mo called attentionmo in episodic memory for our context an episode is data from doctor visits or mri executedthe next phase goes to our perceptual codelet named correlationdetector which was responsible for correlation analyses based on statistical theories within the codelet we have implemented pearsons correlation coefficient to find out the mutual relationship and connection between variables to statistically know the strength of the relation the correlationdetector should send data to perceptual codelet as memory objects named as knownpatternsmo this mo has data from all previously known patterns received from perception codelets of course we could implement a more robust algorithm to find our new numerical correlations wisely but due to time constraints we are limited to a simple lab for this studys purposes a pattern can be some connection either nonobvious such as normalized wholebrain volume with dementia characterization or something obvious as adult people that got clinical dementia rating from  on heshe has a high likelihood of a need for caregiver supervisionthe knownpatternsmo may trigger events simultaneously in two new codelets the nextaction responsible for planning activities has a list of standard information written to support a caregiver as well as provide to the system a kind of intelligence to pick up the best what to do next action for each patient stage of dementia progression as a result it can assist the enduser in decisionmakingthe patternlearner also might receive a signal from perceptual memory regarding the new connection raised from correlationdetector this codelet has a role of reasoning and learning from the emerging information once patternlearner has learned it can update the knownpattern with a new pattern enhancing the perceptual memory additionally we are aware of the potential information path returning a new memory object to the episodic memory to enrich its entries it is important to mention that we leave its implementation for the next developments of this modelthe experimentthe experiment started reading data from the oasis file prepared a commaseparatedvalues file csv which contains nonidentifiable magnetic images in this way we were able to obtain the results of clinical tests such as minimental state examination mmse and clinical dementia rating cdr from oasis then we had the current stage of cognitive impairment of the subject from a clinical perspective the most used is minimental state examination mmse a cognitive assessment based on questions international university the next step was to teachtrain the system with categories suggested by the literature for each stage of impairment borderline mild impairment moderate impairment moderately severe severe and very severe in other words the experiment system will classify the patients stage and provide personalized suggestions that potentially assist the caregivers decision according to the guidelines of the international alzheimer and dementia association since learning is iterative we may set the desired accuracy to stop the model the scale adopted for classificatory algorithm has been considered against the mmse as bartfay bartfay gorey  work where they attempted to create a parallel cognitive scale using mmse as baselinetable   minimental examination interpretation based on the bartfay bartfay gorey  researchin our lab the system internally matches the alzheimers association advice with the patient record the system processes and presents the possible state of dementia pathway according to the mmse scale then the experiment provides resources to help caregiving through each stage of the disease trying to enhance knowledge of caregiver the nature of the resource was conceptually provided to caregiver orientations in each simulation round the user can have access to reliable insightsthe home screen see fig  has a blank field to caregivers insert the patient number in our simulation an identificatory number was the ordinary order of register in our dataset considering that we have got roughly  subjects any number from  to  would be typed as patient id then the next action should be to click on the get assistance button  the next screen is showed up an insight provided according to resources from the alzheimer internacional association the fig  is an example of a mild cognitive impairment casechapter results and discussionresultsthe system was executed in simulation cycles in which the systems performance was measured by execution time  a cycle was a set of  runs a run was a single instance of our dataset starting from the first to the hundredth item of oasis each run was processing of a base record over the course of a single simulation to measure we collected data from the execution time or the number of nanoseconds needed to getsuggestion see file  method completes its objectivefrom the simulation we collect the median arithmetic and the standard deviation  sec and  seconds respectively the average time sec is the total time required for the agent to present result to the user divided by the number of executions the standard deviation measure expresses the degree of dispersion of a dataset it indicates uniformity since software has different structures and complexities the time does not fully reflect their capabilities but it could give an idea of responsetime in real scenarioswe realized that the system enhances its performance over the executions cycles the cognitive model was built using cuttingedge technologies with hardware optimization builtin a hypothesis for performance increase relies on resources management of frameworks and thirdparty libraries from the server perspective we measured the execution time of the previous test in an accumulative view fig  as wellthe following section presents the output from the experiment execution we decided to use the decision tree due to the classificatory behavior when compared with other models the decision tree implemented was j builtin by the weka project librariesthe model that is shown here was generated after a manual conversion of the full dataset from csv to arff file format a common weka extension some instances were lost due to data missing in our original dataset the systems output presents the trees predictive performance using crossvalidation with  folds we obtained only  of the instances  out of  have been misclassifiedwe did not focus on looking into the kappa results there are questionable studies related to kappa applications in healthcare due to the lenience of acceptable scores and there is a huge importance of reliability and confidence on the dataset to any potential use in the healthcare industry cohens kappa is like pearson correlation coefficient but it is good for interrater across multiple data collectors or intrarater reliability across multiple data collectors reliability testing being values close to  low and  perfect score mchugh  our data collection is not a huge database so it might be the most suitable for kappa model and it confirms our decision the next metric was a mean absolute error a comparison of predicted versus observed that indicated a low average of errorsthe relative absolute error rrse value of  is a good value of the model but it still may have some opportunities to enhance as classification is a method of supervised machine learning and our intention of application in the healthcare spacethe roc is a strong measure to evaluate the performance of binary classifiers in our case the highest value of  it might means that saito rehmsmeier  the dataset is not either big enough or does not have a significant sample of each class we achieved a value similar of someone tossing a coin or  of chances of true positive resultthe following figure presents the confusion matrix tool to visually analyze the performance of the prediction model see fig  where we also could see  instances of classes normal borderline moderate mci moderatelysevere severe and verysevimpairment or eol the normal class has been assigned to  and borderline has been assigned to  there is a concentration of values in these classesthe last output of our lab was the decision tree we got the splits based on the database processed the first split was on the group column and then at the second level the splits were on the number of visits so on see fig  in the tree structure the class label that has been assigned to a leaf followed by the number of instances that reach that leaf being the value visually slashed the left part represents correctly classified and right incorrectly instancesthe figure below shows a sample of how the tree works the leaf normal was cropped from figure  indicating  true positive classifications and just  classification incorrectdiscussionthe laboratory environment has a lot of limitations when compared with the real scenario and its complexities we made up that a cognitive agent should potentially interact with pwd and herhis caregiver and it could be able to ingest a diversity of environmental variables and patients data extract from symptoms like memory loss abnormal conditions etc then learn from it process it to provide assistive information to the caregivers decision based on a reliable source thus the experiment was considered successful given its restrictions and resources available it is not an easy task to build a healthcare system it must comply with international standards and it should have low lenience of failures our context of dementia care has additional challenges to deal with such as thinking or memory loss or targeting the indirect enduser the target users are informal careswe obtained results from our dataset however we also noticed a lack of instances and varied variables to enhance our machine learning model the oasis dataset has a very clear proposal an open database aimed to support neuroscience research but we realized that data from other sources such as laboratory analyses or physiological signals would be worth if it is integrated into oasis data to more robust solutions to people with cognitive impairmentsanother perspective for our discussion is the tlr score considering that this metric was created by nasa agency to evaluate the hardware mature level for a space mission we attempted to measure our system and we obtained the value  which means meet the statement analytical and experimental critical function andor characteristic proofofconcept to achieve a stage demonstration in real care facilities as suggested by tlr scale we should get the seventh score but it must be a more complex experiment out of the proposed scope of our current laboratorylastly this research has been reviewed by external experts who brought insights and potential enhancements the selection of them was performed through the existing network in the first interview a neurologist brought a few considerations for adding a feature of the patients profile with basic and emergency information it might support the pwd in case of recent memory loss or complete disorientation he also argued about new potential use cases detailed more deeply in section  and chapter conclusioncontributionsas technology is a fastevolving area in terms of innovation our application of a cognitive system to support dementia care might contribute to future research on a novel multidisciplinary area as we could not find similar results we have identified potential directions for future research to explore these further to better understand the potential contributions we did an open interview with experts who shared their thoughts about the real application of this dissertationthe electronic health record ehr is a standard tool used by the medical community to manage patient data it is not a system for caregivers but i believe that the cognitive model might be interesting to create friendly interfaces to provide simple clear and reliable information to nonprofessional people with the role of care it can be a kind of translator of technical terms even though cognitive impairment the patient with dementia can also use the system to eventually remember hisher basic information such as a home address emergency phone number etc in case of memory orientation need i see contributions to the patientfamilies or the caregivers with less formal instructions in daily basis decisionmaking it can be named as a patients dashboard with clinical information a single place to query search and manage the care data the model can also in future bring insights to caregiver of people with dementia that their diagnosis may has changed over time  interviewee ait seems an interesting system i think you can apply the system to support the elderly people too the system proposed can also contribute providing information to healthy people aiming to reduce risk factors of dementia but it requires a careful evaluation with all those involved to address the proposed objective  interviewee bas a future development of the work the inclusion of gene data obtained through genetic panels may be important to be evaluated since certain variants found in the genes may indicate dementia propensity and be an early warning sign currently genetic information is something very restricted to nonspecialists and may not be so accessible to lowincome people but in certain cases it is already carried out via the insurance coverage so the inclusion of this genetic information would facilitate clinical management and access to the datait is important to point out that there is a need for clinical support to transmit the information of the report since reports that have some type of pathogenic variants precision of a more directed medical analysis together with the necessary guidelines and their possible impacts therefore it is important that this critical analysis carried out by the physician is carried out before the inclusion of genetic information in the system in interviewee cs view a specialist physician should manage and be the primary communicator of genetic test results which can help with diagnostic accuracy identification of early symptoms or decrease risk factors for dementiashe adds that the system can also request additional information for each patient to help the doctor in the treatment and diagnosis in addition to providing an interface accessible to the caregiver  interviewee coverall the system has informative behavior we believe that it might relief the caregiver burden in decision making the good decisions are based on reliable available information reliability is a concern in our proposed model we got data from wellknown sources for our lab tests but we should refine the system accuracy with professionals and add a diverse database additionally we believe in contributions to build cheap systems that might be embedded regardless of device screen it only requires internetaccess with no licensing model it is available as an opensource license to encourage further developments we were aiming to create assets to potentially assist informal caregivers of pwd but we also contributed to the cognitive science applications in health care and maybe in further developments of a cognitive architecture to dementia care systemssocial applicabilitythe proposed system has an innovative characteristic due to the merging of cognitive science and artificial agents areas tailored to assist caregivers of people with dementia it might be an affordable tool to caregivers in low and middlecountries due to the low resources needed to use it and it was designed to have a simple user interface with low digital education or illiteracy people as well in other hand it is important to consider that a magnetic resonance might not be available everywhere due to its costs but others data sources can be evaluated in future developments of our experiment to address this issuethe internet is a great source of information to uncountable matters but it needs attention and moderation of all information available for example we might find online screenings promising a selfdiagnosis of cognitive impairment without deep validation of experts and academic researchers with that concern in mind we built a model based on reliable content from experts and institutions to moderate our algorithms knowledge there is a lack of preparedness in caregivers and almost  of dementia cases are not diagnoses in timely manner we believe that our system can support this challenge as part of its roadmapwe also asked experts their opinion on social applications in an open interview both doctors agreed in social applicability of the systems features to care for patients as well as caregivers of people with dementia in nonhospital settings it means a potential optimization of public healthcare resources usage using the technology developed in this dissertation might improve the quality of life of caregivers and people with dementia besides assisting their decisionsfuture perspectiveswe decided to propose a novel tool within the dissertation scope we hope with this paperworks results encourage the development of concrete assets future democratized technologies affordable and available worldwide to assist every person part of a supportive community of people living with dementia our approach is not replacing either humans or healthcare professionals instead we aimed to design a cognitive system with potential behavior to support the diagnostic process detecting unknown warning signs in several knowledge domains as well as provide a framework to understanding the early symptoms by machine learning techniques support patients and relatives ones lack of disease awareness with scientific and not commercial oriented intentions once the internet has become a rich source of information but it might spread misinformation and in some case even replace the correct examination by professional that said we thought as future enhanced algorithms tailored for each patient situation and gather more insights from sources such as physiological signals speech anomalies detection laboratory testing and magnetic resonances to enhance the system and maybe add features to trigger signals of early dementia disease lastly we have got a vision to design a mobile application as the primary interface of components developed in this workinterview a  neurologist and msc

RINWR_4_For_Sage_input.json,Thesis_Dissertation,9282,7, 130,8,1,The 🤷‍♂️,intermezzo  signposts and speed bumpsin a thousand plateaus deleuze and guattari explainwe are writing this book as a rhizome it is composed of plateaus we have given it a circular form but only for laughs each morning we would wake up and each of us would ask himself what plateau he was going to tackle writing five lines here ten there we had hallucinatory experiences we watched lines leave one plateau and proceed to another like columns of tiny ants we made circles of convergence each plateau can be read starting anywhere and can be related to any other plateau  p it is unlikely that deleuze or guattari could have foreseen the current state of technology or the extent to which their work would be adopted there is possibility for continuous rewriting extraction recomposition and reassembly of the materials because of their richness as if vaults of surplus value awaiting future application when deleuze and guattari proposed that a reader could start a thousand plateaus  from any point at all inside the book it would have seemed provocative today a reader may well be seen as starting everywhere without a single commencing point such that all media content across all screens audio and haptic channels are a single hypertextual cocomposition so seriously taken are these technological coreadings and

of the dissertation starting with the open book as described in chapter one matthew goulish tells the reader about discovering the klee painting on the album cover of bartoks concerto conducted by zubin mehta as goulish points out it doesnt matter what it looked like p  he is i believe encouraging the reader not to fixate on the image but rather the flight made possible in its discoveryduring my investigation i was particularly interested in tamara trodds description of klees drawings specifically her discussion of the sketches that klee archived and anarchived in the production of new works i used klee conceptually the texture of the paper size and weight of the brayers and the manipulation of inks thickness were central to the compositions and were literal experiments to examine remix and mashup matters of heterogeneity mimesis and duplication i used line vectors as a riff on mechanical tracing and sampled small bits of colour and image data to use with paint brushes much like musicians do with loops and music samples additionally i conducted a detailed experiment on contingent production which falls outside the scope of the dissertation but is inextricably linked to the topic of production of the new it is centered around envelopes packets of sensation and transversality the curricular potentials seem promisingbertelsen and murphie explainrefrains may sometimes be drawn from the discursive but they break up the logic of discursive frameworks at first in an imperceptible fragmenting of frameworks via affective intensity this affective intensity is capable of

processchapter  machinic artsbased researchintroduction to machinic artsbased researchmachinic artsbased research posthumanizing approaches to art inquiry  concludes the series of documents generated with shannon the first section of the article is a rough conceptual mapping of machinic artsbased research mabr and the second is an overview of the published materials from the past it was surprising to me that the conceptual mapping of mabrs does not once mention mcluhan as shannon notes in her introduction the article is informed by curriculum theorists jan jagodzinski jagodzinski  wallin    and jason wallin     jagodzinski  wallin  i would add that mabr is first and foremost an affirmation of and commitment to aesthetic production as a means by which to disrupt humanism and anthropocentrism in reviewing our past experiments with riff and laying out a trajectory for mabr it seemed as if we were moving from one beta strategy to another one with broader collective and political

applying ontological focus through riffological measures p  we meant it quite literally as we revisit the materials ourselves and are subject to continuous revisiting by othersthough guattari had no inkling about the future of search algorithms there is a resonance between the complex technological compositions resulting from mashup and an appreciation of hypercomplex refrains with hypercomplex problematics a p  hypercomplex refrains sometimes transport one to an abstract interior world into the incorporeal universes of music or mathematics perhaps guattari a p  despite being intimately dependent upon these humannonhuman data relationshipsfor publication counts income and career advancementmany scholars seem indifferent or quick to dismiss these data relationships as irrelevant or of little concern in this age of the cognitariate the conditions that made this article go viral ought to be on the discussion list of every graduate research courseintermezzo  cartographiesmashup the

describes how different materials can be combined to create new forms of artistic expression through the collaborative process shannon and i wondered whether such principles could be applied to academic research and publication and we imagined a continuous process of gathering new fragments that could be assembled into new artistic expressionrock and river cooperate in a recombinatorial process that involves erosion and sedimentation followed by subsequent reconstitution and cementation which is then repeated in a continuous process in simpler terms delanda explains it as followsa rock like limestone or sandstone for example is first articulated through a process of sedimentation the slow gathering and sorting of pebbles that are the component parts of the rock then it is articulated a second time as the accumulated sediment is glued together by a process of cementation quoted in dolphijn  van der tuin  p a more technical definition is found here in deleuze and guattaris theorizing of double articulation in a thousand plateaus geology of morals the first articulation chooses or deducts from unstable particleflows metastable molecular or quasimolecular units substances upon which it imposes a statistical order of connections and successions forms the second articulation establishes functional compact stable structures forms and constructs the molar compounds in which these structures are simultaneously actualized substances  pp the term turntablist is widely attributed to dj babu of the beat junkies who said my definition of a turntablist is a person who uses the turntables not to play music but to manipulate sound and create music gragg  the famous singersongwritermusician mark ronson explains that mashups and other remixed cultural materials cannot be broken down into their constituent parts or into their methods of reconstitution  taking aim at the pastiche ronson explains that vanilla ices rob van winkle ice ice baby  takes queen and david bowies under pressure  and simply puts rap lyrics overtop the musical hooks taking advantage of the familiarity of the original with new twists to make it marketable these records dont really age that well you dont hear them now because they borrowed from an era that was too steeped in its own connotation you cant just hijack nostalgia wholesale it leaves the listener feeling sickly ronson  most would say that van winkle is qualitatively different from more highly respected slick rick grandmaster flash or public enemy despite each using some of the same sampling cut scratch and mashup technologies are these simply matters of personal preference and musical taste ronson describes a collective consciousness of pop music  whereby some music becomes part of the nervous system of a culture with elements that are appropriated and recycled sometimes across generations of musicians the composers are in an aesthetic relationship which is not only technical but bound to the social conditions of the times these similar concerns become central to the academic and curricular work described throughout this dissertationjay hammonds essay mattering black life time the rhizome and a gullahgeechee politics of rhythm  is based on a number of interviews with performer and scholar david pleasant whose field of expertise is the music and culture of the gullahgeechee described as the unique african american inhabitants of the sea islands a mile area of barrier islands off the coast of georgia and south carolina manigaultbryant  pleasant states of the gullahgeechee its musical traditions such as the ring shout the juba and the african american spiritual hold profound and lasting importance for any consideration of the artistic political and social import of black music in the united states hammond  p hammond starts his article with a quote from pleasant describing the contrast between meter as a measure of time versus that of rhythm explaining that meter can have rhythm in it but groove is the real danger groove placates locks in rhythm liberates unlocks groove is so comfortable it can make you believe a lie pleasant  it is striking how similar this claim is with the description of a cliche image described by deleuze  p  groove then is another limiting tool in musics production capabilityin the music of the gullah rhythms that go with one another even in contrasting ways are seen as complementary rhythms are not against one another gullah children are particularly adept at singing one rhythmmelody clapping another and foot patting separate leftand rightfoot rhythms this polydexterity comes from a culture in which present tense is key the language does not distinguish between tense or gender this everpresent consciousness which in black english is seen as it just bes that way speaks to a polyrhythmic and polymetric sensibility one in which time ancestors nature god and being morphed into what can best be described as chord rhythm pleasant  nppolyrhythms and syncopations are collective musical experiences that do not attempt to solve chaotic situations but rather allow for their expressivity in the context of the chaos of these times there are many themes that are relevant for artsbased researchers who are developing innovative ways of attempting to break the habits of the past as pleasant explainsthe linearprogressive linearsequential quality of modern western sensibility falls short of acknowledging the richness of that consciousness rhythmic density complexity and order in these forms would most often be viewed as superfluous extraneous or busy to a modern ear the quality of those forms is lost in western hegemonic presuppositions that limit the motion of nonsequential nonlinearprogressive resources  npthe explanation provided by guattari helps explain how metrics clock time differ from rhythmfrom this perspective universal time appears to be no more than a hypothetical projection a time of generalised equivalence a flattened capitalistic time what is important are these partial modules of temporalisation operating in diverse domains biological ethological sociocultural machinic cosmic and out of which complex refrains constitute highly relative existential synchronies  p the rhythm of our lives is no longer natural or festive it is no longer the birds song that wakes us up in the morning but the bakers motorcycle the syncopated rhythms of machine levers of motor pistons and of typewriters keys mark our life we no longer wait for the feast of the new moon but for the due date of the credit loan our rhythm is profane and tends to dilute itself flusser  p flusser compares humans social rituals moon cycles bird songs and machines to explain the rhythm of life he explains that rhythm obeys certain cyclical rules imposed by the circumstance in which we find ourselves p  he speaks of rhythms of going to sleep and waking up of sowing and harvesting of youth and old age of birth and death  p  it is in his writing about music that flusser best articulates a position on representation which resonates with the writing of this dissertation demonstrated when he clarifies that in it we are freed from the illusion of representation and of all figurativism music simply is and represents nothing  p rhythms of all kinds govern our physical movements and there seems to be an ability to link conscious memory with rhythmic activity such as skipping rope with schoolyard songs the predictability of television commercials their slightly higher volume and easily recited jingles were many of the comforts craved as children when the classroom bell rang we responded in a startled manner which later affected how we reacted to the sirens of firefighter ambulance and police vehicles these experiences have conditioned and colonized our bodies because of participation in all these social psychological and physical environmentscapitalism puts on par the thrilling rhythms of life with the metrics of payment due dates homogenized simple tempos make it comfortable to stay in the ruttedgroove and anticipation is formed around the expectation that the next beat is the same as the one prior a process that centers on compliance and conformity when pleasant speaks of syncopation and polyrhythm it is another way to conceptualize the micro revolutionary potentials of complex aesthetic and ethical refrainsritornellossome of the terms in this intermezzo are borrowed from david coles more poetic description of guattaris constellations of aesthetic refrains  p  which cole designates as the rhythmic insistence of waking dreams thus capturing the lyrical musical percussive and multisensory nature of the type of play that informs my curiositieschapter  anthropocenes projectionsintroduction anthropocenes projectionstreachery in imagesgreen colored vegetation covers a roadside pullout where the treeline opens into a neat rectangular shape without a conscious thought my brain assembles the near perfect shape of the clearing and surrounding trees into the familiar image of a soccer field and when the seasons and colours change it is easy to confuse the space with that of a construction site breaking ground as i visualize the world i am surrounded by familiar and clich thoughtimages in an environment where every clearing is momentarily regarded as a potential development site and when subjectivities form around these perceptions how likely is it that other capacities or applications will be considered gregory bateson explains that we create the world that we perceive not because there is no reality outside our heads  but because we select and edit the reality we see to conform to our beliefs about what sort of world we live in  p in this way the grassy field exists in my mind as a visualized construction carrying whatever meaning attached to it yet it properly exists in the real world independent of my perception the ecology of the mind is inextricably linked to that of the social and environmental stated otherwise guattari says the ecological crises can be traced to a more general crisis of the social political and existential  pp  in guattaris use of the term ecologies three registers are considered the environment social relations and subjectivity  p  they are often called the mental social and environmental ecologies  p  and together irreducibly they constitute a broader approach to earthly matters that guattari refers to as ecosophy    distress in one register will affect all othersenvironmental impacts are often treated symptomatically and from neoliberal perspectives attempts at remediation are delivered within the same conventional socioeconomic framework under which they originated the damage of clearcutting forests in british columbia results in interventions that introduce fastgrowing species that are less resistant to fire and pests daniels  and these marketdriven interventions negatively impact multiple ecological systems daniels brooks et al  guattari explainsthe only true response to the ecological crisis is on a global scale provided that it brings about an authentic political social and cultural revolution reshaping the objectives of the production of both material and immaterial assets therefore this revolution must not be exclusively concerned with visible relations of force on a grand scale but will also take into account molecular domains of sensibility intelligence and desire  p throughout this dissertation we speak broadly about the relationships between art and the visible world and here i underscore that in this regard poetry music the plastic arts the cinemaparticularly in their performance or performative modalities which have an important role to play with their specific contribution and as a paradigm of reference in new social and analytic practices guattari  p intermezzo  in formationa bird in flight has no idea of the shape of its flock says berardi and geraci  p  yet the bird and the flock persist continuously in a state of territorialization and deterritorialization members join and leave wind patterns shift and obstacles are maneuvered the formation is in motion it is motion research doesnt merely represent information returning constantly to the same supposedly foundational structures the same archetypes  but rather compositions of the unconscious contingent topographies evolving with social formations technologies arts sciences etc guattari  p  lines of flight deleuze  guattari  arent defined by the movement from point to point nor are they simply moving in waves the idea of a flock emerges from creatures that are completely unaware of their collective form of its size and formation a bird that joins a flock is blind to the grace and cohesiveness of the geometries of flight berardi  geraci  p  the work of this chapter and dissertation is informationdolleen tisawiiashiimanning describes starlings murmuration from the point of view of her ojibweanishinaabe heritage and the way they interweave intricate cascading flight patterns around land wind and other flock formations without ever colliding  p  she explainsas a cohesion of particularized differences and a correspondent whole of communal indifferentiation this theory of entanglement negates the possibility of any absolute indifference i propose that a kind of autonomy does infiltrate this reality not as a bounded locus of knowledge but as an externally conceived and torn coresponsiveness  p the researchers reflex then is to perceive the world both as internal and external to what is being observed in order to gain an understanding of our human selves a position which is never fully attainable yet there seems to be a tension between the urge to separate from something to study it while on the other hand holding on to the value of the close perspective among the different elements of the flock there are concurrent and mutually dependent physical and mechanical relationships the flocks collective vision and its physical sensation bear little resemblance to that of any individual within the larger body there are relays of intensities and flows controlled for example by wind gravity radiant heat light sounds humidity and electromagnetic energy sight doesnt rely on a specific set of eyeballs attached to discrete individual bodies but rather to a multiplicity of sensations that are open and distributed referring to guattaris description of hypercomplex refrains bertelsen and murphie explainoverall we face a powerful mix of simple sensory problematic and massive affects given some structure in time by simple complex and hypercomplex refrains in varying processes of composition and decomposition these perform a reorganization of sensation and instinct of temporalities of resonances within or across nervous systems involving the likes of globalization neoliberal economics global warming the war on terror mathematics love music

speaking of an american election unsafe students in america and us based educators and researchers in their acceptance notification they provided a brief reminder of their international readership informing us that the effects of the trump era extend well beyond the us borders editor april  obviously written to nudge american contributors to think beyond their bordersshannon and i reviewed the questions posed by the guest editors as well as the language used in the call for papers they asked how do we teach those whose perspectives differ from us ie trumpsters and what are the funds of knowledge of young people in trumster sic families it was clear that they believed this particular student population required specialized handling we wondered why the editors considered almost half of the us electorate marginalized why are teachers educational researchers and journal contributors perceived as necessarily antitrump it appears that even the disparaging use of the term repeatedly written as trumster sic carries such disdain that spelling is of no concern another worry they asked us to lend particular attention to are the kids of those who voted for trump how may educators connect with the children of trumpsters in their classrooms a strange question to ask when most of the students were in attendance the year priora reviewer for jct raised important questions and concerns about the article shady figures  shifting grounds  as for writing style we were told that all of this translates into the fact that so many of the arguments in this paper are simply rhetorical they are not supported by any argument or analysis or any other device to expose them to scrutiny there are no traditional arguments that make objections possiblethe draft needed work but we could see that the reviewer privileged conventional analytical writing that argues a point or attempts to persuade a reader instead of balancing the rhetorics of description and reflection that we used in our work as the reviewer observed the paper ends as something of a cliche among critical scholars having missed the irony when we conclude that we are now simply turning our backs from the issuethe reviewer observed that mcluhans connection to posthumanism is abrupt and historically anachronistic and that there is nothing to suggest that mcluhan would have used the terms in this way mcluhans theory of technology and his description of a global nervous system are the only claims we have made in connection to posthumanism we were told that we use terms like binary humanist and other words that are considered pejorative by recent posthumanist scholars and to justify their use to readers who do not take them to mean anything negative out of hand the reviewer was likely in part correctthe jct article contains some trickery the description of figure and ground is a lighthearted means of describing leftright dualisms and the term surround relates to everything else that remains unconsidered the term surround also picks up on deluezes milieu which as zhang notes is a french term meaning surroundings medium and middle all at once  p  our role here is to play between theorists the technological medium and the process of rendering visiblefigureground analysis is based on mcluhans teachings on perception exemplified by the famous rubin image which shows either an older or younger woman one of which naturally appears in relief no matter which is selected it is materially impossible to be correctits neither a young or old woman it is evident when the paper is flipped over crumpled and thrown awaywhat matters in the call for papers is the contrast between hillary clinton and donald trump as competing images a struggle between good and evil and the meaning of each persons ascentdescent we were interested in the rest of the pictureof which this is merely a part or the surround as we called it mcluhan i argue later is a way of approaching this dilemma as a disjunctivesynthesis shannon and i stated its not that the king is without clothing its that the monarchys textiles are made using exploited labour and the kingdoms cotton is being picked in the plantationocene  p  the reviewer informed us it was a false equivalence which needed to be corrected of course we were pleased that this was recognized yet disappointed again that the irony wasnt appreciatedwhile the article below stands on its own to fully appreciate the seriousplay in its composition i encourage a reader to consider it a direct response to and critique of the guest editors call for papers a reader may also consider this a nod to bill pinars prescient observations from the concepts that once reconceptualized the us fieldpower identity discourseappear to have played themselves out signaled by tendencies toward totalization reductionism and selfreferentiality like the positivism these concepts were intended to replace once again researchers are somehow exempt from their embeddedness in the reality they purport to depict p the article was submitted and published in the reconceptualist journal of curriculum theorizing that owes much to pinar making his quote that much more impactful to use the language of hacking we used mcluhan as a pentest to break in and then it was an exercise in whitehat trickery to get the editors and reviewers to read each and every one of our concerns on a line by line basis and reply to themmassumi in a  essay everywhere you want to be introduction to fear describes the horrific events when on december   a lone gunman entered the

the incommensurability of conventional and postqualitative approaches what reigns is clearly an institutional methodology that is quantitativein braidottis opinion the current epoch is characterized by the crisis of extractionist capitalism which is exacerbated by the rapid development of technology  everything everywhere seems to be in a state of near exhaustion extinction or destruction throughout her career braidotti has observed the tremendous stress educators and activists face especially noting the the manifest fatigue with theory and theorists braidotti  p indeed we the human heirs of western postmodernity are increasingly burnt out and fatigued while they  the technological artefacts we have brought into being  are smarter and more alive than ever  exhaustion and fatigue have become prominent features of the contemporary psychic landscapes exhaustion is witness to the daily and nightly struggles that mark our interaction with the complexities of the present p due to the intensity of technological change during what braidotti calls the fourth industrial revolution  familiar strategies of engagement have been disrupted there is mounting frustration with new theoretical explanations grusin explainsinterrelated critical and theoretical methodologies that have coalesced at the beginning of the twentyfirst century invites the expression of what can only be called turn fatigue the weariness and wariness of describing every new development in the humanities and social sciences as a turn  p ixit seems as if familiar procedures and knowledgesets that once formed the foundation of our professions are being rejected or challenged when the term human is pejorative i believe in humanity means something quite different and at times the disconnect seems unreal guattari explains humanity seems to have lost its head or more precisely its head is no longer functioning with its body how can it find a compass by which to reorient itself within a modernity whose complexity overwhelms it  p kakali bhattacharyas rejecting labels and colonization in exile from postqualitative approaches  is reminder that the best efforts of those engaged in research focused on posthumanism deleuzoguattarian theory and new materialisms need to be attentive and cautious in our efforts shannon and i have been reminded of this in different ways throughout our writing the problem remains that conventional humanist epistemology sometimes seems incommensurable with the new ontological theorizingbhattachary brings this tension to her article as a passionate response

privileging western philosophical discourses that we practice yet another form of epistemic violence towards marginalized communities by ignoring the colonizing knowledgemaking structures these discourses represent she says we did not need to make turns when what is considered new knowledge in the west was part of our heritage ontoepistemologies and considered foundational upon which more complex ideas have been built p as part of her response bhattacharya provides alternative theorists and knowledge keepers that she considers to be valuable alternatives to st pierres bhattacharya themes seem to suggest that mothers elders and cultural rituals remain untapped wells of knowledge thus encouraging researchers to be attentive to the risk of complicity in the erasure of cultural knowledge deleuze may be a way in but he is just one among many in this massive emerging category of scholarship and as bhattacharya explains there are many less eurocentric theorists who engage similar concepts alternatively i contend that this doesnt mean that scholars should reject the innovations that have been labeled as turns clearly postcolonial theory plays an important and often unappreciated role in advancing posthumanist lines of inquiryevidence of the precarious nature of scholarly knowledgework can be seen in the expectations around publishing and the transformation of electronic infrastructure that packages and repackages academic outputs to financially benefit all except those who first generate them i include google scholar microsoft academic researchgate

defining feature in the article posthumanizing mcluhans curriculum we saidwhen mcluhan  posited in  that all technologies are extensions of our physical and nervous systems to increase power and speed p  he understood that humans do not exist independently of their tools mcluhan was suggesting both that there is agency in the technologies used by humans and that humans are merging with their technologies by extending themselves in prostheticity p the technologies of mcluhan are human as are the bodies and nervous systems that they extend and the primary objective of his work is to sharpen senses and train perceptions man is an extension of nature that remakes the nature that makes the man mcluhan  nevitt  p respected deleuze scholar peter zhang has contributed much to this association and has had the additional benefit of a long term writing relationship with marshalls son eric who died in  see zhang and e mcluhan  e mcluhan and zhang    his article deleuzes relay and extension of mcluhan  describes how deleuze actively used mcluhan as a mediator for his philosophical speculation how he picked up a whole volley of mcluhans probes and relaunched them in a new direction p  zhangs article speculates that deleuze like other continental philosophers drew on mcluhans writing to open their own theorizing mcluhan is a good opening and served us wellintermezzo  derailingin the joint article posthumanizing mcluhan  shannon and i saidrailways had once been the circuitry of cities their installation influential in determining the locations of cities their formation central to the amalgamation of towns and their groupings into megalopolises such spatial distribution has similarly influenced the positioning of subway stations beneath cities the physical materiality of cities transportation systems is juxtaposed with information systems travelling at lightning speed these systems the means of its technological conveyance it is in fact locomotives sheer physical mass that has determined the location of train stations requiring their separation at a distance of some three to five kilometres to permit both their acceleration and deceleration p the above seemed like a simple observation when the article was written and i did not realize its broader implications until later we privileged the perspective that technology determined where population clusters emerged and erased by omission that the physical presence of the train was enabled by conditions of european colonialism and that there was a simultaneous process of dispossession and depopulation of existing communities benjamin joseph laffond explains in the survivors speak a report of the truth and reconciliation commissionso we heard a train we heard a whistle and we said and my brother said oh thats the train coming to pick us up pick us up i said okay you know so when the train came they put us on indian agents put us on the rcmp put us on the train told us to sit over here so it doesnt matter so we left from grand narrows every station we stopped at there was children native children that had long hair when i looked out the window and i went wow theres more children going on the train probably theyre going the same way as im going so at that time it didnt matter to me so every station we stopped there was native children girls and boys and there was rcmp and an indian agent lining them up put them on the train put them on the seats  p also from the survivors speak larry beady describes at every stopand and the train ride was okay for the first half hour or so then i realized i was alone my mother was not there and like the rest of the children there was a lot of crying on that train at every stop if you understand the canadian national railway families lived in sections every twenty fifteen miles and children will get on the train and then thered be more crying and everybody started crying all the way to dauphin thats how it was so there was a lot of tears that train i want to call that train of tears and a lot of anger a lot of frustration  p trains then extended the monarchys physical reach and the intensity of the tools of financial exchange legal systems

social and cultural capacities of canadas indigneous communitiesif belowground railway networks are understood as areas occupied by todays hypercity it may also be reasonable to consider them part of a continued posthuman and neocolonial process combined with the insights from bhattacharyas  in the previous intermezzo it is clear that this topic deserves more attention than it received in the

particularly important place in the posthuman era often working at the front lines of ontological becoming no longer just the custodians of the the skills to figure out what the world means the

organic farmers and nuclear scientists alike in the sharing of common purposein intermezzo v derailing i describe the process of derailing as it relates to disjunctive synthesis i describe how it is possible to work together and occupy common strategic purposes with those who occupy different social positions it is at once about transversality but also about technologies of change when it is easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine then end of capitalism there seems to be the need to conceptualize new ways of disrupting power and making space for conceptual collisions i reference the joint writing and the locomotive as an example derailment considers the power it takes to change course the nature of a trains switch compared that of the electric relays of urban busses and my suggestion is that over time agility trumps brute forceit is easy to misunderstand the translated version of guattaris question how do you make a class operate like a work of art  p  as how do you make a classroom operate like a work of art differentiating a classroom as a physical space and the nuances of the word social class is an easy mistake to make work of art most often describes the finished product such as a sculpture or painting but of equal concern is the work that art does and the machinic work that it compels what is the nature of arts work guattari would argue that the work of art is transgressive and subversive making the aesthetic inseparable from the ethicalin childhood relationships develop with caregivers family members other species of animals and organic inorganic matter alike play is learned and much of that activity is creative and artistic all guided by family and educators who remain crucial in introducing children to the conditions of our times genosko explainsguattari once suggested that micropolitical struggle begins in the daycare with infants labouring on games and toys videos gender and race relations hierarchies and codes by means of which they may be translated into the socioeconomic system  p yet play is often seen as a frivolous activity that punctuates the more important work at hand and art is seen as a specialist activity of those with particular skill guattari clarifiesit was only quite late in western history that art detached itself as a specific activity concerned with a particularised axiological reference dance music the elaboration of plastic forms and signs on the body on objects and on the ground were in archaic societies intimately connected with ritual activities and religious representations  p fashioning creative production as it is most celebrated in late stage capitalism may be an irony only appreciated by a people yet to come in the few hundredthousand years of human existence knowledge has only relatively recently been divided into its current disciplines art too is often considered the proper disciplinary work of people with expert skill or training the reign of the discipline is certainly in an awkward process of being resorted and redressedthe crisis of humanism and anthropocentrism require ways to disrupt the cliche snapshots of what the world means requiring that we playout our affairs on the planet differently to play ontologically requires i believe the same commitment that was invested in epistemological terms like situated knowledge and privileged perspectives a war veteran doukahobour grandmother raver someone with severe mental illness all share degrees of ontological diversity a type of machinic capacity that is rendered when occupying radically different realitiesin collective gestures we may join a parade to honor past wars but also as a commitment to a posthuman agency a backyard or communal garden conditions us to a play out new concepts of collective farming and interspecies relating folk music festivals and raves teach us to sensitize to sounds and bodily movements in shared spaces psychiatry is now learning from communities of traditional healers how to use altered states and hallucinogens to strategize new courses of carethe risk of erasure and exclusion is generated when what is considered real and significant is filtered and the creativity and artistry of everyday life is given lesser status the result is that a grandmothers knowledge and her ontological diversity is often considered teaworthy and the artistry of life just artisanalthe anthropocentric view of artistry privileges human creativity as distinct from everything else and is often only considered when anything else is anthropomorphized in this way humans play with humanisms easy differentiation between cartoon animals and dinner humanisms disregard for nonhuman creativity results in a speciesist approach to artistry and on the occasion when nonhuman artistry is considered it presents more like wile e coyote than as parts of complex ecosystemshow we play and with what we play matters children learn both artistic habits and creative skills in contexts that alternately enable or limit encounters with all that is possible playing with difference transversal relationships collective action and selfcare seem to require a radical reinvention of pedagogy and classworki share shannons sentiments when she concludes her dissertation stating humanity lives surrounded by the fruits of its labour in a bed of its making with the systems it values p  yet my agreement is provided with the caveat that the world wasnt made for humans we certainly didnt make it ourselves and long after humans are done the systems of the world will somehow prevail this is in part what guattari asks of us to considerhow do we reinvent social practices that would give back to humanity  a sense of responsibility not only for its own survival but equally for the future of all life on the planet for animal and vegetal species likewise for incorporeal species such as music the arts cinema the relation with time love and compassion for others the feeling of fusion at the heart of the cosmos  pp there is the dual task of reconsidering aesthetic production from beyond humanisms reign and disrupting disciplinaryarts governance over arts work in the first case its a matter of acknowledging the artistry of a world in which we are but part in the second its about fully reinventing our capacity to engage the aesthetic and ethical work we create moving forward i introduce a new concept ontological play a reinvention of artsbased research in the posthuman era

waterdistribution systemsjeongwook choifebruary abstractpostearthquake simulation modelto enhance the resiliency of waterdistribution systemswith the aim to establish preemptive measures to prepare for earthquakes there has been an active global research trend regarding tightened regulations on the seismic design standards of infrastructure facilities such as power utility systems roads bridges and watersupply systems earthquakeresistant design or reinforcement serves as a preventive measure against earthquakes which is essential to reduce seismic damage however considering the nature of such natural disasters and the inevitable consequent damage thereof longterm loss will occur without efficient measures for postevent recovery therefore postevent measures such as quantification of the damage and recovery are also instrumental in terms of seismic responses in this thesis a simulation model that can be utilized for postearthquake restoration measures of the waterdistribution system wds a core infrastructure facility is introduced and described postearthquake restoration measures of the wds can be categorized into two types a shortterm measure of urgent repairs for efficient postevent restoration of water service and a longterm measure for inspection and detection of leaks from the earthquakes in this study we have developed a simulation model which can be utilized to establish shortterm postearthquake restoration measures and to enable numerical studies on seismic damage and postearthquake recovery for wds and the determination of a prompt and efficient strategy for seismic damage recovery through the investigation of various recovery scenarios with different recovery priorities we have also developed a framework and simulation model for the detection of earthquakeinduced leaks at multiple points which can be utilized to establish longterm measures the developed frameworks and models were applied to a realworld wds to verify their performance and the findings of this study are expected to be useful in establishing postearthquake restoration measures for wds or conducting related research in the futureintroductionstudy backgroundinfrastructure refers to the core facilities that serve as the foundation for the sustainable growth and operation of society typically infrastructure systems include watersupply and sewage networks gas and power utilities and road facilities which are mainly public systems essential for human survival and maintaining a functioning society because of the importance of infrastructure a variety of preventive measures against different types of risks are in place with high standards however natural disasters are often beyond human control and the damage is highly unpredictable which leads to difficulties in establishing adequate preventive measures among different types of natural disasters earthquakes have a direct impact on the ground on which infrastructure facilities are built leading to catastrophic damage in both socially and economically which underlines the critical importance of developing adequate measures against the earthquakes in particular in the case of a waterdistribution system wds the extent of damage during an earthquake is particularly devastating and determining the extent of damage is also challenging in practice because most wds structures are buried underground in addition to impacts such as water service suspension and water leakage that may arise from structural damage there may be secondary damage such as chemical contamination in which case significant setbacks can be caused in the water supply of the corresponding area because such disruption in the watersupply service has a direct impact on human survival it is essential to establish adequate preventive and responsive measures against earthquakes in wdssin general methods for reducing seismic damage can be broadly classified into two types the first is reinforcing system durability using preemptive measures to minimize the damage at the time of earthquake occurrence because it is difficult to predict the exact timing of an earthquake event it would be beneficial to develop a robust earthquakeresistant system through preevent reinforcement of the system or implementing a seismic design of the system from the planning stage the second method is to enhance the resiliency of the system by postearthquake restoration in other words this second approach aims to establish efficient recovery strategies according to the specific postevent damage situation and to facilitate adequate allocation of recovery resources to achieve maximum restoration with the highest efficiency because natural disasters are not entirely preventable improving system resiliency in terms of postevent restoration is essential to avoid longterm losses which highlights the significance of reinforcing system resiliency as postevent recovery measures therefore in this study a framework and a model were developed that can be effectively utilized to establish adequate response strategies for postearthquake restoration of wdsseismic damage can occur to various components of the wds such as pipes tanks and pumps in particular much of the damage occurs in the pipes which account for the largest proportion of wds components earthquake damage to pipes typically manifests as breakage and leakage in the pipes when a pipe is broken water flow through the pipe is interrupted and in the case of leakage water leaks through the cracks in the pipe wall or joint that is normal water flow is not possible with a broken pipe but water flow is partially possible through a leaking pipe therefore if a pipeline is broken due to an earthquake it should be repaired with priority because broken pipes cause a critical problem to the water supply in the case of leakage some of the flow characteristics in the system are changed such as the flow rate in the pipe and pressure at the node but because the leakage does not suspend the water supply altogether there are no major service problems even if the leakage is repaired over a relatively long period of time in addition in the case of a burst pipe visual detection is easier because water leaks are exposed to the surface layer whereas the detection and recovery of leaks are more challenging because the damage is not exposed to the surface layer in summary the representative types of seismic damage of wds can be categorized into bursts and leaks the former has a more detrimental effect on the water supply than the latter but its detection is easier whereas the latter has less impact on the service of water supply but its detection is more challenging therefore in this study a simulation model for seismic response of a wds was developed in two types one that is applicable to urgent repairs for the restoration of broken pipes as a shortterm postevent response and the other for the detection of leaks at multiple points applicable as longterm measuresliterature reviewstudies on seismic damage quantification models of wdsthe first step to the recovery of seismic damage of wds is to quantify the seismic damage to determine the extent of the damage and to this end several models for numerical simulation have been developed representative models include  hazus  developed by the federal emergency management agency fema  maeviz  developed at the midamerica earthquake center  graphical iterative response analysis of flow following earthquakes giraffe  developed by shi  and wang   reliability evaluation model for seismic hazard for water supply network revasnet developed by yoo  and yoo et al  and  water network tool for resilience wntr introduced by klise et al a and b hazus and maeviz are models for quantifying the damage caused by disasters using various data inputs such as building groups topographical map location and magnitude of the earthquake and economic data in the target area to estimate the loss from natural disasters such as earthquakes the advantages of hazus are that the model allows estimation of direct damage such as building damage traffic liferelated damage fire collapse of dams and embankments flooding and the consequent casualties as well as estimation of indirect damage such mid to longterm economic loss from the seismic damage the model is also capable of visual representation of the estimated results maeviz is a similar type of disaster analysis model that takes into account the correlation between both power systems and water pipe networks however hazus and maeviz provide only estimates of the overall seismic damage and do not reflect the detailed characteristics and hydraulic conditions of the waterdistribution network wdn to address these limitations giraffe was developed based on the research of wang  shi  shi et al  wang and orourke  bonneau  and bonneau and orourke  giraffe is a model to evaluate a water service networks reliability against earthquake hazards and has distinct advantages from the other models as it allows detailed simulation of hydraulic analysis by classifying the type of breakage according to the type of pipes in simulation of the pipeline breakage however when simulating pipe failure phenomena the model does not consider the demand of nodes decreasing due to pipe failure and is therefore unable to properly address the problem of negative pressure occurring in some of the nodes in the pipeline the revasnet model evaluates the serviceability of wds under seismic damage and an optimal design module is implemented in the model for improved reliability of seismic damage quantification the model is also equipped with a quasipressuredriven analysis quasipda model that can resolve the problem of negative pressure of epanet rossman  the most representative software for hydraulic analysis in addition the model has the advantage of presenting several indexes for evaluation of hydraulic vulnerability eg node serviceability index pipeline risk index system serviceability index that can be utilized to reinforce the wds as a preventive measure against earthquakes finally wntr is the most recently developed model with application of the advanced pda model that allows analysis of abnormal situations such as earthquakes the model was designed to investigate water service availability wsa and recovery time based on earthquake magnitude location and repair strategystudies on reinforcement of postearthquake resilience in wdsdavenport et al  tabucchi et al  and luna et al  published studies related to the reinforcement of postearthquake system resiliency these studies proposed various methods of promptly restoring wds to a normal or close to normal state after an earthquake but did not include any hydraulic analysis modules to for simulation of water supply status in a realworld wdn in the event of a natural disaster in recent years tabucchi et al  presented the first modeling of a series of processes where the system damage was investigated and various types of recovery support staffs were assigned to suspend the water service and repair the system and also evaluated hydraulic performance of a system using a giraffe model the developed model was verified by simulating the  northridge earthquake that occurred in los angeles us the study demonstrated that the sequence and phases of a restoration process from seismic damage can be estimated accurately through modeling but did not attempt to propose and evaluate diverse recovery measuresfurthermore davis et al  davis  and davis and giovinazzi  subdivided the serviceability of wds into several factors such as water delivery quality quantity fire protection and functionality their research showed the quantified recovery phases of each item and analyzed the phases by comparing them with the postearthquake recovery case of wdn in northridge in addition bristow and brumbelow  developed a methodology for vulnerability analysis of wds with various complex disaster scenarios the developed methodology was used to design mitigation measures that can reduce the damage of complex disasters baut et al  developed a framework for scheduling repairs of wds for postdisaster response and recovery services the developed framework uses a multicriteria decision method to assign priorities for the repair sequence of damaged pipes zhang et al  proposed a dynamic optimization framework that uses a genetic algorithm to determine a nearoptimal sequence for postevent recovery work for wds and evaluated resiliency of the system using six different metrics in this study the utility of the proposed optimization framework was demonstrated using a reallife wds with  pipesstudies on leakdetection method for wdsleakdetection methods can be classified into either direct observation or inference methods covas et al  direct observation methods identify the location of the leaks using equipment whereas inference methods detect leaks based on data and computer simulations grunwell and ratcliffe  and muggleton and brennan   conducted research on leak detection using sound equipment to find noise generated by leaking pipes leak noise correlator electronic listening stick ground microphone etc these sounding survey methods can accurately detect leak locations but the detection efficiency depends on the experience and ability of the engineer conducting the detection moreover detection becomes difficult if there is interference from surrounding noise eg sounds generated by traveling vehicles or water used by nearby consumers in addition field and ratcliffe  and farley and trow  proposed leakdetection methods based on gas injection in these gasinjection methods leak locations are determined by injecting gas into a pipe and detecting leaking gas using a gas detector these methods can be effective when the detection area is extensive or when sounding surveys are difficult to conduct however for deeply buried pipes considerable time is required for the gas to reach the gasdetection sensor the abovementioned direct leakdetection methods involve the use of specialized equipment and although the methods enable accurate identification of leak locations they are expensive and require considerable manpower and detection timein recent years there has been active research on leakdetection methods based on data and hydraulic analysis rather than conventional equipmentbased methods poulakis et al  proposed a leakdetection method based on a bayesian system identification methodology the proposed methodology can be used to estimate both locations with highleak probabilities and the leakage volume however the accuracy of the method declines when the leakage volume and model uncertainty exceed a certain threshold ie very small leakage or under high level of uncertainty buchberger and nadimpalli  analyzed flow rate data for a main pipe supplying water to a district metered area dma serving  consumers and proposed a leakdetection algorithm accordingly their method allows leak detection without fieldwork but cannot identify the locations of individual leaks in the corresponding dma misiunas et al  presented a method for detecting leaks or bursts occurring in wdns using the negative pressure wave generated from the leak or rupture location in the pipe this method estimates the leakage volume based on the magnitude of the negative pressure wave from the damaged pipe and identifies the leak location using the wave velocity and travel time this method allows accurate estimation of the location of a leak or burst occurring in a pipe and can be used for leak tracking in a single pipe however there are practical limitations for its application to complicated pipe networks such as large looptype networks additionally aksela et al  proposed a leakdetection methodology based on a selforganizing map som that uses water flow data and mounce et al  proposed another method of leak detection using an artificial neural network ann an aibased technique lijuan et al  developed a method to identify a leak location based on water consumption exceeding the actual demand in this approach the demand of each node is calculated and the difference between the observed and simulated pressures is minimized by applying a genetic algorithm lee et al  and gong et al   investigated leak detection using a transientbased faultdetection method based on the fluid transient wave this technique detects abnormalities in the system by analyzing the pipes transient pressure signal response following an event and is widely used because the method enables searching a wide range of networks in relatively simply and timeefficiently however this approach is sensitive to the system characteristics and requires accurate information on the target system actual network because the pressure signal response depends on the system characteristics in the event of a leakage in the network in a recent study bohorquez et al  proposed a method that combines the transientbased method and ann their approach can identify small leaks with high accuracy however a large dataset is required for ann training and the method has not been verified using measured data or realworld watersupply systems as discussed above there has been continuous research on inference methods for inspection and detection of leaks in wdn but because these methods detect leaks through computerbased data analysis they generally do not consider the field situation making it difficult to apply these methods as they are in the field work in addition most of these methods are designed for detection of a single leak and their effectiveness in detecting the multiple leaks in wdn with unknown quantities and sizes that may be caused by earthquakes has not been verifiedpresent studydissertation outlinethe following three studies were conducted for the work of this phd thesis first a computerbased simulation model was developed capable of performing earthquake simulation on wds and setting various situations of seismic damage to simulate the systems damage recovery next the previously developed simulation model for seismic damage recovery in wds was improved by applying the valvecontrolled segment algorithm and fullpda hydraulic solver the improved model enables more accurate hydraulic analysis of abnormal situations such as seismic damage and facilitates realistic seismic damage quantification by simulating the occurrence of a zone with suspended water service due to the valve shutoff and consequent deterioration of the systems serviceability finally as a longterm recovery strategy for seismic damage in wds a framework and simulation model were developed for the detection of multiple leaks caused by earthquakes the developed framework is a leakdetection method that combines inference methods based on observation data analysis and computer simulation and direct observation methods based on field survey in this way the drawbacks of the conventional leakdetection methods requiring considerable cost manpower and time have been addressed thereby presenting a leakdetection method with excellent field applicabilitydevelopment postearthquake restoration simulation model for wdsin this study a simulation model for numerical analysis was developed for simulation of postearthquake restoration of wds by performing virtual earthquake simulation of the wds and reflecting various seismic damage scenarios the main purpose of the developed model was to derive an efficient systemspecific recovery strategy to enhance the resilience of the damaged wds in terms of postearthquake restoration the model is capable of simulating various seismic damage scenarios and several recovery strategies including the repair sequence rules and crew allocation decisions to present the appropriate recovery schemes for efficient recovery thus the model can serve as a decision support tool prediction of repair completion time estimation of required recovery resources spatiotemporal restoration progress and statistics on repair crew activity for rapid and efficient system remedy in the proposed model to facilitate maximum reflection of reallife situations in the simulation of seismic damage and recovery various options were added in the model including fragility curve of the facility seismic wave attenuation effect of water supply suspension to adjacent consumers in the event of breakage in the pipes first urgent repairs time required for travel for the recovery crew in addition in order to verify the applicability of the developed model in domestic settings the model was applied to a largescale wds currently under operation in south korea and the simulation results were comparatively analyzed to determine the appropriate recovery rules the results of the analysis verified the applicability of the proposed modelfurthermore in this study six recovery rules recovery priority were established for the target wds and sensitivity analysis was performed for the rules and the following conclusions were drawn from the analysis in the recovery process it was most effective in terms of system serviceability to first repair pipes with higher flows regardless of the presence of zoning when the study system was zoned based on the water sources and the repair teams were dispatched based on the preassigned repair zones the most effective restoration result was achieved in terms of reducing the time required for recoverythrough this study it was determined that the most efficient recovery rule for the main recovery strategy for the seismic damage was determined to be appropriately zoning the target wds and prioritizing repairing the pipes with higher flows in the zoneimproving the previously developed seismic damage restoration simulation modelin this study the previously developed simulation model for seismic damage restoration was improved by applying the valve segment algorithm and the fullpda solver in epanet  the improved model enables accurate hydraulic analysis of abnormal situations such as seismic damage by the application of fullpda and allows simulation of the occurrence of zones with suspended water service due to the valve shutoff and consequent deterioration of the systems serviceability in this way more realistic simulation of seismic damage recovery can be performed than by using the existing models in this study the improved model was applied to a realworld wdn and the effect on seismic damage recovery was analyzed according to the distribution of valve installations number and location to this end the distribution of the pipe diameter of the stud wdn was identified and the valve installation target was divided according to the diameter of each major pipe and the valve distribution table  for a total of  cases was established for simulation in addition by establishing the four different seismic damage recovery rules of the wdn table  and analyzing the recovery pattern according to the recovery rules an efficient seismic damage recovery rule for the study wdn was derived the results of the analysis according to the distribution of valve installation cases and recovery rule performed in this study are outlined as follows as the number of valve installations increases it is possible to respond to various seismic damage with a constant recovery efficiency when installing the valve there was no significant difference in the extent of the water service suspension area between the installation of the valves at both ends of the pipeline cases  to  and the installation at the top end case  to  therefore installation of the valve at one end of the pipeline is more efficient in economic terms however the results may vary depending on the location of the study wdn and major facilities on site and the status of damage occurrence valve installation through dividing the target wdn into blocks was also found to be the most efficient method in terms of seismic damage recover considering the cost in terms of the seismic damage recovery rule the segmentbased restoration rules showed higher recovery efficiency than the pipebased restoration rule among the rules the rule that repairs the water service suspension area with priority on the area with a large supply capacity rule  was shown to have the best result in terms of recovery efficiencymultiple leak detection in wds following seismic damagein the event of an earthquake water pipes buried underground are highly vulnerable to bursts or leaks unlike bursts which can be visually examined because the location of the damage is exposed to the surface layer leaks in the pipes are less visible requiring considerable time cost and manpower to discover their locations methods for detecting these leaks can be divided into direct observation methods that utilize detection equipment and inference methods based on observational data analysis and computer simulations the former approach is effective for accurate determination of leak locations but involves considerable time and financial costs whereas the latter involves lower time and financial costs but is less reliable for leak detection in this study the advantages of both methods were combined for improved leak detection efficiency de and reliability and  a numerical model for multipleleak detection leakfinder that employs hydraulic simulation and an optimization technique were developed and  a multipleleak detection framework based on cooperation between analysis and fieldwork teams was proposed the proposed multipleleakdetection method consists of a cascade search performed by the analysis team and an iteration search requiring cooperation between the analysis team and the fieldwork team first the cascade search is performed to locate multiple leaks during the search the number of potential leaks is increased one by one as the search simulation progresses because the actual number of multiple leaks is unknown this search is performed by utilizing the observed data of wds before and after the earthquakes by the analysis team subsequently the iteration search is performed to simulate cooperation between the analysis team and fieldwork team in this process the search efficiency is improved by incorporating the field examination results true detection or false detection in subsequent simulations performed by the analysis team this approach reduces the cascade search space of the optimization method thus increasing de of multipleleak detection in order to investigate the applicability of the developed model multipleleak detection was performed on two smallscale networks with different layouts ie loop and branch type for three formulated cases with different leak locations in each case the simulation results for de and the pattern of detection including search sequences were analyzed the result of analysis showed that the proposed multipleleakdetection method demonstrated consistent performance de regardless of the layouts and leak locations of the applied wdn and the average de was  ranging from  to  these results indicate that the proposed method could identify the locations of all of the multiple leaks occurring in the networks by exploring approximately  of the total pipes in the wdn that is the result confirmed that the proposed method performs more efficient leak detection compared to the conventional methods of leak detectionuniqueness of the studythe unique and distinct contribution of the studies in this thesis are outlined and the results and the verification of the results are also presented derivation of various indicators that can be utilized in seismic damage quantification of wds and comparative analysis of recovery rules simulation of realistic seismic damage situation with application of the valve segment algorithm exploration and determination of efficient recovery rules through sensitivity analysis of recovery efficiency for each recovery rulepriority cascade search algorithm for multipleleak detection development of a framework for cooperation between analysis and fieldwork teamseach of these aspects is described below derivation of various indicators that can be utilized in seismic damage quantification of wds and comparative analysis of recovery rulesin the developed model to qualitatively evaluate the system serviceability according to the wds restoration the serviceability index of the applicable node was calculated using the available supply capacity and the required demand obtained through hydraulic analysis the serviceability index was derived by hour and a system restoration curve was drawn accordingly the system serviceability index area of the restoration curve and the time required for recovery can be utilized as quantitative indicators for comparison and analysis of various recovery schemes in addition it is possible to quantitatively present the most efficient method of system resiliency improvement through sensitivity analysis of these indicators furthermore presenting a graph of the spatiotemporal restoration progress enables spatial analysis such as the location of the seismic damage in the pipeline and facility progress of spatial recovery and hourly identification of vulnerable areas in terms of water serviceability facilitating establishment of more efficient recovery strategies in addition statistical data such as the travel route and distance of repair crew time required for repair completion and the number of repairs per team are presented which can be used for operation planning and allocation of seismic damagerecovery personnel simulation of realistic seismic damage situation with application of the valve segment algorithmrepair and replacement of broken pipes by earthquakes are usually performed after isolating the area from the system by shutting off the valve adjacent to the broken pipe if the water supply area is shut off by a valve for recovery of a broken pipe the water service of not only the applicable area but also the area located downstream of the water flow may also be shut off because the range of the area with water service suspension changes depending on the number and location of valves installed in the network it has a significant impact on the serviceability of the system during the recovery process in the model developed in this study valve segment algorithm is applied for simulation of the seismic damage which allows estimation of areas with direct and indirect water service suspension according to the locations of the broken pipe and the valve as well as more realistic estimation of the system serviceability the proposed model enables more realistic postearthquake simulation based on the installed valves in the event of earthquake in wds under reallife operation the model can also be utilized for valve design and installation planning of the valves that reflect preventive measures against seismic damage exploration and determination of efficient recovery rules through sensitivity analysis of recovery efficiency for each recovery rulepriorityin this study a variety of recovery rules were established that can be considered in the actual field and sensitivity analysis was performed on the recovery efficiency in consideration of the operating conditions of the system zoning valve shutoff etc therefore recovery rules were derived that can demonstrate maximum recovery efficiency in the event of realworld earthquakes in the wds cascade search algorithm for multipleleak detectionin the event of an earthquake if leaks occur in the pipeline at multiple points simultaneously the operator in charge has no information on the number of leaks in the target network because leaks underground that are not exposed to the surface layer cannot be visually confirmed therefore in this study to effectively detect multiple leaks the exact number of and size of the leaks are not known in an actual situation that occur due to largescale natural disasters such as earthquakes a cascade search algorithm was developed and applied in which the number of potential leaks is increased one by one as the search simulation progresses the proposed cascade search method is iteratively performed by increasing the number of potential leaks by one for each iteration until the builtin objective function of the optimization minimizing the error with the observed data after an earthquake is no longer improved development of a framework for cooperation between analysis and fieldwork teamsresearch on the inspection and detection of leaks in wdns using inference methods has been ongoing but because these prior studies are based on leakdetection methods using computerbased data analysis they generally do not consider the field situation thus limiting the application of conventional methods in the realworld situation in this study a framework for cooperation between analysis team and fieldwork team was developed that can improve the efficiency of realworld leakage detection work by applying leakage detection using computerbased data analysis to fieldwork that is the analysis team estimates the pipeline with high possibility of leakage based on hydraulic analysis and optimization techniques using hydraulic measurement information such as node pressure and flow rate and delivers the results to the fieldwork team to conduct field surveys then the result of the field survey was fed back to the analysis team and according to the result of the field survey additional analyses or surveys of the leaking pipes are conducted through the realtime cooperation method the improvement in the de of multiple leaks in the pipelines was achieved the developed multipleleak detection framework was applied to the wdn of a small block scale under actual operation and the efficiency of the multipleleak detection capability of the proposed framework was verifiedconclusions and future worksin this thesis a simulation model that can be effectively utilized for postearthquake restoration of a wds was developed first the simulation model for the seismic damage recovery of a wds one of the developed models in this study is intended for urgent repairs and aims to derive recovery rules to enhance the resiliency of damaged wds by efficiently restoring the pipeline breakage that has a highly detrimental impact on the system through simulation of various virtual scenarios of earthquakes and options of recovery rules repair priorities and crew allocation decisions simulation of areas of water service suspension according to the valve locations and advanced hydraulic analysis fullpda the proposed model can present realistic and efficient recovery schemes of the damaged system in addition using the spatiotemporal graph provided in this model the network recovery progress can be effectively visualized furthermore in the event of an earthquake the predicted area of water service suspension the estimated time of repair completion serviceability for each node and recovery progress over time can be identified thus the model can serve as a decision support tool for operation and design of wdnnext the multipleleakdetection model is a simulation model that can be applied in terms of longterm recovery of seismic damage and can efficiently detect leaks with a relatively small effect on the system but difficulties in detection in particular with the cascade search proposed in this study leaks at multiple points can be effectively detected in the event of a largescale disaster such as an earthquake in addition the framework of cooperation between the analysis team and the fieldwork team of the model is a technique that combines the advantages of direct observation methods and inference methods the proposed framework achieved actual improvement in the leakdetection process cost manpower time etc thus demonstrating its field applicability each model developed in this study effectively depicts the reallife seismic damage and recovery process and thus can be utilized as decisionmaking tools for wds operators engineers and decision makers to provide improved service for water utility consumers in the event of emergency or disasters furthermore the models developed in this study can be further improved and developed through additional research and for this purpose several proposals on the future works are presented belowfuture works consideration of linkage with other lifeline systemsat the present stage the developed model does not take into account other lifeline systems such as road networks and buried gas pipelines so the travel distance and time of the recovery team were simply calculated by assuming a straightline distance between pipelines in addition because there are many underground facilities in other lifeline systems there may be situations that must be considered in the recovery process of wdn but these aspects have not been reflected yet therefore further research is required to integrate with other lifeline systems economic analysis of seismic damage recovery of wdnwhen establishing a seismic damage recovery plan for wds although efficient water supply restoration within the serviceability of the system is critical the budget for implementing the plan is also an important factor even if the recovery rule with the best efficiency for restoration of the serviceability of the system is secured it will not be possible to implement the rule if the relevant department does not have an adequate budget and resources for its implementation therefore a more realistic recovery rule can be established if the analysis of economic feasibility is performed with detailed classification and application of the required resources for seismic damage recovery equipment required for repair work such as cranes and trucks required materials such as pipes for replacement labor costs of restoration personnel etc analysis of various factors affecting leak detectionin this study the applicability of the developed multipleleakdetection technique was verified but the analysis has yet to be performed for various factors that may affect the efficiency of leak detection these factors include the number of sensors the location of the sensors leakage volume number of leaks and error of the measuring instrument if further studies such as sensitivity analysis for the above factors can be performed in the future it is expected that the de of the proposed multipleleakdetection method will be improved

Conclusion Acknowledgments Selected references,universality and individuality of metaphorical conceptualization of time toward effective application of conceptual metaphor theory in language educationyuichiro ogami osaka prefecture universityohsillygmailcom introductionwould it surprise you if i told you that our everyday language was full of metaphors if so see that we devour many books digest various arguments and try to produce new ideas to construct our own theories according to the view of conceptual metaphor theory cmt a theory of metaphors in cognitive semantics these metaphorical expressions are based on the connection between the metaphorical concept and the concept being metaphorized at the cognitive level which means that focusing on metaphorical cognition can be a useful way to understand the meaning and usage of language in this chapter i will show that the idea of cmt which was originally proposed by lakoff and johnson  and sees metaphorical expressions as a reflection of our cognitive capacities can help us to deepen our understanding of the structures of our language and contribute to effective language teaching after providing an overview of the basic tenets of cmt and show its general usefulness in language teaching i will examine the keys to effective language education based on the idea of cmt through a comparative study of spatiotemporal metaphors in english and japanese in conclusion i will argue that for effective language education focusing on metaphors it is important to capture in detail the cognitive system that supports the formation of the structure of metaphorical languages rather than just observing the superficial distribution of metaphorical expressions the basic idea of cmt and its possible effects and considerations on language educationin this section i will introduce the basic tenets of cmt and provide an overview of how our thinking and language are unconsciously influenced by metaphorical thinking to show how it can be effective in language education from a general perspective we will then review the perspectives needed to effectively apply cmt to language teaching the emergence of a conceptual approach to metaphor studymetaphors despite their ubiquity in our language have traditionally been considered a poetic rhetorical or merely decorative use of language and has not been a central topic in linguistics it was a new view of metaphor by lakoff  johnson  which led to a major shift in this cold attitude toward metaphor lakoff and johnson pointed out that metaphor is not just a matter of words but a phenomenon that concerns the very nature of our thought and action they argue that human conceptual system is metaphorically structured and defined and metaphorical expressions are possible precisely because there are metaphors in a persons conceptual system lakoff  johnson  in this view metaphors are seen as essentially cognitive abilities embedded in our minds and linguistic metaphors are seen as being produced on the basis of such metaphorical cognition metaphors as such cognitive abilities are called conceptual metaphors  and each conceptual metaphor is formulated in the capitalized a is b formthree types of conceptual metaphors are proposed structural orientational and ontological first examples of structural metaphor which lakoff and johnson  refer to as one concept is metaphorically structured in terms of another are shown in  examples of structural metaphorsa argument is waryour claims are indispensable  he attacked every weak point in my argument  his criticism was right on the target  i never won an argument with himb time is moneyyou are wasting my time  this gadget saves one hour  the flat tire cost me an hour  i invested a lot of time in her  you need to budget your timec theories are buildingsis the foundation of your theory  we must construct a strong argument for this  so far we have put together only the framework of the theoryin these expressions we do not just discuss a concept in terms of another in a for example argument is metaphorically structured in terms of war here some aspects of the conceptual network of war are used to characterize the concept of an argument in other words the concept of war partially structures what we do in arguing in this metaphor thus in structural metaphors one concept is given a structure using another conceptsecond you will see examples of orientational metaphors in  this metaphor is said to organize a whole system of concepts with respect to one another lakoff  johnson  examples of orientational metaphorsa happy is up sad is downim feeling up  this boosted my spirits  thinking about her always gives me a lift  im feeling down  i fell into a depressionb high status is up low status is downhe had a lofty position  she rises to the top  he is at the peak of his career  he was at the bottom of the social hierarchy  she fell in statusc more is up less is downthe number of books printed each year continues to increase  my income rose last year  his income fell in the last year  if you are too hot the heat is turned downas shown in these examples many of our fundamental concepts such as happiness social position or degree of something are structured by the metaphor of spatialization in a way that preserves their internal systematicity in a for example our feelings are described as up or down because the concepts of up and down orient our concepts of happiness and sad these metaphors are rooted in our physical social and cultural experiencesthird examples of ontological metaphors are presented in  according to lakoff  johnson  metaphors of this type are thought to be ways of viewing events activities emotions ideas etc as entities and substances examples of ontological metaphorsa inflation is an entityinflation lowers the standard of living  if there is much more inflation we will never survive  therefore we must combat inflation  inflation backing us into a cornerb the mind is a machinemy mind is not operating today  i am a little rusty today  we have been working on this problem all day and now we are running out of steamc visual fields are containersthe ship is now coming into view  i have him in sight  hes out of sight now  that is at the center of my field of vision  there is nothing in sightthese metaphors conceptualize abstract entities in terms of our experience of physical objects and substances for example in a the abstract event of rising prices is described as if it were an entity with a concrete form thus we can even categorize things that are not clearly discrete or bounded as concrete objects in a coherent way through ontological metaphors these metaphors often serve as the basis for structural metaphorsas illustrated by the various examples above metaphors give shape to more than a few aspects of our view of the world the linguistic examples shown in  are not special expressions but rather everyday ones none of the metaphors mentioned so far may be taken as intended to be used to describe things figuratively from this fact you will now see how pervasive unintended metaphors are in our everyday language and how ingrained metaphorical cognition is in our thought the important point is that the metaphors presented above are not motivated by the objective resemblance of two things or concepts lakoff and johnson  explain that it is the cooccurrence within our experience that makes these metaphors work there are two types of experiential cooccurrence experiential similarity and experiential correlation in this way in lakoff and johnsons  view the similarity or correlation between two concepts captured or interpreted through our experience is specified as what motivates conceptual metaphors key ideas and developments of cmtthe innovative approach to metaphor by lakoff and johnson  has been developed into a more robust theory through a number of subsequent studies let us now see some of the key concepts that have been presented in the development of cmt to deepen our understanding of this theoryof particular importance in explaining metaphors in cmt is the idea of conceptual mapping which was proposed by lakoff  lakoff proposed that a metaphor is a systematic projection of a conceptual structure from the conceptual domain of what is metaphorical to the conceptual domain of what is being metaphorized the domain that is the starting point for the projection is called the source domain and the domain that is the destination is called the target domain for example in argument is war in a this metaphor is built upon a conceptual mapping from war as the source domain to argument as the target domain as we have seen earlier in this metaphor concepts related to war such as an attack defense and target are systematically projected to structure the concept of argument such crossdomain conceptual correspondences are also observed in other metaphors and it is the structural correlation in our everyday experience that motivates thisin the mapping between concepts involved in the formation of a metaphor not all elements of the source domain are mapped to the target domain and the mapping between concepts in a metaphor is systematic but not necessarily exhaustive in short in a given metaphor elements that are mapped from the source to the target domain are selective what then determines which elements are mapped and which are not in a specific metaphor an important idea in cmt related to this issue is the invariance principle which is described as followsmetaphorical mapping preserves the cognitive topology ie the imageschema structure of the source domain which is consistent with the inherent structure of the target domainlakoff  this principle explains the constraints on mapping between the source and target domains as shown here the conceptual mapping between the two domains is thought to be restricted in a way consistent with the requirements of the target domain this means that elements that do not correspond to the intrinsic properties of the target domain are eliminated in the mapping which is called targetdomain overrides the image schema an abstract preconceptual cognitive structure that is formed through our recurrent physical experiences and interactions with the environment plays an important role here it is utilized when two different kinds of experiences are conceptually connected to establish a metaphor and considered to support the establishment of metaphorsin this way in cmt metaphors are considered to be crossdomain mappings of concepts motivated by similarities and correlations captured by our subjective experience eventually lakoff and johnson  incorporated the arguments of johnson  and lakoff  gradys  primary metaphor theory and fauconnier and turners  conceptual blending theory to present a more complete view of cmt in terms of embodiment possible effects and considerations of cmt in language educationwe have seen so far that our language contains metaphorical expressions down to the smallest detail that these metaphorical expressions are distributed systematically and that the formation of individual metaphorical expressions and their relationships are supported by metaphorical cognition in light of these facts it is not difficult to understand how conceptual metaphors work can lead to efficient and effective language teaching by understanding the metaphorical system behind metaphorical expressions in a target language we can systematically learn how a specific concept is linguistically realized in that languagethis view is also supported by deignan  who provides a detailed analysis of metaphors from the standpoint of corpus linguistics she describes the potential contribution of cmt to language education as followsperhaps more significant than the creation of individual words and word meaning is the apparent potential of conceptual metaphor theory to reveal systematicity in the lexicon if an underlying conceptual metaphor can be seen to motivate a number of linguistic metaphors it should follow that semantic links are traceable between them we would thus expect many linguistic metaphors to form semantic networks or systems of some kind  such systematicity would mean that conceptual metaphors are a very useful tool for learners of english and other languages because they could illuminate networks of associated figurative meanings giving access to large numbers of frequently used vocabulary itemsdeignan  at the same time however deignan offers a number of important suggestions to the cmt approach in relation to this chapter the most important of these can be found in the following statementthe main challenge to conceptual metaphor theory that arises from this work is the systematicity that it suggests although present for some groups of metaphors it is not found to the degree that is suggested  if our linguistic metaphor systems can be linked to street maps then the corpus data suggest that they are not the logical grid networks of planned modern cities but collections of different sized and merging villages with interconnecting roads perhaps this expresses the underlying conceptual patterns too if metaphorical language is an expression of metaphorical thought then rather than largescale networks covering whole conceptual areas we may operate with much smaller conceptual networks loosely related to each otherdeignan  to summarize cmt may not necessarily detail actual language patterns and thus may not always provide a precise perspective on the systematicity of metaphorsdeignans  suggestion is important for improving the explanatory power of cmt and applying its benefits to language teaching to make effective use of the idea of cmt in language teaching it is essential to precisely and clearly identify the conceptual mechanisms that govern the formation and systematization of metaphorical expressions in particular we need to be very careful when we find metaphors in the target language that are similar to those found in our own language in such cases we must be strongly aware that we must go beyond the superficial similarities and differences between the two languages to accurately identify the systems that can reasonably explain the realization of metaphorical expressions in each language otherwise when learning different languages there is a risk that learners may overgeneralize the metaphorical system of the target language based on their knowledge of their own language or misunderstand the systematic relationship between the expressions they are learning which may not lead to effective learning however if we are fully aware of this caveat and can overcome the potential challenges to better grasp the cognitive system of metaphors the idea of cmt can be very helpful in teaching and learning different languages on the conceptualization of time in terms of space in english and japaneseas we have seen in the previous section to effectively apply the tenets of cmt to language teaching it is necessary to precisely identify the cognitive systems that rule the overall structure of metaphorical expressions if we succeed in achieving this we can efficiently understand the expansion of lexical meanings and the network of a group of expressions of the language to be learned and facilitate its learning in a positive way to demonstrate this in this section i will conduct a case study on english and japanese spatiotemporal metaphors in which concepts about time are represented through languages about space universality and individuality of the connection between the concepts of time and spacetime a concept essential to human life is interestingly often stated in metaphorical languages among them expressions describing the meaning of time using words related to space are observed in languages around the worldtemporal metaphors in terms of space have been vigorously studied especially in the fields of cognitive linguistics and related fields the results of such studies have shown that we can find similar expressions of spatiotemporal metaphors even between completely different languages such as english and japanese it is surprising that these two historically unrelated languages can express an abstract concept of time in a similar way from this fact one might think that english and japanese share the same manner of conceptualizing time and if so japanese speakers can understand and appropriately use english spatiotemporal metaphors by using their knowledge of those in japanese as a matter of fact however it is not reasonable to think in such a simple way a closer look at spatiotemporal metaphors in english and japanese reveals some small but unmissable differences between the two which cannot be explained by considering that the same spacetotime mapping is shared between the two languageson what conceptual bases are english and japanese spatiotemporal metaphors founded to answer this question we will explore how time is conceptualized in terms of space in english and japanese by looking in detail at temporal expressions in terms of space in the two languages spatiotemporal metaphors in english and their conceptual foundationsin this subsection we will look at cmts view of the expressions and classifications of spatiotemporal metaphors in englishlakoff and johnson  first drew much attention to the problem of metaphorizing time from a cognitive perspective they introduced expressions that describe the passage of time in the form of a statement that time is moving toward us as in  as an instance of the time is a moving object metaphor and expressions that describe the passage of time in the form of a statement that we move through time as in  as an instance of the time is stationary and we move through it metaphor timeis moving objectthe time will come whenthe time has long since gone whenthe time for action has arrived time is stationary and we move through itas we go through the yearsas we go further into the swere approaching the end of the yearboth of these metaphors were explained to be subcases of the time passes us metaphor and were based on the idea that the future is ahead of us and the past is behind uslakoff and johnsons  model was later elaborated in lakoff  johnson  where the two types of spatiotemporal metaphors were classified into the moving time metaphor as shown in  and the moving observer metaphor as shown in  moving timea christmas is comingb the deadline is approachingc in the weeks following next tuesday  moving observera we are coming up on christmasb we passed the deadlinec were halfway through septemberthese two metaphors were considered subtypes of the time is motion metaphor in which the observer of the temporal situation is thought to be at the present the future in the front and the past behind from this perspective lakoff and johnson  pointed out that moving time and moving observers are in a figureground reversal relationshipthe two metaphors are strictly speaking inconsistent with each other in one times are objects that move past a stationary observer in the other times are locations in a landscape over which an observer moves in short they are figureground reversals of one anotherlakoff  johnson  in this view time is regarded as figure and the observer as ground in  while the observer is regarded as figure and time as ground in  thus a reversible pair of spatiotemporal metaphors moving time and moving observer were assumed herethe model of spatiotemporal metaphors based on the ideas of lakoff and johnson has been widely accepted and referred to in many studies a series of discussions by moore       has propelled this into an even more compelling theory according to moore  the expressions that lakoff and johnson  classify as examples of moving time actually fall into two different metaphors to see moores point let us look at examples  and  i hope we get a chance to meet in the coming weeks i hope we get a chance to meet in the following weeksmoore  these two sentences are both considered examples of moving time in the framework of lakoff  johnson  however in  the future point of time is indicated in relation to the speakers present whereas in  the future point of time is indicated through the frontback relation between the two points of time in short while come in  expresses the future deictically follow in  is thought to express the future objectively through the relationship between a point in time and another point in time regardless of deixis from this perspective moore  argued that it is necessary to distinguish between these two types of metaphor moore refers to the former as egocentered moving time and the latter as frontback moving time and points out that figureground reversal does not occur in frontback moving timethe analysis presented here shows that frontback moving time is not a figureground reversal of moving ego because the two metaphors involve different kinds of sourcedomain relations in frontback moving time the relationship is between two moving things in moving ego the relation is between a mover and a locationmoore  the frontback moving time has been called sequence is relative position on a path since moore  and at present moore  classifies english spatiotemporal metaphors into three types as follows  moving egoa we are approaching christmasb we have arrived at the end of summerc we have passed the deadlined we will be busy in the weeks ahead egocentered movement timea christmas is approachingb summer has arrivedc the deadline has passedd summer has come sequence is relative position of a patha the weeks ahead of christmas will be busyb new years follows christmasthus moore revisited lakoff and johnsons twoclassification model of spatiotemporal metaphors and proposed a more plausible threeclassification model this chapter adopts moores model as a valid model of spatiotemporal metaphors in english spatiotemporal metaphors in japanese and their conceptual foundationshaving seen the cmts view of spatiotemporal metaphors in english let us now examine the case in japanese in this subsection expressions of spatiotemporal metaphors in japanese and their puzzling aspectsas briefly mentioned earlier there are not a few expressions in japanese that apparently correspond to english spatiotemporal metaphors indeed the english temporal expressions shown in  can be translated into japanese sentences that represent almost the same meanings in the following examples  correspond to   to  and  to  respectively a watashitachi wa  kurisumasu  ni    chikazuitekitawe          top  christmas   loc  approachcomepstb watashitachi wa  natsu     no    owari  ni     itattawe          top  summer   gen  end    loc  arrivepstc watashitachi wa   shimekiri

can find similarities between expressions of spatiotemporal metaphors in english and japanesein light of this fact one might think that the same spacetotime conceptual mapping is established in japanese as in english however it is premature to assume that english and japanese spatiotemporal metaphors are parallel to this fact as one of the problems let us turn our attention to temporal expressions with the japanese verb kuru which corresponds to come in english now consider the following examples a mousugu  natsu    ga     kurusoon      summer  nom  comesummer will soon comeb natsu    ga    kitasummer  nom  comepstsummer has come a watashitachi wa  natsu    ni    kiteiruwe          top  summer  loc  comeprfb watashitachi wa   natsu    ni    kitawe          top  summer  loc  comepst natsu    ga     kiteirusummer  nom  comeprogas shown in  kuru can represent temporal meanings as same in the case in come however as shown in  it cannot be used in moving egotype expressions to describe the passage of time cf shinohara  in addition as shown in  the verb cannot be used in egocentered moving timetype expressions to represent the passage of time in english any expression in the form corresponding to the japanese expressions in  can appropriately be used to express the meaning of time a summer will soon comeb summer has come a we are coming to summera we are coming up on christmasb we have come to summer summer is comingalthough the moving egotype expressions using come such as shown in  might be less typical the following examples show that they can be appropriate as temporal expressions a because we are coming to the season when many feel like entertaining i thought i would talk about progressive dinners

time and can be used in moving egotype expressions kuru does not allow this this shows that the japanese verb kuru is more restricted in its use in temporal expressions than english comealthough the difference between come and kuru may seem like a small difference this gap raises a question because in japanese kuru the figureground reversal of egocentered moving time and moving ego is not established this suggests that japanese spatiotemporal metaphors may in fact be based on a different mechanism from that of english with this in mind in the following subsections i will revisit the cognitive bases of spatiotemporal metaphors in japanese here i will focus my discussion on moving egotype and egocentered moving timetype expressions is time actually moving in japanesein this subsection i will show that japanese expressions taking the form of egocentered moving time are not actually based on the motion of time but are expressions based on fictively invoked motion in our mental view fieldlet us first see that in japanese we need to distinguish between temporal expressions with verbs corresponding to approach and those with verbs corresponding to come in english as we have seen in  in english both approach and come are used to describe moving ego and egocentered moving time and figureground reversal is established between the two types of expressions moving egoa we are approaching christmasb we are coming to summerb we are coming up on christmasc we have come to summer egocentered movement timea christmas is approachingb summer is comingc summer has comein contrast the corresponding japanese expressions do not allow this a  watashitachi wa   kurisumasu  ni    chikazuitekitawe          top  christmas   loc  approachcomepstb watashitachi wa  natsu    ni

depicts the motion of ego and the type of expression that depicts the motion of time are both appropriate and there is a figureground reversal between them in contrast in the case of kuru the type of expression that depicts the motion of ego is not appropriate and the inversion between moving egotype and egocentered moving timetype expressions is not possible here this suggests that in japanese spatiotemporal metaphors we should distinguish between expressions with chikazuku and those with kuru as different types while the former represents the approach of time the latter represents the arrival of timenow i would like to focus on the expression of chikazuku which is a type of temporal expression that is thought to represent the approach of time and examine the basis for its formation this type of expression establishes the socalled figureground inversion similar to that of english temporal expressions using approach and come from this fact we may think that the temporal expression by chikazuku appears to be based on the same bases of those of approach and come which is not seem to be true notice here that in moores model a motion event such as that shown in  is assumed to be behind the expressions of egocentered moving time such as a the bus approaches a christmas is approachingin short the motion of an object is considered to be mapped onto a motion of time in the english expressions of egocentered moving time however this does not apply to japanese cases if we take moores view the situation described in  which represents the motion of an object should be assumed to be behind a which seems to represent a passing of time in terms of times approach  basu  ga    chikazuitekurubus   nom  approachcomethe bus is approaching a kurisumasu  ga     chikazuitekuruchristmas   nom  approachcomechristmas is approachinghowever it is doubtful whether the spatial scenario described in  is supposed behind temporal scenarios of the situation described in a in japanese a sentence that expresses an entitys motion toward a speaker can indicate a speaker or the place where the speaker is located as a terminal point as shown in  a basu  ga     watashi  ni    chikazuitekurubus   nom  i        loc  approachcomethe bus is approaching mea basu  ga     watashitachi  ni    chikazuitekurubus   nom  we           loc  approachcomethe bus is approaching uson the

watashitachi  ni     chikazuitekurusummer  nom  we           loc  approachcomeas seen here the speaker is not regarded as a terminal point of moving objects in japanese temporal expressions in question this suggests that time or a temporal event is not in fact a movable object in japanese temporal expressions that apparently describe the motion of time in this regard it is expected that even in english the speaker cannot be indicated as the arrival point in the expression of egocentered moving time however the following examples suggest that such a point is not necessarily valid a

such as march on or proceed which strongly imply its own movement but corresponding expressions are not acceptable in japanese a summer is marching on its holiday time and the garden has been in full

above the type of temporal expression using chikazuku as in a is not considered to be based on the spatial scenario in which some object is moving towards the speaker unlike the english expressions of egocentered moving time with approach and comewhat conceptual structure then motivates japanese temporal expressions in the form of egocentered moving time with chikazuku my view is that this kind of expression is a case of fictive motion langacker  see also matlock  matsumoto  talmy  etc in which an object that is not actually moving is subjectively perceived as moving in support of this view in japanese our motion toward an object is often described as the motion of the object consider the following sentence gakkaikaijou     ga    chikazuitekitaconferencevenue  acc  approachcomepstthe conference venue is approachingin  the conference venue is described as approaching even though it is a static entity obviously what is described as approaching in this sentence does not actually approach the speaker in short a fictively invoked motion of an unmovable object which is caused by the speakers motion is presented here in the same way as temporal expressions such as a and b the speaker cannot be indicated as a terminal point in this type of sentence gakkaikaijou    ga     watashitachi  ni    chikazuitekuruconferencevenue  nom  we           loc  approachcomein addition the motion of a static object cannot be described by verbs that represent the progress of an object a gakkaikaijou    ga    koushinshiteiruconferencevenue  nom  marchprogb gakkaikaijou    ga     susundeiruconferencevenue  nom  proceedprogin this way common grounds are found between sentences such as a and fictive motion expressions in japanesefrom what has been observed i propose that the type of japanese temporal expression in question is based on the virtual motion of some entity captured in our subjective view field which is caused by our motion in short the motion of time in japanese is considered an illusionthis view is further supported by yasunari kawabatas description of the japanese literary work yukiguni the following quotation is from the scene in which a man who is on a train is looking out of the window here we refer to the english translation of edward g seidenstickerkagami no soko ni wa yuugeshiki ga nagareteite tsumari utsuru mono to utsusu kagami to ga eiga no nijuuutsushi no youni ugokuno datta ano yuugeshiki no nagare wa satewa toki no nagare no shouchou deatta kato kare wa futo sonna koto o tsubuyaitayukiguni yasunari kawabataat the depths of the mirror the evening landscape moved by the mirror and the reflected figures such as motion pictures superimposed one on the other he wondered whether the flowing landscape was not perhaps symbolic of the passage of timesnow country translated by edward g seidenstickerin this passage the word mirror indicates the train window and the motion of the landscape is a nonactual motion caused by the motion of the speaker in the train car this virtual motion corresponds to the motion described in a and  this quotation suggests that the type of virtual motion can naturally be associated with the elapse of time in japanese conceptualization of time as a visitor in japanesein the previous subsection we saw that the japanese temporal expression with chikazuku is regarded as an expression of fictive motion in this subsection i will turn to the remaining problem and show that the temporal expression with kuru is based on a conceptualization of time as a visitoras we have observed through examples  and  japanese temporal expressions using kuru cannot represent the gradual passage of time a mousugu natsu ga kurub natsu ga kita natsu ga kiteiruthis phenomenon can be successfully explained by viewing temporal expressions with kuru as a personification of a visitors arrivalnotice here that the verb kuru has two meanings in its spatial uses as shown in examples  and  a eki     no    hou      kara  yuujin  ga    kurustation  gen  direction  from  friend  nom  comea friend of mine is coming from the stationb eki     no    hou      kara  yuujin  ga    kitastation  gen  direction  from  friend  nom  comepsta friend of mine was coming from the station a mousugu  uchi   ni    yuujin  ga     kurusoon      home  loc  friend  nom  comea friend of mine is arriving at my home soonb youyaku  yuujin  ga    kitafinally    friend  nom  comepstfinally a friend of mine has arrived at my homein a and b kuru expresses a situation in which the speakers friend approaches the speaker i will call this use of the verb approaching kuru the sentence of approaching kuru is inverted to expressions with the verb iku corresponding to go in english as shown in  a yuujin  ga    eki     no    hou      ni    ikufriend  nom  station  gen  direction  loc  goa friend of mine is going in the direction of the stationb yuujin  ga    eki      no    hou      ni    ittafriend  nom  station  gen  direction  loc  gopsta friend of mine was going in the direction of the stationin contrast in examples a and b the motion of the speakers friend is not an issue in these sentences kuru indicates only that the friend will soon arrive or appear at the speakers place or that the friend has arrived or appeared in the past i will call this use of the verb arrival kuru unlike in the case of the approaching kuru no inversions can be assumed in sentences with arrival kuru this is because the arrival kuru does not concern the motion of the object from one point to another but only the appearance of the object in a certain placenow let us remember that the passage of time could not be represented by kuru nor could temporal expressions with kuru be inverted into moving egotype expressions taking this into account the temporal expression using kuru is considered to be based on the arrival kuru not the approaching kuru based on this view i propose that the japanese temporal expression using kuru should be regarded as motivated by our experience of the encounter with a visitor rather than the motion of an object this is supported by expressions such as those shown in examples  and  mousugu  yoru   ga    otozurerusoon      night  nom  visitnight is coming soon mousugu  shinnen   o     mukaerusoon      newyear  acc  greetthe new year is coming soonthe verb otozureru in  corresponds to visit in english and mukaeru in  to greet in japanese these verbs are typically used to describe a person visiting somewhere or inviting someone in as shown in  and  which suggests that time is seen as a visitor takusanno  kankoukyaku  ga     kono  machi  o     otozurerumany        tourist        nom  this   city    acc  visita lot of tourist visit this city kono  machi  wa   takusanno  kankoukyaku  o     mukaeruthis   city    top  many       tourist        acc  greetthis city greets a lot of touristsin connection with this view the following examples seem to show that it is conventionally accepted in japanese to regard time as a visitor tsukihi wa hakutai no kakaku nisite ikikau toshi momata tabibito naritime is an eternal traveler and the years passing by are also travelersbasho matsuo oku no hosomichiin  you will find the opening line of a famous japanese classic by basho matsuo a poet of the early edo period here the time is compared to that of a traveler the lyrics in  are from a popular childrens song which speaks of peoples longing for new years the song is calling out to new years come hurry up mou ikutsu neru to oshogatsu  oshogatsu ni wa tako

oshogatsuthe lyrics in  also quoted from a popular childrens song describe the arrival of spring using the verb kuru here the arrival of the spring is described as an encountering spring in various places haru ga kita haru ga kita doko ni kitayama ni kita sato ni kita no ni mo kitaspring has come spring has come where has it beenits come to the mountains the villages and the fieldstatsuyuki takano and haru ga kitaas shown in these the idea of personifying time or temporal situations seems to be deeply rooted in the japanese languagefrom what we have seen so far the japanese temporal expression using kuru along with otozureru and mukaeru is regarded as an embodiment of a personification metaphor that sees time as a visitor by taking this view it is possible to explain why temporal expressions with kuru cannot represent the passage of time the type of expression cannot show the flow of time because it describes the realization of a temporal situation that is captured discontinuously through the changes found in the surrounding environment as the arrival of a visitor it is also not possible to invert it into the moving egotype expression since this type of expression does not concern itself with motion classification of spatiotemporal metaphors in japanesewhen comparing english and japanese we can find similar expressions of spatiotemporal metaphors in these two languages however there are discrepancies in the behavior and distribution of spacetotime expressions in both languages if we overlook these discrepancies and are deceived by the apparent similarities into thinking that english and japanese share the same mode of spatial conceptualization of time we will not be able to explain such inconsistenciesfrom this point of view in this section i have taken a closer look at the expressions of spatiotemporal metaphors in english and japanese and examined the conceptualization systems that govern them as a result we found that the japanese expressions that seem to correspond to the english examples of egocentered moving time are not actually those that view time as a moving object but rather expressions of fictively invoked motion and personified expressions that view time as a visitor by employing this view it is possible to provide a reasonable explanation of the linguistic embodiment of spatiotemporal metaphors and their networks in english and japanesethe findings here will effectively facilitate japanese speakers understanding of english spatiotemporal metaphors or english speakers understanding of japanese spatiotemporal metaphors although we were not able to discuss the examples of moving ego and sequence is relative position on a path here there are interesting differences between english and japanese in the expression of these metaphors cf hirose  shinohara  shinohara  pardeshi  etc further study of these metaphors is expected to yield more important insights into the system of conceptualization of time in english and japanese conclusionin this chapter we have looked at ways to apply the theoretical perspective of conceptual metaphor theory to effective language teaching practices in section  we outline the basic idea of cmt show the contribution it can make to language education and look at what we should pay attention to in this context in light of this in section  through the examination of spatiotemporal metaphors in english and japanese we have shown the necessary perspectives and expected effects of utilizing the findings of cmt in language education as has been shown throughout the discussions here by clarifying the cognitive mechanisms governing the meaning and network of metaphorical expressions in a particular language it is possible to provide a precise nonintuitive explanation of the meaning expressed by metaphors in that language and the overall structure of the metaphors in that language by gaining a clearer perspective on a wider variety of metaphors through such an approach it is possible to deepen our understanding of metaphoric patterns in a language and to apply this knowledge to the understanding and learning of another language although the discussion in this chapter focused on english and japanese the findings here can be applied to the understanding and teaching of any other language the approach of cultural linguistics cf

participation in italythe right of children to participate and the situation in italythe convention on the rights of the child  states in article  the right of children to express their views whenever a decision concerning them has to be taken and that their opinion should be duly taken into consideration consequently the states parties have a clear legal obligation to recognise this right and ensure its implementation by listening to childrens views and giving them due weightthe committee on the rights of the child in the general comment no  the right of the child to be heard  identifies the right of children to express their opinions and be heard as one of the four general principles that constitute the convention on the rights of the child together with the principle of nondiscrimination the right to life and growth and the principle of best interests art  of the document states that the exercise of the childs or childrens right to be heard is a crucial element of participation processes the concept of participation emphasises that including children should not only be a momentary act but the starting point for an intense exchange between children and adults on the development of policies programmes and measures in all relevant contexts of childrens lives p the same right is recognised by article  of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union approved in nice on december   and by the european convention on the exercise of childrens rights of  which in art  disciplines the childs right to be informed and to express his or her views in proceedingshence childrens participation is a right sanctioned by international legislation and by the laws of the states that implemented these conventions such as italyhowever in italy listening to and participation of children in decisionmaking processes seems to be a goal that child protection services have not fully achievedwhile the right to be listened to is guaranteed in formal proceedings before the juvenile court albeit not uniformly throughout the italian territory agia  it seems more challenging the participation of children in the decisionmaking processes managed by child protection services to implement interventions to protect childrenin the report of the italian child ombudsman on the child protection system agia  the ombudsman demands that the juvenile court and the local authorities guarantee the right of minors to be heard both during the investigation phase and following issue of provisions to protect them adequately inform them about the decisions that concern them and ensure their participation in the definition of educational projectsthe committee on the rights of the child in the concluding observations on the combined fifth and sixth periodic reports on italy  in relation to the respect for the views of the minor in point  a recommends to introduce a comprehensive legal provision establishing the right of the child to be heard without any discrimination due to age disability or any other circumstance both in the family environment and in any administrative judicial or mediation procedure in which the child is affected and ensure that the childs opinion is taken into account according to the childs age and maturity and adopt national uniform standard implementing regulations and guidelines accordingly in particular in relation to all decisions concerning unaccompanied or separated children arrived in the state partyalso in the same document it is highlighted the necessity to conduct some research to understand how much the voices of children and young people are heard in family decisions in communities and schools bthe regulatory indications define the concept of child not only as the recipient of protective measures but as a person with cognitive and social skills able to participate in the decisionmaking processfor the adults called to enter into relationships with children and responsible for decisionmaking processes this involves considering them as key experts in the situations they are experiencing allowing them to be active partners in defining interventions in their favour cashmore  la valle et al  mitchell et al  milani serbati looking at the highest levels of the different scales that in the scientific literature on social work theoretically define the concept of participation hart  shier  it is possible to affirm that participation experiences are all the more effective if they involve the possibility for children to influence decisions concerning their life and expertsadults are open to

a right but also because it is what they want in fact children ask to be able to participate mcauley et al  mitchell et al  and it is proven that when they can participate they are listened to and their opinion is taken into account the resulting interventions result in better outcomes most likely because they meet their needs and therefore are more accepted calcaterra and raineri  fernandez  hetherington and cooper  mason  kiely in their review of the literature on childrens participation in child protection contexts vis and colleagues  underline the following points when participation is understood as a process and not as a spot intervention children are informed and have the opportunity to understand what is happening and the possible courses of action are helped to express their opinions and updated on what is happening their participation has positive outcomes also from a psychological point of view in fact they feel empowered as their ability to reflect on what is happening their selfesteem and the sense of control of their life increase with consequent decrease of their anxiety and stresstherefore the practitioners must prepare the conditions for listening to children and accepting their points of view because they can effectively contribute to defining concrete projects resulting in successful interventions in the lives of children and their families in view of the desired improvementhowever there are several obstacles to the concrete and effective participation of childrenparadoxically one of the difficulties could depend precisely on their relationship with social workers who should listen to them hoy  often social workers are also in contact with their parents or other practitioners involved in their family life this could be intimidating or limit the possibility of the youngest children to talk with them freely furthermore social workers have the responsibility to decide in the childrens best interest which is not necessarily what the youngest children would want for their lives this is another situation that could become an obstacle to participation boylan and dalrymple  oliver et al  pithouse et al  the difficulty in talking with social workers even in the presence of a relationship of trust ulvik  arises from the awareness of the decisionmaking power that adults have over their life at other times difficulties result from the children not knowing how the information they will share with adults will be used or the fact that the things they have to say are about the relationship with the professionals or the reference adults with whom they should talk barnes  boylan and ing  tucker some research shows that children often find it difficult to report existing or potentially abusive situations to the social workers roche and tucker  tucker  in these situations young children feel misunderstood limited by the system isolated and judged by their practitionersalso for the social workers promoting and creating opportunities for childrens in child protection services is not easy among the many difficulties experienced by the practitioners there is the need to decide in the best interests of children while considering the interests of other parties involved parents organisations the intent to protect children from difficult and painful situations the possible restrictions on participation imposed by the judicial authority archard and skivenes  barnes  gallagher et al  sander and mace  vis and thomas  winter besides various empirical research works conducted in italy by protection services highlight the fact that child participation is controversial and subject to difficult interpretation these researches show that the adoption of a listening approach and spaces for participation are insufficient or absent in decisionmaking processes aglietta et al  belotti et al  belotti  landi a patt a recent research conducted on the meaning that practitioners give to the concept of participation of children and their families in child protection calcaterra and raineri  shows a certain polarisation some understand participation in therapeutic terms confusing it with compliance with the paths defined by adults and those who instead recognise its authentic meaning and state the need for a collaboration in which decisions are made and done together with the childrenthere are still many uncertainties about how the participation of children and young people in child protection should be realised the literature review conducted by van bijleveld and colleagues  reveals significant differences with respect to how practitioners and children understand participation children consider participation as being able to express their own opinions on all the decisions that concern them and not only on what operators choose as well as having their opinion considered  for the practitioners instead the concept of participation is often associated with the idea of obtaining and giving information to define solutions to the problems they have definedthe responsibility of adults in creating opportunities for participationin every situation the opractitioners must reflect on how they can guarantee opportunities to promote the childrens concrete and positive participation being open to listening is not enough the adults also have the responsibility to prepare the conditions bell  cashmore  donnelly  pert et al  social workers should create dialogic opportunities suitable for children help them express their point of view listen to what they have to say and consider their opinions in the decisionmaking process besides they should motivate them if they need to depart from what they have expressed and desired lundy  however it should be remembered that childrens participation does not mean delegating decisionmaking responsibility to them kennan et al even when children are allowed to participate in meetings organised taking into account their presence research shows that it is still not easy for them to participate they often do not understand the purpose of the meetings they are invited to they feel intimidated anxious or embarrassed to talk about their difficulties before adults gathered to listen to them daly  hoy  muench et al in their essay on the conditions for effective participation of children and their families healy and darlington  indicate the attitudes that the child protection social workers are called to adopt for example the respect for each persons skills participating in the decisionmaking processes the appropriateness of the aid interventions that must be defined together with the people involved and their modalities of participation and the transparency in the communication process initiated to make decisionsat the international level there are numerous experiences of structured practices for the participation of children and young people in the definition of interventions for their wellbeing for example the development of family group conferences burford  dalrymple  morris  and dialogic practices arnkil  in many european countries and the provision of the support of an advocate to facilitate the participation of children in formal decisionmaking processes in anglosaxon countries boylan and ing  boylan and dalrymple  several researches show the importance of the support of an independent practitioner acting as an advocate boylan and dalrymple  dalrymple  munro  noon  vis et al  kennan et al  bell  chase et al  jelicic et al  oliver et al  such a role has a great diffusion especially in anglosaxon and northern european child protection services while in italy it is at its first implementations calcaterra advocacy in support of childrens participationadvocacy is an antioppressive dalrymple burke  dominelli  relational social work practice folgheraiter   aimed at helping people express their opinions and be heard in the decisionmaking processes that affect themgenerally the natural advocate of children is the parents or family members who take care of them however children experiencing adversity in their family who are removed from it or their parents are subject to parental supervision orders by the juvenile court lose their natural representativesthe social workers therefore have the vital task of assuming this function and helping the children whose protection they are responsible for expressing their opinions and participating in the decisionmaking processes that affect their livesindependent professional advocacy takes the form of the intervention of an operator specifically trained to help children participate in decisionmaking processes this means helping children to understand information conceptualise possible courses of action decide what to report to the operators required to intervene for their protection when necessary the advocate should help them express their point of view in formal decisionmaking events and make sure that what they report is duly taken into account the professional action of the advocate is guided by specific principles independence childoriented work confidentiality and empowerment calcaterra advocates can help to actualise the right of children to be authentically listened to however they also help practitioners who have to decide for their protection to understand better the critical elements and the available resources to implement concrete help paths boylan ing  calcaterra  la valle et al  martin franklin the first experiences introducing a professional advocate in child protection services in italy calcaterra a b calcaterra and folgheraiter  show that children understand how to use their support effectively in fact they realise that this intervention promotes concrete participation and empowerment counteracting the obstacles and difficulties that they experience in formal protection processesthe researchthis paper presents some case studies based on the critical best practice perspective ferguson  taken from wider action research works which were carried out to experiment with the practice of independent professional advocacy this research intends to set out examples of best practices to promote learning on advocacy issues through case studies a case study is an indepth study of a single unit a relatively bounded phenomenon where the scholar aims to elucidate features of a larger class of similar phenomena gerring  p  the aim of case studies from a critical best practice perspective is to illustrate how such work could promote personal and systemic change in the services guiding social workers in identifying positive supportive and antioppressive resources for their workthe case studies presented were selected from situations known to one of the authors as supervisor and researcher in the action pilot projectsthe purpose of the pilot projects is to experiment with an independent professional advocate who supports some looked after children attending social pedagogic day care centres the advocates intervention aims to promote their participation in the new definition or redefinition of their care plans at these centressocial care workers weekly manage a social pedagogic day care centre dcc usually those who attend a dcc are looked after children with family situations of neglect that however do not result in the total removal of the children from homedccs can be managed by nonprofit organisations or directly by local authorities and generally host up to  children simultaneouslysocial workers from local authorities have to make a referral to enrol a child in a dcc and each child has hisher care plan regarding activities school supports contacts with parents and relatives often children and young people who attend a dcc have cognitive behavioural andor emotional issues related to the difficulties they experience in their families the children attend the centre after school in some cases they can also have lunch there remaining at the centre during the afternoon until dinner time at day care centres children can have support for schoolwork and participate in activities with other children or individuallythe social workers managing the dccs have direct contact with parents and in some cases also organise support interventions for the childrens parentsthe research aims to gain an enhanced and practice understanding of the independent advocacy support in these services to conduct a critical reflection on advocates functions and strategies to set up advocacy projects in day care centresconsidering the presence of independent professional advocacy is not widespread in the italian child protection system the cases presented can be considered best practices for the following reasonsthe services that activated the advocacy were prepared on the work of the independent advocate with training sessions in which they were able to clarify the difference between the social workers and the advocates workthe operators of the activating services were supported by the researchers in defining the situations that could benefit from an advocacy intervention and had the correct characteristics parental agreement availability of children agreement by other professionals concerns about which decisions needed to be madethe advocates who worked in these projects were trained by the most expert teachers on the subject in italymethodological supervision was guaranteed in all phases of the advocacy interventionsthe outcome of the advocates work had an impact on the childrens care plan at the dccs and in some cases also on the organisation of the centres activitiesbased on the above reasons it is believed that the advocacy interventions that will be presented followed the appropriate methodological phases critically and reflectively and respected the working principles set out in theory even though they took place in different organisations these cases therefore represent possible examples of the support offered by independent professional advocates and how they can ensure greater childrens participation in the definition of their care plansin this article five situations are presented in which young people worked with an advocate the description of these situations is based on an analysis of the referral document drawn up by the practitioners who requested the advocacy activation the analysis of the advocates work is based on the documentation of the supervision meetings and the diary written by the advocates the feedback from the dcc operators was collected through the monitoring meetings of the pilot action research projects finally the children who benefited from the support of an advocate were interviewedfor the analysis of the situations permission was requested from the childrens parents and their social workers as all the participants in the research were looked after children before proceeding with the interview each child was individually informed about the purpose of the research the outline of the interview and the information already in possession of the researchers on their situation information obtained through their parentssocial workers on this occasion the children were able to ask questions about the work of the researchers the purpose of the research and how their testimony would be used they were told that they could choose whether or not to join the research all the children to whom the proposal was made decided to participate in the interviewthe interviews were carried out electronically due to the geographical distance and the regulations on the containment of the covid pandemic some social workers experienced how children feel more able to talk about their situations when the communication with the operators is mediated by a screen pink et al  even in this research although the particularity of the situation is recognised no difficulties were met in carrying out remote interviews as the participating children were willing to meet with the researchers through this modality although the research focused on specific issues the interviews were conducted with a low degree of structuring after an initial description of the work done with the advocate the interviews followed the path proposed by the children proceeding with reopening topics and open questions the interviews lasted between  minutes and  hour and were recorded and verbatim transcribed the transcripts were then sent to the children according to the agreements made with each of them to verify the accuracy of the content and allow them to integrate or modify themadvocacy activation reasons and outcomesthe social workers involved in the research participated in information and training meetings on childrens participation and the work of the independent professional advocate besides flyers were prepared and distributed to adults operators and parents and young people yp in all the projects the advocates organised some meetings at the dccs involved introducing themselves to the yp and explaining their work together they also gave the yp their telephone numbers in case they wanted to request the support of the advocate directlyin all situations the advocacy intervention was proactively activated the advocacy intervention was requested by the yp social care workers of the dccs only in one case the referral was made by social workers from the local authoritythe social workers filled out the referral form with the following informationname and contact details of the activating practitionerinformation relating to the yps situation name address person to contact to organise the first meeting any restriction contained in the juvenile court orderconcerns of the social worker and issues to be addressed with the yp through the advocate supportfeedback times and methods meeting with operators to listen to the yps opinions and requestssignature of the social workers and parentsthe advocate helped the social workers to fill in the form with a clear concrete and understandable language even for children the advocate then used this form starting from the first meeting with the children to share the information and issues on which the practitioners were interested in hearing their opinioneach advocate then met individually with the yp to whom the intervention was proposed to verify their willingness to use this support all the yp agreed to work with the advocatethe situations analysed and the outcome of the work carried out together with the advocates are summarised belowdanieldaniel is  years old his parents are separated and have a highly conflicted relationship daniel lives with his mother he often feels involved in the conflict between his parents and does not feel listened to by his father who at times frightens him daniel has been attending the dcc every day for about a year he does not always seem serene and at times shows anger and refuses to participate in the activities his social worker is interested in understanding how to organise meetings with the father thinking that they can take place at the centre or with the help of social care workers she wants to know daniels point of view on the matter the social worker meets both of the childs parents regularly and feels this involvement does not help daniel speak freely about his point of view with her therefore she thinks that the intervention of an independent advocate could be beneficialadvocacy outcomesdaniel discussed the social workers request with the advocate he realised that he could express his concerns to the adults without fear thanks to the advocates help he asked the advocate for support in communicating to his father and the social worker as he would like to see his father less frequently and above all he did not want to meet him at the centre daniel expressed his desire to protect his attendance at the dcc which was for him a serene space despite his attitude the social worker accepted daniels requests which lowered his anger level allowing the boy to experience another way of relating to adults and peers at the centresamuelsamuel is  years old the parents are separated he lives with his father who cannot take care of him during the day as he is at work samuel has been attending the dcc for about  months he has relational difficulties with his classmates major challenges at school struggles to accept the rules of coexistence in a group and recently his behaviour at the dcc has worsened after considering his relational difficulties also with the practitioners of the centre his social care worker thinks it could be useful for samuel to meet an independent advocate to understand how to help him feel better at the centreadvocacy outcomessamuel explained to the advocate that he does not understand why he has to attend the centre he said that sometimes the social care workers reprimand him for his behaviour and he struggles to accept the rules that he sees as punishment he also shared that he is not interested in the recreational activities offered and that he would rather go and play football with his school friends rather than be at the centre with the other children with the advocates help he understood that the decision regarding his attendance at the centre depended on the social worker from the local authority he then asked for a meeting with this social worker in which he participated with the advocate during this meeting samuel received a clearer explanation of the reasons he has to attend the centre he also managed to explain his dissatisfaction and asked not to be forced to go to the centre alternatively he proposed to stay at the centre only for the time necessary to carry out his schoolwork and then to be able to join his friends at the soccer field the social worker decided to take some time to reflect on these requests with her colleagues from the child protection service team they then scheduled a new meeting for the following week during the second meeting the social worker told samuel that could leave the centre two afternoons a week after having done his homework to join his friends with the agreement that on the other days he would participate in the activities of the centre the boy accepted the proposal the care plan was then redefined and subsequently communicated to the social care workers of the dccalessandraalessandra is  and she has been attending dcc for several years she has school difficulties and emotional insecurity in relationships with adults at home the family situation is precarious the parents have some economic and relational difficulties struggle to recognise their daughters emotional needs and cannot support her in her educational path for some time now the social care workers of the dcc have noticed that alessandra is unresponsive and no longer interested in the proposed activities therefore they would like to understand how to rekindle her interest and redefine her care plan they tried several times to talk to her about this but she never opened up on the subjectadvocacy outcomeswith the advocates help alessandra understood the concerns of the care social workers which she said she had not noticed despite the various attempts they made to talk to her she reflected with the advocate on her apparent dissatisfaction and managed to find the words to explain that she has no particular difficulties with the social care workers she was happy to attend the centre however she was no longer interested in the proposed activities with the advocates help she asked the social care workers for a meeting in which they agreed on the importance of rescheduling the activities for the young people who attend the centre together with all of them thus some meetings for the participatory redesigning of the activities of the dcc were startedmansourmansour is  years old he has been attending the dcc for several years not always consistently in recent months the centre operators had noticed that mansours commitment to the objectives of his attendance at the centre had greatly decreased and the boys relationship with his social care worker had been damaged through the advocacy the social care workers asked mansour to reflect on his care plan and on how he could improve the situation between them to reestablish a serene attendance at the centreadvocacy outcomeswith the advocates help mansour was able to reflect on his way of being at the centre recognising that recently his commitment to the agreed goals had dropped his absences from scheduled appointments had increased and for this reason the relationship with the social care worker had deteriorated he also understood that he was asked to propose solutions to improve his relationship with the social care worker mansour did not accept this assignment passively and asked for a meeting with the social care worker to reflect together on how to find a solution to their difficulties believing that they share them working with the advocate was also an opportunity for mansour to request to be included in a group activity that would allow him to socialise more with his classmates and increase the afternoon support at the centre on the occasion of challenging class assignments or school tests the social care worker accepted the boys requests and in the feedback meeting proposed a trial time to rethink their relationship or alternatively change the reference social worker for his attendance at the centrealinaalina is  years old and she has been attending the dcc for  years in the last year the main goal of her care plan has been to support her in school to avoid an early dropout alina began to attend the centre less consistently making many absences on the days in which she attends the centre alina shows disinterest in the activities her social care worker at the centre asked for an advocacy intervention to agree on the care plan that would allow alina to go back to a more beneficial attendance at the centreadvocacy outcomeswith the help of advocate alina while acknowledging that she needed support for schoolwork support and preparing for classwork reflected on the fact that the school support organised at the centre was not helping her in her opinion the volunteers who assisted the operators of the centre in these activities were not sufficiently qualified alina expressed to the advocate the expectation that the social workers would discuss with her the difficulties she was facing at school and find more qualified volunteers to help her supported by the advocate alina found the courage to report these considerations to the social care workers of the dcc in addition she asked to continue attending the centre only on the condition that she would be supported by new volunteers qualified to help her in the school subjects she found most difficult during the feedback meeting the social care worker expressed the need to discuss her requests with the team a few days later alina received the proposal from the social care worker to work together to develop a personalised care plan for school support following which they would identify volunteers able to help her more effectivelythe point of view of the young people involvedas also shown by other research works on the activation of advocacy in italian services in these experiences the young people immediately and easily understood the different role of the advocate compared to that of other social workersit is a person who tries to help you understand how to say something to another adult if i cant say something to my social care worker this person helps me say it a little in various ways alessandralets say that the advocate does the work that children do not do  if im afraid to say it i tell him im afraid to say this and that and he tells it to my parents for me danielthe young people involved easily understood the differences between the professional position of the advocate and that of the other practitioners involved in their protection projects they perceived the characteristics of independence and confidentiality of this relationship which allowed them to speak openly with the advocate maintaining control over the communication without the fear that the situation will get out of handthe advocate can keep the things you say confidential that what we say remains between us she is different from the other social workers if for example i talk with a social care worker and what i have to say is about another social care worker since they talk to each other its not a good idea if it were not so i wouldnt have to speak with the advocate mansoursocial care workers help you learn even with social care workers you can talk but maybe you trust the advocate more it is a space where you are in private and only the two of us can talk samuelthe children and young people who benefited from the intervention of the advocate realised its usefulness fortheir wellbeing in a general sense without necessarily having to request the assistance of the advocate to present their requests to other adultsyou let off steam with her a little talk and then she can help you tell the social care workers things you can say things you dont want to tell others because maybe you do not trust them alinareflecting on their situation understanding possible courses of action and consciously deciding what to report about their point of view to other adultswith the advocate we made a list of points based on previous interviews i wrote down some negative and positive facts about the relationship with my social care worker and we chose whether or not to talk about them with her which are the pros and cons in saying these things and whether they could bring disadvantages to me in the long run mansourgetting help in saying and communicating their opinions to the adults involved aware that they cannot always do it alonei felt the need for help before the advocate was there sometimes i tried to bring the problems and sometimes i gave up  i was afraid of the consequences maybe the social care worker was offended or retorted the argument and this worried me and i didnt like it for these reasons i thought i dont say anything and thats it and ill see how it goes with the advocate i felt more confident that i could say the things i wanted perhaps the fact that there was also the advocate at the final meeting gave me the courage to say everything and not keep everything inside mansourgenerally it is possible to state that the yp recognised that they benefited personally from the work done with the advocate they felt that they were helped and that things changed because they managed to make their voices heard by those who have the power to make decisionseverything has changed my way of being before if there was something that did not suit me i ran away from that problem now i feel responsible i face it i know i can say things without getting angry things that arent okay with me not only at the centre but everywhere even at home danielit went well they listened to me and we decided how to work together to make things better at the centre alessandrathe point of view of social workersthe social workers from the local authorities and the dccs participated in the monitoring meetings of the action research projects for advocacy implementation during these meetings it was reported on the activations conducted and the practitioners expressed their considerations on the work carried out from the analysis of the documentation on these meetings it is possible to define the experience of the social workersthe initial training on the principles of independent professional advocacy was essential to understand the specific characteristics of this intervention and the fact that it did not replace the social workers listening to the children therefore it was possible to diffuse resistance and fears of seeing their role invaded felt especially by the social care workers who daily met and would continue to meet with the ypthe social workers were able to redefine their work on the basis of the considerations shared by the yp with the advocates help during the final feedback meetingin cases where the yp with the help of their advocate raised criticisms regarding the dcc organisation practitioners appreciated that they also proposed strategies and suggestions that from their point of view could improve their experience at the centre the functioning of the centre itself besides the social care workers showed a great willingness to rethink their work question themselves and invest their resources to improve the centre taking into account the childrens and young people experience the practitioners had the opportunity to reflect on the fact that the advocates presence forced them to put the children back at the centre broadening their vision on possible projects rethinking what they believed was important for the children and accepting the aspects reported by them as a priority consequently they took due account of what the children had expressed to them partly redefining the intervention projectsfinal considerationsthe advocacy intervention resulted in an opportunity for the young people to reflect openly on the issues they deemed important to communicate to the adults and be prepared for such communication without fear of the consequencesthe characteristics of independence and confidentiality of the advocates intervention allowed them to freely express their concerns and expectations regarding their stay at the dccs they could freely discuss what was relevant to them what did not satisfy them and wanted to be changed moreover they had an opportunity to experience that things could actually change with their contributionthe independent position of the advocacy practitioner allowed them to share their difficulties and concerns with an adult bond to confidentiality and expert in the field who however had no responsibility in evaluating their situation therefore they tried to understand how to communicate these concerns to the adults confident in the support of their advocate and the communication process then together with the advocate they had the opportunity to reflect on how to change the situations if the adults in charge of the decisionmaking process would listen to their considerationsin all situations the yp asked for the advocate support even in the feedback meeting with the social workers the advocates presence was felt like a guarantee that they would be listened to seriously and that they would get answers even if not necessarily in the direction they had outlinedthe advocates support promoted a process of empowerment in the yp by helping them understand that they could actively contribute to change their lives in collaboration with the adults responsible for their protectionin the cases analysed the support of an independent advocate allowed the yp toask for explanations of their obligation to attend the centre and redefine the length of their stayfind the courage to communicate the difficulties and dissatisfactions concerning the relationship with those who should have listened to them without the fear of offending adults or not meeting their expectationspropose different ways of organising the activities to be carried outreplan the individual care plans or group activities at their centrethe effects of the advocates intervention in these situations werean experience of empowerment for the yp who arrived prepared for the meeting with the adults and for this reason were listened to and learned that they could influence the decisions that concern themthe social workers work responding better to the needs expressed by the yp which they could understand better thanks to the exchangethe participatory redefinition of projects that became more protective and corresponding to the expectations of the ypin some cases the improvement of the service thanks to a participatory replanning work with the service usersfinally advocacy interventions result in greater respect for the rights of participation and selfdetermination of children being recognised as capable of reflecting on their situation seriously and competently such interventions also help adults recognise and effectively enforce childrens right to participation even in the decisionmaking processes of child protection in compliance with the limits set by the juvenile court to protect themthe experiences described show how independent professional advocacy can help define the care plans of the lookedafter children attending a day care centrehowever it should be mentioned that all the dccs that participated in the advocacy implementation were already very sensitive to the issue of childrens participation interested in listening to them and willing to review their work eventually in italy independent professional advocacy in child protection decisionmaking processes is not yet established institutionally and legally this means that there are no independent advocacy projects that children and young people can contact directly their interventions can only be requested by adults in the framework of specific projects to introduce advocacy serviceshence the power to create opportunities for childrens participation remains in the hands of the adults for this reason the work carried out by advocates in educating and raising awareness about child participation is crucial also to consolidate and expand their involvement in support of children

basin thanh hoa to phan thiet with a total area of  km vietnam has a coastline of  km from mong cai in the north to ha tien in the southwest the part of the east sea under vietnams sovereignty extends to the east and southeast surrounded by a continental shelf large and small islands and archipelagosvietnam has more than  rivers with a length of  km or more including  main rivers fig  there are  river basins nationwide with a catchment area larger than  km the total area of the river basins across the country is over  km due to the influence of topographic factors the river basins in the north northern midland and mountainous and red river delta have a lower surface fanshaped flowing in the direction of northwest  southeast in addition the hydrological regime of rivers is also influenced by climatic factors with the rainy season coming early which makes the amount of water in the rainy season quite abundant slow drainage tends to prolong the flood because rivers are fanshaped flowing into a few main streams leading to stagnant river water and causing floodwater to rise quickly and descend slowly national environment report  the topography of the central region north central coast south central coast tends to lower from west to east the central region has a dense density of rivers and streams divided into many small river basins often with narrow river beds steep slopes and small catchment areas the flow of rivers is usually fast with a large flow in the rainy season and often causes flooding in the downstream areas in the central highlands virtually rivers run east to west and its flow distribution in the year is seasonal the flood season starts from august to november with the total flow volume accounting for about  of the total year volume the southeast region includes the dong nai river basin and a system of other small river basins located in the coastal area surface flow in rivers in this region is divided into two distinct seasons with the flood season usually  to  months later than the rainy season and the dry season the flood season lasts for  months starting from june and ending in november saltwater intrusion is a concern for the downstream area of dong nai  saigon river basin the level of saline intrusion is influenced by the flow rate from upstream and saltwater intrusion gradually increases at the end of the flood season reaching the highest value at the end of the dry season national environment report  the terrain of the mekong delta is lower in two directions from north to south and from west to east the hydrological and hydraulic regimes in the mekong delta are very complicated accordingly the quality of the water environment also varies by region the mangrove distribution and saltwater intrusion process in the mekong delta are influenced by the irregular semidiurnal tide regime of the east sea which has affected about    million hectares of landthe geographical area of vietnam extending from  degrees latitude from north to south and the high altitude makes its climate very heterogeneous the north has a more or less continental climate government portal of the socialist republic of vietnam  the east sea plays an important role in the formation of climate conditions in vietnam due to the influence of the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the atmospheric circulation which causes different weather patterns on the coastal areas in vietnam nguyen  vietnam has a very large amount of solar radiation with sunshine hours from  to  hoursyear and the annual mean air temperature in vietnam ranges from oc to oc with a tendency to rise gradually from north to south annual rainfall is significant in all regions and torrential in some ranging from  to  mm and is typically measured between  to  mm with  to  during the rainy season there are about  rainy days per yearalong the stretching territory vietnams climate is categorized into  regions the north the central and the south the north northern midland and mountainous and red river delta has hot and humid and heavy rainfall in summers due to the southwest monsoon april to september little rain and very cold in winters due to the influence of the northeast monsoon from octobermarch the average monthly precipitation in the north ranges between  mm with the highest and lowest rainfall is observed in july august and january respectively jica  the central region has a shorter and less cold winter than the north with the rainfall concentrating in the last months of the year and the summer is influenced by the southwest monsoon which is very hot and dry the north central coast regions from thanh hoa to thua thien hue has a transitional climate because it lies between the northern and southern climate zones separated by the hai van pass the rainy season is coincided with the northeast monsoon september to december and the dry season is affected by southeast monsoon the average annual precipitation ranges from  mm of which approximately  occurring in the rainy season the climate in the south central region south central coast and central highlands is also transitional due to the influence of the northern and southern monsoon climate in southern vietnam southeast region and mekong river delta the climate is hot all year round with a rainy season may to october and a dry season november to

area where the impact of the typhoon invasion from september to november is huge the annual precipitation patterngeological structure of indochina peninsula and vietnam sudo et al  the basic geological structure of the indochina peninsula consists of three cratons one is the indochina craton kon tum craton expanding from eastern thailand southern laos to central and south vietnam and occupying most of cambodia next is the southern china craton which consists in south china south of changjiang river to northeastern vietnam and the shanthai craton is the last one stretching from northeastern myanmarshan plateau western thailand to malaya several terrains fill the periphery of these cratons the exposure of the bedrock is limited and in a large area the bedrock is covered with mesozoic and paleozoic sedimentary rocks and igneous rocks from the archean to the cenozoic eras of the indochina craton the oldest precambrian bedrock in vietnam is partially exposed in the kon tum plateau in central and southern vietnam and the song coi river basin in the north together with igneous rocks derived from igneous activity from the end of the tertiary to the quaternary era the basalts of vietnam are scattered and red and infertile ferralsols oxisols are distributed on a relatively flat and stable topographical surface fig a on the other hand in northeastern thailand and the cambodian plains on the same indochina craton coarsegrained sedimentary rocks cover the basement rocks and sandy soils arenosols generated from them are widely distributed most of the mountainous areas of vietnam other than  above are thickly covered with sedimentary rocks of the mesozoic and paleozoic eras these areas form the vietnam transverse mountain belt whose topography is generally steep due to the orogeny at the craton boundary associated with the collision and compression of the indian plate with the eurasian plate since the eocene himalayan orogeny the soil repeatedly erodes and forms and with the contribution of intermediate to acidic igneous rocks the distribution of acidic soils such as acrisols alisols ultisols and their related cambisols inceptisols is predominant under warm and humid climatic conditions fig b large rivers in the indochina region flow mainly along the fold zone and a vast delta is formed in the downstream area where a large amount of sediment is supplied as for vietnam these are the red river in the north and the mekong river in the south largescale deltas produce alluvial soils with various particle sizes and mainly coarsetextured alluvial soils from the lower reaches of steep rivers that flow directly from mountainous areas to the sea it is a paddy rice cultivation area fig csummary of the production infrastructure of

area a large part of this area belongs to the warm winter temperate climate cwa where the annual average temperature is below c the steep topography and acidic soils derived from sedimentary rocks are widely distributed it has a common condition with northern indochina and the southernmost part of china such as northern laos and northern myanmar it is a region where ethnic minorities whose main livelihood is slush and burn agriculture live widely on mountain slopes establishing sustainable primary production and livelihoods in this region which is still economically disadvantaged due to indochinas unstable social and economic conditions in the latter half of the th century is essential from the social and economic aspects southern central plateau except for high altitude areas it belongs to the tropical savanna climate zone aw where the annual average temperature exceeds c it is a region centered on the central and southern kon tum plateau which was relatively flat plateaus with an altitude of about  meters or less spread the widely distributed ferralsols is originally oligotrophic but its good physical properties and fertilizer response make it a good area for developing intensive modern agriculture combined with a humid and warm climate currently it is a significant producer of commercial crops such as coffee alluvial plains large lowland areas distribute in the offshore regions of the song coi river in the north the mekong river in the south and large and small rivers along the coast it is currently the main production area for paddy rice still its productivity is variable due to climatic conditions water use conditions and soil conditions in terms of soil texture and has considerable regional specificity the main issues are the establishment

villages lcfrd  nevertheless the french colonialists deliberately developed the regions differently designating the south for agricultural production and the north for industrial development lcfrd besides practicing wet rice as a staple food the french introduced agriculture to the north with products such as coffee tea cotton and tobacco the french also developed several extractive industries such as mining coal iron and nonferrous metals to export due to the north is rich in natural mineral resources in the south agricultural development focuses on rice cultivation and rubber plantation which were the main export commodities industry in the south is largely comprised of food processing plants and factories manufacturing consumer goods lcfrd in  the north and the south were not only split politically but also espoused different economic ideologies the north followed communism and the south adhered to capitalism lcfrd  in that context socialist industrialization was promoted in the north to support efforts to reunify the country after the us intervention in the south in  anh et al  in the north the communist regimes first fiveyear plan  put priority on heavy industry notably virtually the industrial development during this period was attained by foreign assistance from vietnams socialist allies china the soviet union and other eastern bloc nations anh et al  nonetheless the plan was interrupted in  when the us began airstrikes in the north halting the advancement of heavy industry and shifting the remaining economic activity to light industry and agriculture anh et al  lcfrd  during  the us army bombings damaged all six industrial cities as well as most of the provincial and district towns in the north all power stations railway lines all roads bridges and sea and inland ports were seriously damaged or destroyed postponing transportation roads and energy supplies as a result the distribution of raw materials and consumables was severely influenced and delayed any largescale construction work anh et al in the postwar period  the unified country had a plan to boost the domestic economy although the governments second fiveyear plan  aimed extraordinarily high targets for annual growth rates for industry agriculture and national income and aspired to unify the north and south vietnam the goals of the plan were not obtained the economy was still dominated by smallscale production low labor productivity joblessness raw materials and technology shortage scarcity of food and consumer goods lcfrd  the third fiveyear plan  also set more modest targets which were a compromise between the ideological and pragmatic factions and the government highlighted the development of agriculture and industry lcfrd by  vietnam was on the verge of a socioeconomic crisis the government initiated a comprehensive reform called doi moi renovation in december  doi moi was intended to alter for the economy from a centrallyplanned economy to form of market socialism officially termed socialistoriented market economy doi moi combined state intervention mainly in the planning stage and freemarket rules and incentives anh et al  lcfrd  the program abolished agricultural collectives eliminated price controls on agricultural goods and permitted farmers to trade their goods in the marketplace lcfrd  it encouraged private commerce in the production of consumer goods and foreign investment from foreignowned enterprises anh et al  lcfrd  in the late s the achievement of business and agricultural reforms unfolded in the doi moi era was apparent

by  industry and construction by  and services by  compared with the general growth rate of the world economy and the rapid decline of the centrally planned economies of eastern europe and the soviet union in their transition to market economies the growth rates of the vietnamese economy were a remarkable achievementthere was a dramatic increase in the gdp at current prices of services from just  million usd to around  millipon usd between  and  likewise the gdp by industry including construction upward significantly from only  million usd in  to  milliomn usd in  the gdp by agriculture forestry and fishing also experienced a gradual growth from around  million usd to approximately  million in  during the period of  years the structure of economic sectors has changed remarkably the share of gdp in agriculture forestry and fishing hold the largest percent compared to industry and services from the  and earlier world bank b c d because agricultural production was considered the backbone of vietnams development strategy to revive the economy after the countrys reunification in  lcfrd  nevertheless the share of gdp now focuses more on the development of industry manufacturing and services in particular in  the share of gdp in agriculture forestry and fishing was dominant at  followed by service at about  and then industry at  gso  by contrast the share of gdp in services

and korea have adopted the christian era for more than  years they still celebrate new year in their own lunarsolar calendar this is because celebrating the traditional new year is a pledge of allegiance to the nations independency in sinovietnamese vocabulary this is called phng chnh sc  it means to follow the right new year day during vietnam dependence to china vietnam could not have its own calendar and followed the chinese calendar after independence from the ming in  although vietnam still followed the chinese calendar diplomatically like current christian era it created its own calendar domestically different from japan vietnams lunarsolar calendar is still an alternative national calendar authorized by government it is not same calendar if compair with chinese one it sometimes different by year celebrating traditional new year is a testament to the vietnamese peoples loyalty to the nation gratitude to the spirits of ancestors people who work all year long also

YAODY_6__chapter_4_cross-linguistic_variation_in_the_temporal-aspectual_domain_input.json,Book Manuscript,8822,2, 84,1,1,4.5 Summary,chapter  crosslinguistic variation in the temporalaspectual domain resultatives anteriors and perfectivespasts pragmatic motivations for grammaticalization divergence from universal tendencies a new crosslinguistic survey summarythe previous chapters examined the diachrony of the pp and pt in the english language alone tracing the two forms to their origins in the earliest historical records since comparable categories recur widely in many typologically and geographically related languages it is tempting to consider the phenomenon from an integrated crosslinguistic perspective with the aim of gaining deeper insights into plausible universals in language changethis chapter first outlines the resultative  anterior  perfectivepast path which is a wellestablished account for pp grammaticalization in the literature section  it then examines the underlying cognitive and communicative motivations for this path section  this is followed by a discussion of the divergences therefrom and then a reevaluation of its purported universal nature section  its validity for related languages is examined through a crosslinguistic survey section  as will be demonstrated below the diachrony of the english pp and pt is not an isolated phenomenon but is motivated by the interlacing of language use and cognitive forces that operate crosslinguistically as such it is crucial that it be considered in light of a broader picture of the evolution of the diverse grammars of the world resultatives anteriors and perfectivespastsa key tenet of the usagebased perspective of language is that linguistic structures arise from repeated usage through historical processes characterized by recurrent regularities an important aspect of such processes is grammaticalization the term was originally coined by meillet  and was later refined by kuryowicz  as the increase of the range of a morpheme advancing from a lexical to a grammatical or from a less grammatical to a more grammatical status eg from a derivative formant to an inflectional one while this description emphasizes the emergence of grammatical morphemes out of their lexical roots many researchers working within the framework of grammaticalization do not restrict their attention to such a narrowly defined phenomenon but conceive of grammaticalization as part of a long chain of continued developments for hopper and traugott  grammaticalization research is concerned with how lexical items and constructions come in certain linguistic contexts to serve grammatical functions or how grammatical items develop new grammatical functions grammaticalization in this sense focuses on the small steps of change that produce the syntactic morphosyntactic and morphological materials of a language which enable them to further evolve after their grammatical status has been attainedgrammaticalization tends to proceed through crosslinguistic similar paths on the one hand grammatical features with the same lexical source often follow the same course of change on the other hand grammatical features developed from different lexical sources tend to converge in later stages of grammaticalization this can be seen from the fact that many languages across the world share the same functional distinctions within the core areas of grammar for example past vs nonpast tense perfective vs imperfective aspect and epistemic vs deontic modalitya welltravelled grammaticalization path relevant to the diachrony of the english pp and pt was proposed by harris  this fourstage chronology deals with the opposition in romance languages between have periphrases and simple tenses table  summarizes harris original proposaltable  harriss  fourstage chronology of periphrastic and simple past tenses in romancesome definitions should be clarified before examining these stages in detail for consistency we adopted bybee et als  functional labels to describe the meanings expressed by grammatical morphemes a resultative signal indicates that a state exists as a result of a past event an example is be  past participle in english eg he has gone the anterior signals that a situation occurs prior to and are relevant to the situation at the reference anteriors typically translate into english pps and may occur with pastor futuretense marking a perfective signal that a situation is independent of relevance to other situations is viewed in its entirety including both the initial and final endpoints  see section  a past subsumes situations whether recent or not which happened prior to the present moment and are not aspectually marked pasts may cooccur with other grammatical morphemes such as signalling perfectivity progressivity and habituality both perfectives and pasts are often used to narrate sequences of past events as dahl  and bybee et al  noted in their crosslinguistic survey there is a strong correlation between perfectives and pasts an obvious reason for this is that past situations are most naturally viewed in their entirety with temporal boundaries and the same is true vice versathe anterior differentiates them from other grammatical categories in their ability to express current relevance chapter  has shown that the pp in contemporary english explicitly specifies that a past situation leads to a present state whose nature is optimally relevant to the ongoing discourse the current relevance seen in this light is languagespecific and substantiated by various perfect readings targetstate result past experience present continuation etc in earlier english or other languages current relevance may be conventionalized differently resulting in other semantic or pragmatic subcategories that are in turn realized by combinational tendencies with other linguistic features andor routinized contextual inferences thus current relevance needs to be understood in two ways on one hand it is a functional characterization suited to the grammatical description of specific languages and on the other a universally applicable general concept that aids crosslinguistic comparisons the category anterior defined on the basis of current relevance as well as the categories resultative perfective and past belongs to what haspelmath  refers to as comparative concepts which are categories created by linguists for formulating crosslinguistic generalizations comparative concepts should be kept distinct from descriptive categories for particular languages such as the english pp the french pass compose and the spanish pretrito perfectoaccording to harris the four stages in table  for haveperiphrasis in romance represent generalizations of synchronic patterns with historical implications stage i marks the starting point exemplified by the limited number of italian varieties for instance in the calabrian the synthetic past expresses single events regardless of whether they are recent or can extend to the present the periphrastic form is appropriate where the present result state is the focus of attention stage ii is represented by the galician portuguese and some latin american spanish varieties the current relevance of the periphrastic forms in these varieties is further developed but is still limited to durative and iterative contexts only elsewhere the synthetic form is widely used stage iii is illustrated by castilian spanish where the periphrastic form expresses prototypical anterior functions while the synthetic form is restricted to past functions alone this analysis however will be modified in the following sections based on more empirical data finally in stage iv the synthetic form is ousted by the periphrastic form and restricted to written registers most famously represented by french romanian and northern italianharriss fourstage chronology is reminiscent of bybee et al s wellknown resultative  anterior  perfectivepast grammaticalization path in an investigation of evolutionary universals in tense aspect and modality across languages of the world bybee and her colleagues surveyed many typologically distant languages and proposed that resultatives tend to develop into anteriors which in turn tend to become perfectives or pasts this tendency marks the main path of development in the language sample it is argued to be unidirectional in that the morphemes only move forward linearly but not in the reverse direction that is to say former anteriors that have already evolved into perfectives or pasts do not evolve back into anteriors pragmatic motivations for grammaticalizationbybee et al  point out that the crosslinguistic validity of the resultative  anterior  perfectivepast path applies not only to romance but also to other indoeuropean languages and languages in other parts of the world this implies that the diachronic uniformity observed cannot be attributed to linguistic factors alone but is more likely to be the outcome of the interlacing of language use and domaingeneral processes this section outlines the main mechanisms and underlying motivations for this study it will be shown that the path from resultatives to anteriors and then to perfectivepasts can be conceived of as a functional generalization triggered by pragmatic factorsit is often observed that grammaticalization proceeds through a process of generalization or the weakening of semantic content eg givn  fleischman  hopper and traugott  this may involve both lexical items in their way to grammaticalization and grammaticalized functional morphemes lexical items subject to semantic generalization expand their range by developing various polysaccharides thereby appearing in an increasing number of contexts similarly grammaticalized items may extend their functional domains and develop an increasingly larger range of functionsthe resultative  anterior  perfectivepast path can be seen as a paradigm case of generalization originally the have periphrasis was constrained to very local targetstate resultative contexts it appears predominantly with transitive telic verbs and is not compatible with states or activities that do not have inherent final endpoints as a resultative its temporal specification must pertain to the resulting state with time as current relevance becomes conventionalized the construction expands to more new environments cooccurring increasingly frequently with intransitive verbs and combining freely with all situation types temporal specification is no longer restricted to the result state it can be about inherent situational properties such as frequency duration and temporal location these new nonresultative uses develop alongside the original resultative use leading to layering in an expanded functional spacefurther development from anterior to perfectives or pasts involves generalization to an even wider range of contexts in romance this process is well documented eg harris  fleischman  squartini  bertinetto  evidence from other language families includes the chinese mandarin particle le which is derived from the lexical verb liao finish it grammaticalizes first into a sentencefinal particle with anterior functions and the like and then continues to develop a verbfinal use signaling perfectivity with which the anterior sentencefinal use coexists in modern mandarin li et al  in this process the current relevance component of anteriors is lost and the more general meaning of pastness is retained so that the construction is compatible with more pastreferring contexts not related to the present in french until the sixteenth century the expression of a past situation as recent as the previous night still required the use of the synthetic pass simple since then however the periphrastic pass compos has largely taken over to the point that by the seventeenth century the pass simple was in the midst of a crisis in popular speech and that by the eighteenth century it was out in paris of the talk of the people and the petite bourgeoisie dauzat  quoted in harris  the expansion of the current relevance in this case is so broad that it virtually subsumes any past situation reported in informal speechif linguistic change is repeatedly attested across space and time it might be seen as a product of domaingeneral processes that operate across diverse communities an important one of these mechanisms behind the resultative  anterior  perfectivepast path is the cognitive and communicative processes outlined in traugott  dashers  invited inferencing theory of semantic change building on new gricean pragmatics this usagebased model also sees the semantics of a linguistic form as a highly abstract representation that must be enriched in particular contexts the change from one linguistically encoded meaning to another is seen as the outcome of active meaning negotiation between the communicator and the audience governed by gricean maximsin this model semantic change begins with the communicator using a linguistic form that gives rise to an implicature in a particular usage event for communication to be successful she can be assumed to take into consideration not only the linguistic conventions of the community but also the audiences contextspecific assumptions encyclopedic knowledge and other processing factors such as the level of attentiveness and processing capacity the utterance token is formulated such that the audience can successfully uncover the invited inference that the communicator intends gradually the communicative dynamics of particular usage events may recur in other usage events and if they acquire social value the particularized invited inference becomes generalized when the original encoded meaning eventually gives way to the generalized invited inference conventionalization can be said to have occurred and the linguistic form takes on a new encoded meaning in essence semantic change is possible because the specific linguistic norms including semantic norms are hypothetical norms subordinated to the highest norms of communication bartsch  quoted in traugott and dasher to see how the pastwithcurrentrelevance meaning becomes conventionalized in the transition from resultatives to anteriors it is necessary to revisit the relevance principle outlined in chapter  as suggested above a crucial difference between resultatives and anteriors is that with the former the state predicated of the reference time is heavily bound by semantics the lexical content of the targetstate result inference overlaps to a great extent with that of the eventive predicate in contrast with anteriors the nature of such a state is linguistically underdetermined and recovered in specific contexts via a relevancedriven inferential process that prioritizes the maximization of cognitive effects and minimization of processing effort the initial seeds of this development can be found in the earliest uses of the english haveperiphrasis with events involving changes in mental states example  illustratesa cw he nu u t swa openlice ongiten hfstnow that you have so clearly understood this ideaalfreds boethius chapter xxxvin  although the present persistence of an understood idea is a legitimate inference following from the utterance it does not significantly improve ones mental representation of the world and therefore can be said to yield insufficient cognitive effect what is more relevant is the inference that you have already accomplished the understanding process now you clearly understand this idea carey  argues that in the grammaticalization of the haveperiphrasis into an anterior the focus shifts from the object which stands in a stative relation with the targetstate result of a situation to the completed situation itself this shift is facilitated by the lack of relevance of the persisting targetstate result which leads the audience to seek greater relevance from other aspects of discourse similarly in nonresultative contexts where the inherent semantic properties of the situation are incompatible with targetstate results it is necessary to make a further pragmatic inference drawing on contextspecific assumptions to satisfy the expectations of relevance over time repeated use leads to conventionalization of specific inferential instructions encoded in the anteriornonetheless the relevancedriven inferential process does not readily explain the next step of the resultative  anterior  perfectivepast paththe further loss of current relevance concerning this issue a plausible account is proposed by schwenter a b who argues based on spanish dialectal data that hot news use signals the endpoint of the life of an anterior originally identified by mccawley  hot news use refers to an anterior employed to describe a past situation in which the communicator considers significant or newsworthy at the time of utterance eg tuition has gone up again the train station burned to the ground it is strongly motivated by pragmatic considerations insofar as the past situation is related to the present by virtue of its surprise value for the communicator and what the communicator assumes to be its surprise value for the audience this strong pragmatic basis has led many authors to subsume hot news use under another type of perfectresultative mccawley  brinton  michaelis   or experiential mccoard  mccawley  howe unlike these authors schwenter suggested that hot news use embodies a separate discourse function because it has the capacity to introduce a new topic into the discourse thus foregrounding the past situation as such it directs the audiences attention to the situation itself the past situation has present relevance to the extent that only in the present time is it known realized or appreciated binnick   in as much as it holds the most tenuous relation between a past event and the present schwenter a it is argued that the hot news pp most approximates the function of a perfective or past than other uses of the anterior from a diachronic perspective the emergence of the hot news function signals the next stage of grammaticalization the communicator may wish to explicitly mark a past situation whether recent or not as of current relevance so that it can be of sufficient information value for the audience however from the audiences viewpoint this highly abstract subjective form of current relevance is not easily inferable and is subject to erosion given the processing pressures of continued interaction in this way the anterior is generalized to situations of decreased significance and recency resulting in an increased frequency of use which in turn reduces its surprise value the anterior was then allowed to take over the domains of perfectives and pasts in chapter  we revisit this proposal and discuss the further development of anteriors divergence from universal tendencieshaving elaborated on the mechanisms and motivations of the resultative  anterior  perfectivepast path it is necessary to point out several issues in the grammaticalization literature that have remained relatively underexplored and therefore need to be addressed in this study first grammaticalization research is often much more concerned with the development of lexical items into grammatical ones than with the development of new meanings from already grammaticalized items hopper and traugott  refer to these two processes as primary and secondary grammaticalisation respectively as demonstrated in the previous chapter a considerable amount of work in english historical linguistics has focused on primary grammaticalization with only a few exceptions bao et al  elsness  hundt  smith  most studies on the temporalaspectual systemformal functional and sociolinguistichave largely overlooked the potential signs of change in standard varieties of english over the past few centuriesone apparent reason for this lack of attention is that by the late modern period english had already undergone most of the noteworthy grammatical changes by  most of the present repertoire was available denison  however this does not mean that the english of  is the same as today important changes especially those concerning the temporalaspectual system have largely been statistical in nature often realized as frequency changes over an extended period and different rates of change across registers the second and related reason is layering see section  since older functions persist as new functions emerge both are acceptable for speakers in a synchronic state since statistical tendencies tend to be less salient than categorical ones variation and change in grammar often operate below the level of consciousness and may go unnoticed without close scrutiny or the use of quantitative methodsanother limitation in grammaticalization research concerns its very strong emphasis on the universality and regularity of change or predictable paths for semantic change across different conceptual structures and domains of language function traugott  dasher  this may lead to an undesirable lack of attention to counterexamples or divergence from attested paths the pursuit of crosslinguistic regularities should not be done at the cost of oversimplifying variation across languages to illustrate despite its recurrence across space and time and clear domaingeneral motivations the resultative  anterior  perfectivepast path is by no means a categorical tendency harriss  original account does justice to its probabilistic nature stage i is described as the common starting point stage ii represents the next stage of development and is attested almost everywhere stage iii may well emerge from stage ii and stage iv is a widespread but by no means inevitable development from stage iii although harris does not provide counterexamples it is clear that the likelihood of continued grammaticalization along the suggested path decreases as one linguistic item moves from one stage to anotherone recent study that explicitly challenged the universality of the aoristic drift of anteriors was flgstad  examining the use of the periphrastic pp and the synthetic pt across different age groups in argentinian river plate spanish flgstad found that pp has been expanding at the expense of pt which is similar to the situation we described for ame flgstad interpreted the results as a challenge to aoristic drift and thus to the existence of diachronic universals she calls into question the scope and validity of bybee et als  data suggesting that they represent only a tiny fraction of language history flgstad flgstad makes insightful observations concerning the evolution of two competing verb forms examining a range of romance and germanic languages she argues that the real tendency is for the opposition between the anterior and the perfectivepast to disappear and that there seems to be crosslinguistic variation as to which form survives the languages examined were classified into two main types the first includes languages where the functional opposition is aliveas in the case of english where the anterior and the perfectivepast are realized as two distinct forms one periphrastic and the other synthetic the second includes languages with a preference for either the periphrastic or the synthetic the preference specified as a change that is either ongoing expanding or already occurred expanded her results indicate substantial variation in the distribution of the preterit and perfect in romance and particularly so in latin american varieties in which the preterit has expanded in a majority of languages flgstad  this picture stands in contrast to the wellknown romance languages of europe where the periphrastic form has gained territory over that of the synthetic flgstad  therefore concludes this means that in a competing relationship between a perfect and a preterit it appears impossible to predict which category will expand both appear as likely to do sothis otherwise insightful survey has some limitations first the classification scheme results in a misalignment between a synchronic state and diachronic trend that potentially leads to such a state for example in most areas of the iberian peninsula the synthetic form was already replaced by the periphrastic in its anterior value in contrast in some western and northwestern parts of the peninsula this change has not occurred the synthetic form still expresses both anterior and perfective meanings in the asturian galician and so on penny  as a synchronic fact this stronger preference for the synthetic form suggests that grammaticalization may simply be less advanced or may have proceeded at a slower rate in these varieties yet it has been inappropriately interpreted as evidence for the expansion of the pt another limitation is that this survey was restricted to romance and german languages it is not clear why it does not include other languages such as greek slavic and baltic which have similar temporalaspectual contrasts and are therefore potentially subject to the same types of change a new crosslinguistic surveyin view of the above limitations this section conducts a more extensive survey of languagesdialects to which the opposition between the haveperiphrasis and pt is relevant the aim is to shed further light on their diachronic fortunes from a wider crosslinguistic perspective the focus will only be on languages with grammaticalized haveperiphrasis consisting of a presenttense auxiliary derived from the lexical source have and a participial main verb as dahl   and many others have shown haveperiphrasis is a prominent feature of though not entirely exclusive to european languages it is also one of the twelve main features that distinguish standard average european from other linguist areas across the world haspelmath  morphologically marked pt exists in virtually all these languages irrespective of remoteness and aspectual distinctions dahl  velupillai  the term pt is used here to recognize the predominantly perfective or past functions shared by the forms under investigation regardless of whether they are synthetic or periphrastic this expedient designation may not precisely correspond to the specific formmeaning mappings of individual languages in addition note that the present survey is restricted to languages with available grammatical descriptions and is biased towards linguistically welldocumented regionstable  presents in total fifty languages which meet the above selection criterion the two verb forms were analyzed in terms of their ability to express anterior and perfectivepast functions for better visualization the languages of europe are displayed on the map in figure  all fifty languages were classified into five types from a to e based on the following possible functional configurationstype athe have periphrasis functions primarily as a resultative both anterior and perfectivepast meanings are realized by the pttype b the have periphrasis functions primarily as an anterior the pt expresses perfectivepast meanings and may be interpreted as an anterior in some contextstype c the have periphrasis functions primarily as an anterior the pt retains only perfectivepast functionstype d the haveperiphrasis expresses both perfectivepast and anterior meanings pt is restricted to perfectivepast contextstype e the have periphrasis expresses both perfectivepast and anterior meanings the pt is almost or completely losttypes ac correspond to harriss stages iiii to some degree and together types d and e correspond to stage iv however unlike harriss chronology the labels used here only represent the synchronic status of the languages and are not suggestive of linear progression from a to e the importance of setting aside the diachronic aspect is clarified further belowthe languages cover three major subfamilies of indoeuropean languages slavic germanic and romance and five individual languages basque lithuanian albanian breton and modern greek the majority of european languages also allow auxiliary be in periphrastic constructions with intransitive verbs while auxiliary have becomes increasingly common along an easttowest geographical continuum languages that allow only have include english swedish romanian spanish portuguese greek and some contiguous varieties crosslinguistic variation in the selection of have versus be is beyond the scope of this analysis for explanatory accounts the reader may refer to drinka  legendre  and sorace  it should be borne in mind that table  represents at best a simplification of actual complex situations notwithstanding conflicting accounts in some descriptive grammars internal regional and register variation is largely ignored the table only reflects the most evolutionarily advanced status that languages especially in their standard forms have reached note further that languages receiving the same analysis in this table may still differ at more finegrained levelstable  the haveperiphrasis and the pt across languagesdialectsnotes pts include the indoeuropean aorist as well as the slavic lform for latin american romance only selected varieties are represented due to their relative homogeneity compared with europefigure  distribution of types a to e in selected european languagesdialectslet us now turn to the individual languages following their order in table basque the only nonindoeuropean languages included in the survey is basque which falls into type c unrelated with any other living european languages basque has nonetheless developed a haveperiphrasis eg mintzatu naiz i have spoken just as the surrounding romance languages this construction describes recent situations and is incompatible with then adverbials for marking past situations in general basque employs the aspectually neutral pt eg banengoen i stayed see hasse slavic it is well known that tense and aspect in slavic are closely interconnected and present and past tenses both occur with imperfective and perfective aspects respectively however the earlier major temporalaspectual distinction in slavic is between aorist and imperfective in documents in old church slavonic the ninth century the aorist is the predominant past form followed by the imperfective drinka  this opposition later gave way to a construction consisting of a be auxiliary and an lform derived from the aorist stem originally anterior in value this construction gradually took on the pastreferring functions it first replaced the older imperfective and then the aorist becoming the most widely used past marker in slavic as already indicated this process mirrors the anterior  perfective path in western european languages but probably happened much earlier by the fourteenth century the aorist had already been lost in old polish and had begun to diminish in old czech by the sixteenth century it had disappeared completely in old russian anderson  anderson  arkadiev  wiemer  concomitant with this process is increased use of the lform without be this shift is subject to regional variation such that the auxiliary is now completely lost in eastern slavic russian ukrainian belarussian but is retained elsewhere especially in southern slavic see lhermitte as the lform is capable of carrying both perfective and imperfective markings a new obligatory opposition emerged between perfective and imperfective paving the way for a full systematicization of tense and aspectual distinctions andersen  today the lform has already evolved in most slavic languages into a general past marker that also serves an anterior function it appears with both perfective and imperfective aspects in slavic eg  vypil vino i drankhave drunk the wine vs  pil vino i was drinking the wine in russianin some southern slavic varieties bulgarian macedonian serbian and croatian where the older aorist vs imperfective opposition remains the anterior function can be expressed by the aorist example  illustratesbulgariannapisalisidomanotowritepfvaorqrflhomeworkhave you done your homeworklindstedt as for the have periphrasis in slavic the situation is rather complicated many slavic languages have a construction consisting of the auxiliary have and the ntparticiple to which clancy  refers as the new slavic perfect as a later development this construction is lacking in northeast slavic but has become more common in belarusian and ukrainian and is fairly widespread over west slavic especially in spoken vernaculars abraham  arkadiev  wiemer  drinka  consider example polishonmatomiejscesprzedanehehaveprsdemplacesellpfvpstpphe has sold this placewiemer  giger because the object cannot be interpreted as being in a state of possession by the subject the reading of  is clearly a targetstate resultative have periphrases already existed in old czech the end of the twelfth century and old polish the end of the thirteenth century and are attested in the oldest slovak documents from the early seventeenth century most patients do not show any sign of becoming anterior giger   mendoza  arkadiev and wiemer  observe that although widespread all over west and south slavic haveperiphrases are particularly resistant to change this means that most slavic languages can be characterized as instantiations of type amacedonian an exception in slavic is macedonian a typeb balkan language the macedonian have periphrasis has also gained a clear experiential function for example jas imam rabotenovo trgovijata i have been working in trade remarkably this construction can be used as an emphatic statement of current relevance extending to referents that are no longer alive or existent however the narrative function was not developed in macedonian unlike in some romance and germanic languages arkadiev and wiemer  according to drinka  the uniqueness of macedonian is very likely a consequence of contact with other languages in the balkan sprachbund eg albanian greek and romanian see belowbaltic lithuanian the haveperiphrasis is absent in latvian which does not have a transitive possessive verb whereas in lithuanian the have auxiliary turti and the past active participle have developed anteriorly a similar process involving past active participle occurred in ancient greece ambrazas  notices that while denoting a state resulting from a previous action the lithuanian haveperiphrasis also indicates a relation of the state to its causethe previous action however the construction remains optional in many contexts and can be substituted by other verbal forms most commonly by pt making lithuanian a typeb language see also arkadiev  wiemer albanian among the balkan languages albanian qualifies as a typed language behaving most like western european languages its haveperiphrasis has taken on the function of the unmarked past in some northern dialects and combines freely with then adverbials for example dje e kam par norn dy yesterday i have seen him at two oclock friedman  observes that it can even be used in connected narrative for sequential events in southern albanian dialects it is restricted to the anterior function which again indicates a possible influence from neighboring greek the older pt inherited from indoeuropean remains the unmarked narrative tense in albaniagreek as an instantiation of type b greek deserves a detailed description because of its distinctive verbal system and its profound influence throughout europe as a language of learning and religion the tenses of modern greek comprise two values past and nonpast each of which can inflect perfective and imperfective the perfective past aristos is the most frequently referred to form it may also function as an anterior and may therefore be translated into english pt or pp as shown in example  the hot news function is typically expressed by the aristos hedin modern greekpistike o dholofnoscatchpfvpstpass def murdererthe murderer washas been caughtxtes pistike o dholofnosyesterdaycatchpfvpstpassdefmurdererthe murderer was caught yesterdayhedin greeks long history and highly developed participial system produced four formally distinct have periphrases the oldest consisting of have and an active aorist participle represents the earliest example of a transitive european have periphrasis as a fully grammaticalized anterior it was first discovered in fifthcentury classical tragedies according to drinka  this construction serves as the model for its latin counterpart which later emerged as a template for many european languages however by the time of koine greek c  bce ce this construction had been replaced by an innovative have  object  participial objective complement and in byzantine times the fourth and fifteenth centuries greek developed a third haveperiphrasis with a perfect passive participle which survives in modern greek but has not gained high frequency the youngest construction was formed in modern greek after the sixteenth century based on the aorist infinitive for example xis ksanapi have you been there its typical readings are resultative and experiential and normally do not combine with then adverbials importantly the last few centuries have witnessed an increased preference for pt over periphrastic forms to express anterior meaning drinka  fiedler celtic breton breton is the only celtic language that has developed a haveperiphery heavily influenced by the french the construction existed in breton since at least the fifteenth century orr  the opposition between the pt and the haveperiphrasis largely parallels that in modern french while the former is restricted to the literary language the latter is the preferred form in everyday speech making breton a typed language ternes germanic formal opposition between the haveperiphrasis and pt exists in most germanic languages exceptions to this scenario are yiddish and southern german both representing the final stage of the aoristic drift type e where the have periphrasis has developed into a general past marker and the pt is completely lost in northern germany pt is more frequently used kiefer  thieroff  the other two northern germanic languages dutch and frisian are less advanced along this path retaining pt for narration however the hvac periphrases in these two languages differ from english in that they are perfectly compatible with then adverbials for example ik ha dy man ferline wike sjoen in dutch i have seen that man last week in addition these forms can be used to introduce an isolated past situation as a new topic or list a sequence of separate past situations according to donaldson  dutch perfects render almost all english perfects but most english pts are rendered by either dutch pts or perfects the perfect being more common particularly in speech the same remark can be made for frisiansthe five scandinavian northern germanic languages are type c they behave in many aspects such as in british english the haveperiphrasis has typical anterior functions and cannot cooccur with then adverbials while pt is the norm for narration these striking similarities are highlighted by most reference grammars notwithstanding the different preferences for auxiliary selection and idiomatic usages of some verbs elsness  holmes  hinchliff  lundskrnielsen  holmes  peterson  adams  thrinsson romance aoristic drift has been the most intensively studied phenomenon with respect to continental romance regarding eastern romance languages it is well known that standard romanian and italian have moved close to the final stage type e the pt being largely replaced by the periphrastic form in speech but still functioning as a narrative tense in literary registers squartini  bertinetto  in some southwestern romanian dialects pt is still used in speech whereas in the rest of romania it has taken on comic and ironic overtones that attest to its restricted usage gnczldavies  in italy the main regional divide is between northern and southern italian and the southern varieties show a greater preference for pt among the romance varieties specific to italy sardinian ladin and friulian all spoken in the north are more advanced than sicilian and calabrian spoken in the south replacing pt with periphrastic cordin  note that unlike harris  who regards these southern italian varieties as representatives of stage i squartini and bertinetto  characterize the sicilian and calabrian have periphrases as anteriors arguing that they have developed experiential uses the latter observation is reflected in table  where they belong to type cof particular relevance to this study is western romance especially the languages of spain which serve as historical inputs to latin american varieties their synchronic states are briefly reviewed here further diachronic analysis is carried out in chapter  and comparisons are made with english notably among western romance castilian spanish the language of the kingdom of castile became the national standard throughout the years which is the most advanced in aoristic drift though placed in stage iii by harris  contemporary castilian spanish data demonstrate that pp has clearly extended into the realms of perfectives and pasts schwenter  torres cacoullos  therefore we grouped castilian into type d  see section  a similar case is catalan another typed language in which the haveperiphrasis also takes on some perfective functions by expressing prehodiernal situations under special circumstances the construction may refer to a finished period currel  indicating the affective proximity of the event eberenzgreoles in contrast other western romance varieties have been noted for their conservatism in occitan spoken in southern france the anterior function is expressed by the haveperiphrasis not by the pt a situation that has persisted since the middle ages wheeler  paden  therefore occitan qualifies as a stable type c language as the westernmost variety of mainland europe portuguese are known to have developed a functionally restricted haveperfect that is only used to relate to the present either a durative or an iterative situation in the past depending on whether the situation is atelic or telic portuguese pt may have a past or anterior interpretation relating to either a totally past context or a presentoriented context the nearby northern iberian varieties galician asturian and leonese resemble portuguese in preferring pt over haveperfect in speech type b members reflect an earlier stage of development once shared by the castilian spanish cartagena  harris  lope blanch  to this group of conservative western romances we can add canarian the insular variety spoken on the canary islands of spain near northwest africa which had limited contact with the european mainland for a long time cataln  observes that the canarian pt continues to be used to express specific actions even if they have occurred in the extended present or even at a time immediately prior to the grammatical presenta similar functional division with the pt extending into the realm of the anterior has been frequently documented for romance varieties of latin america traditionally the standard view shared by hispanic linguists eg kany  lope blanch  westmoreland  is that usage in latin american spanish bears resemblance to that in castilian spanish in the early renaissance period in other words pt is generally used more frequently in latin america than in europe harris  viewed these ptpreferring varieties as representatives of stage ii parallel to iberian portuguese and other northern iberian varieties this insight has been confirmed and extended over the past decades by intuitive observations and sociolinguistic studies see westmoreland  for an early overview and more recently by intensive variationist research see schwenter  torres cacoullos  in mexican spanish rodrguez louro  and flgstad  on argentinian river plate spanish hernndez  on salvadoran spanish jara yupanqui  and howe  on peruvian spanish henderson  on chilean paraguayan and uruguayan spanish in chapter  these spanish varieties are examined in further detail in relation to ame and bre findingsseveral conclusions can now be drawn by examining the distribution of types a through e in languages around the world first the survey points to a conspicuous eastwest divide within europe most slavic languages of the east belong to type a and some to type b while nonslavic languages of the west display greater variation represented by all types except a this pattern corroborates drinkas   finding of auxiliary selection in periphrastic perfects across europe  the east predominantly relies on be and the west allows both havebe alternation and have alone this eastwest divide can be attributed to several factors as discussed above the lform which is shared by all slavic languages but is not found in other families is compatible with both perfective and imperfective morphology thereby functioning as a host of aspectual distinctions the semantic unification of the anterior and past perfective into this single grammatical category separates slavic from the western european model built largely based on latin accordingly have periphrasis is restricted to the resultative function in type a languagesmoreover figure  shows that languages whose haveperiphrases are more advanced along the aoristic drift are concentrated in western europe drinka  attributes this distribution to contact arguing that grammaticalization originated in parisian french during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries she even claims that aoristic drift marks the longlasting operation of a single widely diffused shift  a view that is somewhat untenable given the various crosslinguistic attestations of aoristic drift discussed previously however areal factors are at work and contact may intensify separate instantiations of the same process the influence of french as a language of prestige and culture on german italian dutch breton and other contiguous languages cannot be ignored lindstedt  observes that the perfect has become a peculiar maritime category in modern europemost of the languages and dialects with a stable perfect are situated on the fringe of the continent specifically typec languages in figure  or those with symmetric anterior vs perfectivepast oppositions are clustered in nordic countries eg danish icelandic norwegian and southern italy sicilian calabrian typeb languages in which the anterior function is expressed by both verb forms are distributed in areas even more distant from the parisian epicenter the iberian peninsula eg basque portuguese and galician the balkans greek and the baltic rim lithuanian and macedonianon a more theoretical note the findings of the survey illustrate the probabilistic nature of the resultative  anterior  perfectivepast path confirming the observation made in the previous section that the likelihood of grammaticalization along this path decreases as one linguistic item moves from one stage to the next although table  does not lend itself to straightforward quantitative interpretations owing to the convenience sampling method some general tendencies are readily observable of languages with grammaticalized haveperiphrasis the majority have developed anterior functions while the rest are resistant to change and remain resultatives for many centuries as in the cases of earlier slavic languages the probability for anteriors to further evolve into perfectives or pasts is even lower in fact only a handful of languages have accomplished aoristic drift and completely lost their former anteriors the prevalence of types b and c in global languages suggests other complex possibilities for one thing a language may have a fairly stabilized anterior versus perfectivepast opposition over a long period of time showing little sign of further grammaticalization examples include occitan and basque which have remained typec languages for centuries despite their geographical proximity to french and other languages leading the way in aoristic drift second the haveperfect may gradually give way to pt in its anterior function as illustrated by modern greek and varieties of latin american romance although their specific developmental trajectories are very likely to differ the tendency of the pt to expand over time is evidentfinally it can be concluded from this survey that grammaticalization from resultatives to anteriors and then to perfectives or pasts is far from inevitable languages may diverge from this welltravelled path and split into alternative directions at each step of the process when we focus on the opposition between haveperiphrasis and pt in an exhaustive list of languages we find that the specific directions that have been taken to date have strong genealogical and areal underpinnings striking similarities emerge across languages with a common ancestry and consequently inherent structural resemblances in the temporalaspectual systemas the crosslinguistic data suggest the wellknown pattern of aoristic drift of the haveperiphrasis is largely restricted to continental romance outside the romancespeaking regions of europe languages have developed their temporalaspectual systems based on other influential grammatical models the slavic model provides a template for marginalized have periphrasis and a unified lform for past tenses throughout eastern europe further west greek exerted a longlasting influence on the numerous languages with which it came into contact the greek haveperfect has stable anterior function as the first of its kind in europe along with the expanding perfective past aristos the greek model continues to provide important input for modern balkan languages further across the atlantic the american model serves as the epicenter of the western hemisphere this patterned distribution runs counter to flgstad  who claimed that in the competition between the pp and pt it is not possible to predict which category will win outtherefore the crosslinguistic data points to a pluricentric macro picture instead of conceiving the languages as falling into separate stages of a linear diachronic process led by continental romance they are better seen as distributed in different degrees of genealogical and geographical proximity to multiple linguistic epicenters these include but are not restricted to french slavic greek and american people thus the languages of the world are centrifugal in terms of the pppt opposition this macro picture reflects a synchronic reality with diachronic implications the aoristic drift of continental romance represents only one possible and frequently travelled path of development other possibilities remain unexplored summarythis chapter offers an overview of a set of interrelated changes to which english pp and pt have been subject over the centuries subsumed under the resultative  anterior  perfectivepast grammaticalization path these changes have been attested in genealogically and geographically distant languages in the world and have therefore been characterized as evolutionary universals as such they are motivated by common communicative and cognitive forces that are shared across diverse speech communitiesit has been argued that the first step of the grammaticalization of haveperiphrases that is from resultatives to anteriors is motivated by the relevancedriven inferential process with repeated use the meaning focus shifts from the resulting state to the past situation current relevance becomes a linguistically encoded component and its nature of current relevance extends from the persistence of targetstate results to other aspects of the discourse that can satisfy conventionalized expectations of relevance the next proposed step aoristic drift is for the anteriors to further develop into perfectives or pasts therefore the current relevance underwent gradual erosion until it became highly abstract and fully bleached each step of the grammaticalization path involves the generalization or broadening of a core conceptual element and accordingly a widening range of use meanwhile the synthetic past tense undergoes a functional narrowing the anterior value is lost first followed by perfectivitypastmarking functions in spontaneous speech and then by all other uses as it approaches the end of the pathby synthesizing the literature and surveying crosslinguistic evidence this chapter demonstrates that the above standard characterization requires further qualification although the changes are indeed crosslinguistically motivated they constitute only one probable scenario as opposed to a deterministic tendency examples that traverse the entire resultative  anterior  perfectivepast path concentrate in continental romance as for other languages predominantly indoeuropean with similar grammatical categories the picture is rather complexfirst it is possible for a language to remain in one state along the path for a very long time without showing signs of proceeding to the next this means that many languages can be positioned on different points along a continuum one end of which has the haveperiphrasis acting as a true resultative and the synthetic pt encompassing anterior perfective and past meanings type a and the other end has the haveperiphrasis as a perfectivepast and the pt on the brink of disappearance from everyday usage type e the five synchronic types postulated in this chapter represent prototypical instantiations of the functional configurations most surveyed languages including slavic germanic and many others belong to types acanother crucial finding of this chapter is that language may diverge from a welltravelled path and develop other patterns the cases of modern greek and some varieties of latin american romance deserve special attention because in these cases it is the pt that has undergone functional expansion andor frequency increase as members of type b these languagesdialects show considerable overlap between the two verb forms in encoding anterior values but not perfectivepast values to conclude all the above findings call into question whether the english pp and pt will also follow continental romance along the resultative  anterior  perfectivepast path while the first step of this path had been completed by the beginning of modern english it remains to be seen whether english also provides evidence though possibly in other forms for the second step aoristic drift

profitsociedad limitada de inters general sligunanimous voteintroductionthis chapter focuses on the benefit corporation regulatory phenomenon visvis spanish law spain has not passed specific provisions regarding benefit companies and to the date the legislature does not envisage any regulatory initiative in this field however legal scholars practitioners and private policy proponents have fostered the debate around hybrid company forms balancing profitmaking with the protection or enhancement of other notforprofit interests in spain entrepreneurs predominantly resort either to private companies limited by shares sociedades de responsabilidad limitada or sl or to a much lesser extent to public companies limited by shares sociedades annimas or sa historical and marketspecific factors explain why partnerships are not popular legal forms within the spanish business environment for this reason this chapter mainly focuses on benefit companies while leaving civil and commercial partnerships aside accordingly from a policy perspective the spanish legislature would rather lean towards a specificform approach by enabling benefit companies solely as a special form of private company this was the case of the sociedad limitada de inters general slig a failed legislative proposal on a benefit corporation for spain in this way the policy option was similar to the german proposal for a gesellschaft mit beschrnkter haftung in verantwortungseigentum this methodological approach deviates from the one taken by other jurisdictions such as italy or france where overarching benefit models have been envisionedon the academic side the discussion focuses on the applicable legal framework in which benefit  or simply notforprofit  companies shall appear this usually results in scholarly debates around core company law concepts namely the cause of the company contract the interest of the company and the directors duties towards it as well as shareholder protection visvis majority and managerial abuse and thirdparty interests on the practitioners side problems usually arise at the registration phase in spain the articles of association are subject to strict formal and material legality control by the commercial register registro mercantil for this reason provisions in the articles of association enabling hybrid purposes or giving directors leeway to consider other interests will be closely scrutinised sometimes resulting in denied access to the registertoday policymaking is mainly fostered by private actors upsocial a civil association based in barcelona put forward an initiative for a general interest private limited liability company sociedad limitada de inters general or slig in  their project was presented as a legislative proposal by the grupo parlamentario cataln convergncia i uni but was rejected by the lower chamber of parliament congreso de los diputados for years the proposal has gone almost unnoticed by company law scholars and only sporadic references within the social economy literature may be found from a company law perspective the legislative technique left room for improvement and included a large number of concepts that were familiar to social economy entities but foreign to private companiesin recent years the b lab spain foundation has set up a benefit certification system since   entities have been certified as bcorps after successfully adopting b lab spains guidelines including the active pursuance of a stakeholders interest typically workers the environment clients or local communities additionally  entities have signed up to have their socalled b impact assessed which again includes an evaluation of their governance worker environmental and local communities and clientrelated standards certification is granted only after introducing a number of amendments to the articles of association to include the interests of other stakeholdersthis chapter takes up on the emerging discussion as to whether benefit companies may be formed under spanish company law it points out the obstacles entrepreneurs may face to establish such a hybrid entity both from a theoretical perspective and in practical terms this is from the companys creation and throughout its life cycle it also compares this background against the proposals fostered by social advocacy actors such as upsocial and b lab in particular we provide a critical review on the slig proposal and we examine the amendments to the articles of association that certified b lab spain bcorps shall adoptlegal frameworkas noted above spain has not adopted any regulations on benefit companies and the only initiative of the kind was withdrawn in  for the purposes of exploring the formation of a benefit company under spanish law the following legal provisions shall be taken into account public and private companies are regulated under the real decreto legislativo  de  de julio por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la ley de sociedades de capital hereinafter lsc a comprehensive companies act however the act does not address the contract by virtue of which a company is formed contrato de sociedad which is referred to more general provisions contained in the spanish commercial code artt  lsc and  cdc commercial law provisions refrain from defining contracts which are also regulated under civil law instead they are confined to establishing the requirements under which such contracts are deemed commercial in nature as a result the definition of the company contract must be sought in the civil code art  cc the provisions deal exclusively with partnerships but these are the essential forms of business associations upon which the whole system is built partnership law namely rules regarding purely contractual aspects are default rules applicable to companies too artt  and  cdc for the sake of simplicity we refer to the contract giving rise to a company as a company contract notwithstanding the fact that the relevant provisions actually refer to civil and commercial partnerships the wording is not problematic in spanish since the term sociedad also designates civil and commercial partnerships sociedades civiles and mercantiles respectivelythe spanish contract law system was historically influenced by french law and this too is reflected in company law as other frenchinfluenced jurisdictions the cause is considered one of the three essential elements of a contract art  cc in the case of the company contract the cause is regarded as the aim to pursue profit in order to distribute it among shareholders as foreseen by artt  cc and  cdc civil and commercial partnerships are consistently defined as contracts where the parties members or partners share the common goal of pursuing profit and distributing it among themselves for years legal scholars and courts have led an intensive discussion as to whether companies may be formed in pursuance of nonprofitable goals in light of articles  cc and  cdcaccording to general understanding profit is a twofold concept and a distinction is usually drawn between objective profit and subjective profit many eu member states are familiar with this duality but the spanish debate was here strongly influenced by the italian academic discussion objective profit refers to the net positive economic result of the exploitation of an activity authors have sometimes fostered a broader understanding of objective profit as a mere creation of advantages for the members or partners subjective profit refers to the distribution of the latter among shareholders subjective profit is usually regarded as the key element upon which the distinction between forprofit and thirdsector entities is built the nondistribution constraint typically defines the scope of nonprofit entities benefit companies disrupt this paradigm their hybrid character goes beyond that of preexisting forms such as cooperative societies as can be noted the emergence of benefit companies also poses new challenges in terms of fundamental freedoms in the internal market since notforprofit entities fall out of the scope of freedom of establishment art  in relation to art  tfeu as the line between profit and notforprofit dilutes consistent policy adaptations will be requiredwithin this framework spanish scholars and courts have dealt with the role of profit within the concept of sociedad artt  cc and  cdc in line with other continental systems such as those of france and italy spanish policymakers have historically mistrusted private associations pursuing nonprofitable purposes this explains why regulations on both civil and commercial partnerships define them as business associations pursuing an economic goal today constitutions recognise the fundamental freedom of association art  of the spanish constitution ce and other related freedoms such as the right to own property art  ce the right to create foundations art  ce or the freedom of enterprise art  ce consequently reluctance towards nonprofitable organisations is no longer a policy reason to preserve the forprofit requirement since the s scholarly efforts have pushed for a broader understanding of the general concept of sociedad one in which profit is not an essential requirement but where any lawful common purpose is deemed sufficient these proposals are sustained by political systematic and comparative legal arguments and may today be considered the prevailing scholarly opinion among private lawyers they are further sustained by the fact that the legislature in aligned jurisdictions such as france or italy has already accepted a more flexible approach france added nuance to its strict forprofit requirement by introducing the need to consider environmental concerns and by enabling any socit to include a purpose statement italy introduced the societ benefit in  besides the dominant scholarly opinion usually shares the view that any remaining doubt has been solved by means of art  lsc a provision that is usually regarded as the final abandonment of the forprofit requirement for companies art  lsc establishes that private and public companies shall be deemed commercial in nature regardless of their objects objeto social the object refers to the activity undertaken by the company as expressed by the articles of association art b lsc it is different from the forprofit cause of the company contract usually referred as fin socialhowever it may be argued that the provision does not fulfill such an ambitious function first it ensures the applicability of commercial law provisions to companies notwithstanding any other consideration in other terms it establishes that companies qualify as merchants or businesspersons regardless of the type of activity they carry out second it suggests that companies may pursue their forprofit purpose by means of any lawful activity cualquiera que sea su objeto which again does not exclude or abrogate profit especially in a subjective sense in turn one could question whether an activity that cannot be feasibly expected to generate distributable profit could be chosen as part of the objects of a company meanwhile the courts have not entirely endorsed the extensive approach to the concept of company and tend to favour a blackletter interpretation of the law the administrative authority responsible for the commercial register the direccin general de los registros y del notariado dgrn now known as the direccin general de seguridad jurdica y fe pblica dgsjfp was also reluctant to accept the scholarlyfostered proposal this usually prevented registration of provisions in the articles of association which are directly or indirectly incompatible with the forprofit requirement in a recent decision of  december  the dgsjfp appeared to shift its traditional approach towards a more flexible view its position is grounded on the distinction between objective and subjective profit the dgsjfp granted registration of a company despite the fact that the articles of association foresaw that profit would not be distributed among shareholders thus abrogating subjective profit here the dgsjfp interpreted article  lsc in relation to article  cdc in the sense that only objective profit and not subjective profit must be deemed as part of the cause of the company granting registration of subjective notforprofit companies is a rather formalistic way of providing a practical solution to the increasing role of benefit or hybrid modelsaccordingly from a doctrinal perspective commercial partnerships and companies may as well pursue nonprofitable purposes on this basis scholars have envisaged nonprofit companies formed in accordance with spanish law these are companies in which profit is amended or even abrogated either in an objective or in a subjective sense or even completely additionally only sporadic references may be found with regards to hybrid entities in the scholarly literature partially profitseeking in nature and partially aimed at fostering other stakeholder interests however the worldwide regulatory trend of benefit companies has not gone unnoticed authors have typically assessed them in connection with either the interest of the company or corporate social responsibility issuesconcept and purpose of benefit corporationsbenefit companies are generally defined as hybrid company forms their hybrid character arises from the fact that they are partially forprofit and partially notforprofitoriented the notforprofit side builds on selecting one or more ideal or generalinterest purposes that the company purports to foster typically one or more specific stakeholders will be designated in the comparative framework legal provisions on benefit company models sometimes include a general definition of public or general interests followed by a nonexhaustive list of examples including reducing a certain negative impact or the enhancement or protection of certain groups entities or communities including artistic charitable cultural economic educational literary medical religious scientific or technological purposes art  comma  legge  dicembre  n  and  b delaware general corporation law most jurisdictions are familiar with this policy option based on enumeration through the law of foundations which typically foresees a similar list in the case of spain this can be found in art  of ley  de  de diciembre de fundaciones lfnotforprofit or ideal purposes are generally alien to company law under traditional forprofit models and must blend into the corporate entity under frenchinfluenced systems where the cause is essential to the contract the hybrid character of benefit companies will reflect on the cause profit artt  cdc and  cc should be pursued together with other ideal notforprofit or general interest goals more precisely in continental jurisdictions in which profit is still considered a core feature benefit companies are typically considered to bring nuance to subjective profit but not necessarily to objective profit by combining a profit with a general interest goal the company shall still be able to generate positive net income if a broader notion of objective profit is preferred instead the company will at least need to produce some kind of advantage or enough income to prevent it from being wound up and liquidated this would have an impact on subjective profit and may prevent distributions among shareholders which is extremely controversial de lege latathe main difference with purely forprofit companies will lie in the distribution of profits among shareholders in benefit companies earnings shall be allocated differently since the enhancement of a general or public benefit interest shall be balanced with the distribution of profits among shareholders benefit regulations enable allocation of company resources in a manner that is usually forbidden or extremely uncertain under traditional forprofit models the key policy change visvis forprofit forms lies with the possibility to assign resources both to the distribution of profits and to the enhancement of a social interest or a public benefit goal in turn a social interest is pursued in a similar way as in the nonprofit sector with the exception that the entity is not subjected to a nondistribution constraintin addition to modifying the cause of the contract other features of benefit companies shall reconcile with structural company law concepts under the italian model the public benefit or interest is part of the companys object objeto social as described above this refers to the activity by means of which the companys purpose cause or fin social is implemented and achieved and it is expressed in the articles of association art b lsc other jurisdictions include the general or public interest in the company by resourcing to the socalled raison dtre this concept is alien to traditional company law and may be introduced at the cost of legal certainty for instance the preamble of the loi pacte itself makes it clear the raison dtre does not coincide with preexisting notions of company law namely the cause fin social or the object of the company objet social the latter consists of mandatory mentions of the company contract or the articles of association as opposed to the raison dtre which may be voluntarily included in the articles art  of the french civil code this is followed by a provision enabling directors to pursue it art l french code of commerce a similar enabling provision for directors is also foreseen by systems that opt for an amendment of the objects of the company such as italys art  comma  legge  dicembre  n  the concept of purpose or raison dtre as it is understood by the benefit literature is also alien to the spanish tradition besides the comparative framework suggests that benefit companies may give rise to many different business models depending on the extent to which the public benefit or interest is actually embedded into the companys activity for this reason assessing a hybrid model from a spanish perspective would require prior identification of such theoretical modelsthe spanish slig proposal seemingly envisaged a combined system including both an amendment of the objects and a purpose provision it foresaw that the articles of association mentioned one or several activities among five alternatives art  lscplaaes these ranged from a developing an economic activity to reduce or transform a specific social need b providing goods or service to socially vulnerable collectives or individuals c or enhancing social opportunities for them d as well preserving and improving the environment e or collaborating with other social economy entities only the first alternative included a list of possible scopes of activity health education culture housing environment similar to the italian benefit model or the law of foundations art  lf article  lscplaaes foresaw that the articles of association should transcribe one or various of the aforementioned options this technique entailed a questionable restriction to freedom of contract within the articles presumably the transcription was not intended to prevent the articles from mentioning a specific stakeholder individual or collective or an economic potentially profitable activity that the company would carry out article  lscplaaes also mentioned a socalled compromiso estatutario referring to the founders commitment to create a general interest impact upon society this compromise in the articles of association may have been similar to an actual statement of purpose or raison dtre however the systematics of the provision made it unclear whether it actually simply referred to the object of the companybenefit corporation modelsup until this point the analysis shows that what is described as a benefit company may translate into several business models in other words a wide phenomenon may result from actually deploying company forms in pursuance of hybrid purposes models may vary depending on the way in which the public benefit is imbedded into the structure of the company this is one of the reasons why enacting benefit companies is technically challenging and also why the language tends to be inaccurate or generic accordingly we narrow down the potential outcome into three theoretical benefit corporation models our taxonomy relies on concepts arising from the nonprofit sector literature and appears consistent with recent developments in the law of benefit companiesfirst since de lege lata the purpose or raison dtre of a company is a concept alien to the spanish system we understand that an adaptation in this regard would have very little actual normative impact model  the companys policy documents may refer to a broader goal or purpose to which the company is committed typically the environment or the local communities affected by the activity it is sometimes the case that this kind of formulation appears in board regulations reglamento del consejo de administracin and is sometimes included in the articles of association such declarations would not typically affect the cause of the contract as long as the decision is within reason it will be assessed under the business judgment rule art  lsc additionally the scholarly understanding of the interest of the company is sufficiently broadly interpreted as to accommodate business decisions based on environmental or societal demands even from strict shareholdervalueoriented views in larger undertakings namely public listed companies one additional reason why such provisions have very little practical impact may correlate to the limited enforcement in continental public companiesthe second constellation designates benefit companies in which the protection or enhancement of the public interest is part of the daytoday activities of the company model  in this scenario the company would actively take up necessary or convenient action to foster their selected interest this would require directors to organise and allocate human and material resources namely financial resources in this scenario activities aimed at protecting or enhancing the public interest are not merely ancillary but are indeed sufficiently intense and prolonged in time to be a part of the objects of the company the spanish slig proposal took this approach by introducing specific amendments to the objects provision in the articles of association art  lscplaaesthis scenario could in turn be implemented in two different ways in the first alternative the enhancement of the general interest would require the company to use part of its resources to actively fund the social cause or stakeholder of their choice this would mean that funds generated by a profitable activity should be channeled to fund the nonprofitable purpose model a this way of operating is familiar to nonprofit law where it is generally referred to as a donative model modelo dotacional as opposed to donating funds to a nonprofit financial resources would not be diverted to a thirdsector entity but would be managed by the benefit company itself the benefit company would allocate them directly in favour of the social interest of their choice and by doing so the company would be accomplishing its objects however when assessing this model it must be borne in mind that the benefit regulatory phenomenon aims at overcoming a traditional donationbased system and some failures arising therefrom under this model the articles of association would typically include a socalled plural objects clause besides an enabling provision on distribution of profits may be neededthe second alternative would be one in which the only activity pursued by the benefit company effectively enhances or protects the social interest of its choice b under this model the benefit company mimics social economy entities instead of channeling part of its earnings to foster a social interest the forprofit activity itself would fulfil this function this could happen because the activity is undertaken in a specific manner as to achieve this goal or because the activity itself is suitable for it the main concern under this model refers to the financial viability of the activity which is usually sustained through the reinvestment of profits the spanish slig proposal seemed to be oriented towards this model see art  and  under plaaes since no distinction was drawn between different activities within the objects this modelbased division is not a clearcut one but an entity may rather combine different models or switch from one to anotherobstacles in the setup of benefit corporationsunder this section we explore the extent to which inforce spanish company law provides leeway for party autonomy to set up the different benefit corporation models described above here a distinction may be drawn between their theoretical admissibility and effective registration the cause or purpose of the benefit corporationas stated above setting up benefit companies under spanish law would require an adaptation of the cause of the company contract as to render it hybrid or dual wherever the legal system identifies the cause of a company contract with the pursuance of profit such an amendment is controversial spanish company law scholars regard it as admissible but courts are indeed reluctant however under spanish law the cause of the company contract is not part of the articles of association and need not be expressed in any relevant company law document contract or deed in fact only the objects of the company as a means to achieve the companys purpose cause are required to be in writing as a result such an abstract adaptation of the cause of the contract may not pose any practical problems at the setup another way forward could be seen in the fact that the courts but also the dgsjfp usually claim that the forprofit purpose shall prevail this assertion could be interpreted in the sense that as long as profit is not seriously compromised or completely abrogated a benefit or hybrid model may be compatible with our system on a different note member states may only provide for the nullity of a company on the grounds that the objects are unlawful or contrary to public policy art bii directive eu  and art e lsc since conditions for the nullity of a company must be narrowly interpreted the prevailing scholarly opinion shares the view that an unlawful cause even a notforprofit one does not call for the nullity of the companya forprofit cause does not prevent companies from making contributions or donations to charitable initiatives or other general interest objectives this kind of payments are usually considered lawful provided that they are merely auxiliary or marginal in the sense that they do not replace or hinder the regular business activities of the company consequently the allocated amount shall be reasonable such requirements are intended to protect minority shareholders rights namely those of an economic nature the right to receive distributed profits and the right to a share within liquidation in this line the articles of association may provide for the company to allocate a small part of its annual profits to fund general interest initiatives the fact that such decisions and their corresponding provisions of the articles of association are admissible de lege lata enables entrepreneurs to adapt existing company forms to some of the features of benefit corporations without any prior legislative reform objects of the benefit corporationas analysed above a number of jurisdictions require benefit companies to consistently adapt the provision in the articles of association regarding their objects this regulatory technique blurs the difference between the objects and the cause of the contract by gathering them in one single provision de lege lata the provision in the articles is only concerned with the former this is with the activity that the company carries out as a means to foster its purpose arts b lsc y  rrm in this light the drafting of the objects provision in a benefit model may be problematic the theoretical models described above may require the relationship between the forprofit and the notforprofit purposes to be formulated differently the same may apply to the various activities carried out to achieve each of them while models  and b may not raise concerns in this regard model a may require that the articles actually mention a nonprofitable activity in spain doubts typically arise as to whether the objects may only consist of economic activities scholars usually interpret art  lsc as enabling any lawful activity to be included in this provision cualquiera que sea su objeto yet courts and registrars tend to reject that the articles include activities that are presumed unfit to generate profit such as making donations or gifts  this approach on their part is incorrect because it entails an ex ante examination of the entire business model for which commercial registrars and even courts are illequipped besides donations are deemed economic in nature for the purposes of eu law at least with regards to free movement of capitalwhenever an economic activity is indeed carried out solely model b or within a donationbased model model a it shall be mentioned within the objects of the company this provision defines the scope of the directors actions from an internal perspective ex art  directive eu  art i and ii lsc the spanish slig proposal took this into account since a number of the alternatives foreseen by art  lscplaaes designated either the economic activity art a and c lscplaaes or the type of goods and services that would be distributed art b lscplaaes presumably founders would have had to replace the generic reference to an economic activity or product or service with the actual economic activity that the company undertook under model a the objects provision would mention both the forprofit and the notforprofit activity whenever the company carries out more than one activity a complex or plural objects provision may be foreseen complex objects provisions allow for an extension of the scope of activity at the risk of undermining the principle under which the objects should be sufficiently delimited in the articles art b lsc however the dgsjfp has a rather formalistic view and considers a provision to be in compliance with this principle as long as it mentions activities among the ones listed in the clasificacin nacional de actividades econmicas cnaewith regards to mentioning contributions to nonprofit organisations or donations within the objects two additional considerations can be made first in forprofit models donations are not usually part of the objects but rather auxiliary activities for this reason they typically need not be reflected in the articles second as a result of reluctance towards such a provision model a may confront more obstacles de lege lata than other alternatives this should not raise excessive concern since a similar result may be achieved through a provision regarding the distribution of profits on their turn b labs amendment to the articles with regards to the object advances a different approach one that is similar to art ii of the french civil code besides whatever activity the company may carry out a reference to the creation of a positive social impact namely on the environment shall be includedfinancefinancial aspects of benefit companies may also vary from one model to another typically regulations on the matter will balance the distribution of profits among shareholders with the encouragement of the general interest reflected in the articles this is usually pursued through a legal provision setting the percentage of distributable profits under the spanish slig proposal only  of profits beneficio could be distributed while  would have to be reinvested or dedicated to reserves art  lscplaaes an exception may be made if less than  of profits were distributed in the two preceding years art ii lscplaaes the proposal could be improved by clarifying the concepts of profits and reinvestment first such a provision should coordinate with article  lsc subordinating any distribution to prior covering of the legal reserves as well as reserves provided for in the articles of association and forbidding distributions which reduce net equity patrimonio neto under share capital consequently doubts arise as to whether the reinvestment quota would be calculated on the basis of distributable profits were this the case an express mention would have been advisable the interaction of this  allocation system with other provisions setforth in the articles additional reserves founders or shareholders preferential rights or directors remuneration based on profits may have also called for additional considerationbesides the meaning of reinvestment is controversial since the proposal itself foresaw it in opposition to covering reserves by opposing them article  lscplaaes diverged from article  of ley  de  de julio de cooperativas notforprofit cooperative societies may create a special reserve for nondistributable profits for reinvestment purposes which are intended to help the cooperative establish itself in the market and improve its services when opposed to covering reserves reinvestment would then be interpreted as actively dedicating resources to the enhancement of the notforprofit purpose this means that a large percentage of profits could potentially be extracted from the company every financial year if this were the case further clarification would be required in order to specify how profits should be reinvested in a way that ensures the enhancement of the general interest or the protection of individuals and collectives selected in the articles of association provisions in the articles shareholders instructions to directors art  lsc or simply a decision of the general meeting would be requiredin essence different forms of ex ante shareholder engagement could limit the risk of insider abuse in a model that provides a sort of carte blanche to allocate a large fraction of profits in activities and initiatives that may have only been vaguely described article  lscplaaes would also need to coordinate with art  bis lsc granting an exit right to shareholders in the event that profits are not sufficiently distributed here policy alternatives range from excluding the application of art  bis lsc in benefit regulations or narrowing its scope to profits that may be effectively distributed under benefit regulations  to leaving the matter to the articles of association according to art  bis lsc this exit right can be abrogated by the articles of association either after a unanimous shareholders vote or by granting an exit right to shareholders who voted against its exclusionunder current regulations scholars share the view that a fraction of annual profits may be allocated to social or general interest initiatives the dgsjfp agrees that the articles of association can foresee a provision of the kind for instance establishing a percentage subject to the same criteria that apply to donations this means only a small fraction of profits may be dedicated to notforprofit purposes in order to preserve the forprofit goal and the shareholders economic rights besides the dgsjfp arguably conceives these provisions as simply enabling but not necessarily binding for the ordinary general meeting when deciding on how annual results should be distributed art  lsc to our understanding this may depend on the wording of the provision which may be simply enabling or mandatory what is still controversial is the majority required to amend the articles of association in order to introduce it that is whether a unanimous vote is required or whether a qualified majority would sufficefurthermore as long as the notforprofit goal is formulated in wide terms the provision is not bound to create a thirdparty right to effectively perceive profit doubts may arise whenever the articles refer expressly to an organisation or to an individual for instance a foundation see also art b lscplaaes referring to individuals de lege lata the dgsjfp opposes the view that thirdparty rights may be created in this way the abovementioned considerations may reflect differently on the various business models a benefit company could adopt since model b includes the notforprofit activity as part of the objects one could argue that profits may be dedicated to it in the same way as to the forprofit activity model a on the contrary would typically rely on this kind of ex ante solutionsgovernanceas far as governance is concerned regulations on benefit companies typically assess directors duties and shareholder protection mechanismsdirectors dutiesbenefit regulations usually include a legal provision enabling directors to pursue the general interest or notforprofit purpose this typically includes a reference to the interest of the company which opts for a stakeholder approach and sometimes even departs from the maximization of shareholder value for italy art  comma  legge  dicembre  n  for the spanish slig art  lscplaaes under inforce spanish company law shareholder value is deemed compatible with the directors considering other stakeholders interests that if ignored or not properly accounted for may generate reputational damage or other sort of negative impact upon the company the latter may also be formulated positively as long as including stakeholder concerns is not detrimental to value creation the decision is protected by the business judgment rule assuming the decision is not immediately profitmaximising or requires longterm engagement it can still be deemed compatible with the interest of the company on the grounds of a longterm maximisation value approachamong others disregarding environmental and community concerns may push the decision away from the scope of the business judgment rule art  lsc this may happen because procedural prongs of the business judgment rule may not be fulfilled if the decision fails to adequately assess environmental or societal impact under art  lsc these are formulated as an adequate decisionmaking procedure and suitable information this approach is similar to what has been described as a benefit judgment rule provided that a wider range of potential decisions are available in order to reconcile profit and purpose and the directors are required to balance the different interests at stake scholars have suggested that the focus shall be placed on the procedural aspects of the decision rather than on the merits thereof this approach is sometimes criticised on the grounds that it provides excessive leeway for directors however one could question whether a decision that needs to balance several interests here the shareholders and the stakeholders rather than only one would actually allow directors to choose among a larger number of potential outcomes arguably in some cases the need to consider stakeholder interests would indeed narrow their options down legislative amendments to provide express authorisation for directors to consider stakeholder interest have sometimes been disregarded namely because they generate balancing costs for directors a similar assessment may be made with regards to the multistakeholder provision fostered by b lab one in which the interest of employees clients suppliers and other parties such as local communities the environment and both long and shortterm interests should be envisioned however scholars generally consider such provisions may be included on a voluntary basisshareholder protectionshareholder protection in benefit companies aims at ensuring that the companys essential features are not altered without shareholder consent or other adequate balancing mechanisms however the kind of concerns that arise when turning traditional forprofit company models into benefit corporations also reflects on the proper way to protect shareholders if the cause of the company contract is altered a unanimous vote is required this result is justified both from the perspective of company law and from that of contract law  under contract law provisions an amendment of the cause of the contract requires unanimous consent art  cc the result could also be achieved through company law provisions by conceding that the alteration of the forprofit cause directly affects an individual shareholder right art  lsc the right to participate in the distribution of profits art  lsc this second solution is slightly more controversial because it leads to an ongoing discussion on whether shareholders may forego this right ex ante it could nevertheless be argued that such an amendment of the cause will not abrogate or exclude the right to participate in the distribution of profits instead it would only lead to a reduction of potentially distributable profits directly affecting the right but not requiring shareholders to waive it the requirement is also considered to be applicable when the articles of association are amended to include a stakeholder interest provision if only the objects of the company are concerned a substantial amendment of the articles of association gives rise to an exit right art a lsc extending the scope of the objects by including a notforprofit activity model a provided that this option is admissible would qualify as a substantial amendment of the provision consequently the shareholders who opposed it would enjoy a sellout right or appraisalbenefit regulations usually foresee an exit right which is triggered by conversion of a forprofit company into a benefit one and vice versa  b  dgcl art  lscplaaes as it has been noted an exit right may be an adequate protective mechanism against amendments of the objects but insufficient if the companys structure is altered in a more significant way if a hybrid purpose is instated even if only an amendment of the articles is formally proposed a material change in the cause of the company may effectively take place and consistently every shareholders consent would be required only sporadically have authors considered that an exit right may sufficeregistrationthe obstacles that entrepreneurs may face in the process of registering a benefit corporation in spain have been assessed throughout the chapter as described these are usually derived from a strict registrar control which in turn is supported by the dgsjfps conception of profit as an essential element of spanish company law scholarly consensus on the need to overcome the forprofit requirement does not necessarily result in a successful registration of hybrid companies controversial issues at a registration state would typically include mentioning notforprofit activities as part of the objects and other provisions in the articles of association that are deemed incompatible with profitmaking such as provisions allocating a large fraction of earnings to nonprofit or general interest initiatives specific tax treatmentsince spain has not adopted specific regulations on benefit companies or similar hybrid models no specific tax treatment exists donations and other contributions to notforprofit initiatives by forprofit companies are tax deductible under company tax regulations public and private companies can benefit from this tax incentive however undertakings operating as sa and sl are excluded from the special tax regime foreseen for notforprofit entities only notforprofit entities and other organisations listed in article a lifm in relation to art  lifm may enjoy it extending it to benefit corporations formed as public or private companies would require prior legislative reform this claim is supported by benefit corporation advocates who have traditionally demanded tax authorities and policy makers to include forprofit companies operating in a sustainable stakeholderfriendly manner in the same tax regime as nonprofit organisations on its turn the slig proposal was largely concerned with tax benefits not only for the benefit company itself but also for socalled socialenterprise proximity investors art  plaais however their provisions were designed under a company tax regime that is no longer in force bibliographyalbiana garcaquintana m  el beneficio y su distribucin segn la ley de sociedades annimas rdm  alcal daz m a  el inters social en la sociedad

DWJCV_42_Response_to_JGMS-2020-RES-750_R2_edit__input.json,Response to reviewer comments,1972,0, 60,0,4,To the Editor: Associate Editor's comments Reviewers' comments Reviewers' comments,responses to reviewer comments manuscript id jgmsresrto the editorwe appreciate this opportunity to address the editors and reviewers comments and to revise our manuscript the authors thank the reviewers for their critical review comments and suggestions for improving the quality of our manuscript the following are our pointbypoint responses to the comments we have indicated our revisions in the manuscript with yellow highlights and red text all page and paragraph numbers refer to the locations in the revised manuscriptassociate editors commentsthe manuscript is improved but reviewers have identified some remaining concerns please address more fully in the discussion the limitations of the crosssectional design residual confounding inability to establish causality be sure early on in the discussion the results are put in perspective of this design please clarify the interaction testing and correct inconsistency in the covariates in the models model  in the text stat methods and tablesresponse thank you for your comments and your interest in this manuscript we have revised the manuscript in accordance with reviewers comments as detailed belowas recommended by the reviewer  we have additionally analyzed the results of incidence of sarcopenia and its components during twoyear followup periodwe apologize for the misprint we have replaced interaction effect between gdf levels andsarcopenia with interaction effect between gdf levels and sexfurthermore we have revised with consistency in the covariates in the models model  in the text stat methods and table reviewers commentsresponses to reviewer comments to the authorthe authors have tried hard to respond to my comments and the redone analysis did not significantly change the results which may support the model robustness of the previous analysis nevertheless some limitations remained unchanged gdf has been reported to be associated with individual diseases or agerelated conditions so the associations with sarcopenia are not surprising to me limitations remained still that a crosssectional design is not able to establish the causal relationship of these highly interrelated variables since kfacs is a longitudinal study i dont understand why the authors cannot provide longitudinal data to support the research hypothesisresponse thank you for your interest and your helpful comments we have revised the manuscript in accordance with your recommendationswe agree that longitudinal data to support our research hypothesis is necessary  as the reviewer pointed out the prospective cohort design of the kfacs included data collection every  years the first wave of baseline data collection started in  and the followup  has been currently finished and the year followup survey that will allow the requested longitudinal analysis is still in progresswe believe that the low incidence of sarcopenia due to the relatively short followup of  years were may not enough for predictors of incident sarcopenia in healthy older adult populations its because previous observational studies reported that biological markers were associated with incident sarcopenia and functional decline over  to  years followup period in older adults living in community hirani et al  kim et al  santanasto et al  therefore we considered that at least  years of followup data were needed and we will absolutely plan to measure gdf in serum taken in the year  survey and perform relevant longitudinal analysesas suggested we have additionally analyzed the results of incidence of sarcopenia and its components during twoyear followup periodplease see table swe have also revised all relevant sentencesspecific comments as followscomment  adjustment for cardiometabolic risk may consider using the number of components of metabolic syndrome which may cover reported items from the revised manuscript selecting the cardiometabolic risk for adjustment in this study did not process a systematic approach the authors selected those items based on their own definition some were using laboratory data but some were using the prevalence of diseasesresponse as suggested we have modified our analysis to include metabolic syndrome as adjustment variables in the logistic regressioncomment  think the title of the manuscript should be modified as elevated growth differentiation factor is a potential biomarker for sarcopenia in communitydwelling older adults using potential is a more reasonable terminology than usefulresponse we appreciate your comment on this crucial point as suggested we have revised the titlereviewers commentsresponses to reviewer comments to the authorthe paper is improved but there are still a lot of smaller issues that were identified i think these can all be addressed with a minor revisionresponse thank you for your interest and your helpful comments we have revised the manuscript in accordance with your recommendationscomment  abstract conclusion gdf has been implicated in other diseases therefore it is not clear if it is useful as a biomarker for sarcopenia per se as it would not be very specific to that condition this is concern is heighted given the discussion that suggests gdf could serve as a marker of biological age  it cant really be both a biomarker for biological age and also a biomarker for sarcopenia per seresponse we agree with your opinion however at this point our study confirmed that the independent relationship between serum gdf level and sarcopenia after adjusting for age and prevalence of diseases as confounding variables in crosssectional analysis  therefore we believe that gdf level may be considered a potential biomarker for identifying sarcopenia in older adults without renal dysfunctionfurthermore as recommended by the reviewer  we have additionally analyzed the results of incidence of sarcopenia and its components during twoyear followup period and we have revised the title as described belowcomment  introduction the phrase therefore it is important to employ a more comprehensive approach to characterizing complex pathophysiological mechanisms for sarcopenia doesnt really provide great justification for this paper when the focus is fairly simplistic eg an single biomarkerresponse thank you for your comment  to address this point we agree and have deleted this sentencecomment  introduction the rationale for the consideration of other biomarkers as covariate is not clear are these markers confounders are thy related to gdf if not why adjust for them the response didnt really clarify this issue which covariates are confounders and which may be mediatorsresponse we appreciate the important pointin fact we considered that adding other biomarkers ie myostatin dhea and igf levels as covariate to the model that intermediate factors or effects sarcopeniahowever we agree with the reviewer that other biomarkers as covariate is not clearto address this point we have deleted all relevant sentences furthermore we did not considered model adjusting for these biomarkers as covariate variables in multivariate logistic regressioncomment  methods the statement about followup data being unavailable is a bit unusual consider omittingresponse thank you for your comment  we have deleted this sentencecomment  methods the paper states that both dxa and bia were used to estimate appendicular lean mass it is unclear when which measure was used in the analysis and technically bia measures fat free mass not lean mass this should be clarified or the reference to bia omittedresponse thank you for your commentsas the editor suggested we have included more detail on our reasons for selecting the biomarker sample from the whole cohort sample in the methods section body composition was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis n   in two community health centers and  individuals underwent dualenergy xray absorptiometry dxa in eight hospital centerswe agree and have revised the manuscript as described belowcomment  methods it is unclear what is meant by the statement systematic differences have been reported in the regional bodycomposition measurement between the two types of dxa instruments bia is not the same as dxa  these are very different technologies it would be clearer if the authors did not mention bia at all and just said that lean mass was measured by dxa if that is indeed what was done for these analysesresponse thank you for your commentswe have mentioned technical differences of the dxa instruments hologic vs gehealthcare lunar systems as described belowa total of  participants underwent dxa using instruments from hologic and gehealthcare lunar systems at eight university hospital centers systematic differences have been reported in the regional bodycomposition measurement between the two types of dxa instruments modlesky et al  shepherd et al comment  methods there is a lot of controversy in the literature about the assessment of myostatin given its high sequence homology with gdf what is the evidence that the assay used in this study measured gdf without crossreacting to gdfresponse thank you for your comment we agree and did not include myostatin gdf data in analyses of our studycomment  methods it is unclear why models  and  were both run why not include all covariates in the same model were some factors thought to be confounders and others to be mediators this should be clear in the textresponse thank you for your comment  we believe this point is in line with comment we did not considered model  adjusting for these biomarkers as covariate variables in multivariate logistic regressioncomment  results some of the information in the first paragraph could be omitted as it is in the table already eg mean age in the tertiles  in fact the results could be simplified considerably by not repeating the numbers from the tablesresponse thank you for this suggestion we have deleted sentence of mean age in the

EHNZY_2_Response_draft_2_input.json,Response to reviewer comments,1594,0, 41,14,1,S9. Wireless signal transmission,response to reviewer  commentsthe authors have presented a new technical approach for biosensing applications by considering the change of the surface potential to the change of frequency overall i found the article is well written and organized the results are clear and easy to understand and the conclusion strongly supports the claim of the proposed sensing approach although this approach is highly versatile i doubt that it will have significant limitations when detecting realtime biomolecular interactions eg antigenantibody binding detection of real time biomolecular interaction involves much complex environment such as a ph neutralspecific ph buffer solution receptortarget analyte chemical kinematics etc which may induce significant noise in the system thus i would recommend if the authors can provide some further insights on how to filter out specific noises either by real time experimental demonstration such as using a mixed ph solution or by comprehensive qualitative discussionsresponse we appreciate the reviewer for the valuable comments as the review pointed out the noise induced from interfering biomolecules present in serum and blood is a problem for detecting realtime biomolecular interactions a passivation step is required to overcome this issue remaining binding sites on the sensor surface should be blocked by passivation materials such as bovine serum albumin bsa and polyethylene glycol pegrevision to discuss the realtime biomolecular interactions we added the following paragraph to the revised manuscriptit is possible to detect biomolecular interactions in real time if the sensing electrode is functionalized with receptors to capture target biomolecules however nonspecific binding of interfering biomolecules present in serum and blood generates noises to deteriorate detection sensitivity to prevent nonspecific binding on the sensing electrode the remaining binding sites on the surface are generally blocked by a bovine serum albumin bsa solution huanganal chem tarasovacs sens in addition tailoring the sensor surface with a polymer polyethylene glycol peg can further reduce nonspecific signals from interfering biomolecules owing to the hydrophilic peg on the surface which enables realtime immunodetection in whole serum gaopnas tarasovacs sensresponse to reviewer  commentsthe authors demonstrate a fetbased biosensor with oscillating readout signals which may be compatible with neuromorphic applications overall the circuit design of the biosensor is interesting they successfully used an arduino board to show the oscillation signals from the ph sensing which is potentially applicable for realtime monitoring therefore i suggest to accept this work after minor revisionthere are a few points which may improve this workthe authors used cdube for both ntype fet and ring oscillator is this information correct how come they use the chip to demonstrate two different functionsresponse we appreciate the reviewer for the valuable comments two different cdube devices were used for the readout transistor and ring oscillator please see the two cdube devices inside the red boxes highlighted in figs a and b as below the ring oscillator arrangement using cdube was provided in supplementary materialsrevision to clarify the experiment method we added the following paragraph to the revised manuscripttwo separate cdube devices were used to construct the readout transistor and the threestage ring oscillator the ring oscillator arrangement using cdube was provided in supplementary materials fig sbthe authors only measure ph  to  for the demonstration of their circuit how about the more basic or acid conditions areeg ph   or  the authors should clarity the range of the ph values which their circuit can measureresponse tarasov et al analyzed that the surface potential as a function of ph shows a sigmoid or sshaped curve where the surface potential is deviated from a linear slope at the most basic or acid conditions reftarasov this phenomenon is getting severe as the total number of surface sites is reduced since the total number of surface sites is a material property good selection of the sensing material is a primary step to improve the linearity of the ph sensitivityalthough we simply measured a small range of ph  to  to demonstrate surface potentialcontrolled oscillation the alodeposited sensing electrode could detect a wider range of ph  to ph  as confirmed in the ph sensing characteristics of our previous study see the figures below

be linearly converted to the oscillation frequency since the allowed input voltage for linear frequency conversion is larger than the maximum voltage signal generated from the sensing electrode our sensor is expected to measure the ph response of the alo surface over the ph range from  to revision to clarify the range of the ph values which our sensor can measure we added the following paragraph

the wireless signal transmission is preferred it will be better if the authors briefly describe how to make a wireless setup for their arduino boardresponse we appreciate the reviewer for the valuable comments we can make the wireless setup in an inexpensive and simple way by using the bluetooth module and the smartphone application by connecting the bluetooth module to the arduino sensing data can

manuscript and have made the correctionsrevision the misprints were corrected in the revised manuscriptalternatively increasing the supply voltagema please briefly discuss the temperature stability of the sensorresponse since the surface potential of the sensing electrode can be described with the nernst equation which is a function of temperature it is expected that the ph sensitivity of the sensing electrode depends on the temperature the measured ph value should be further compensated by considering the temperature of the test solutionrevision to address the temperature stability of the sensor we added the following paragraphs to the revised manuscriptit is expected that the ph sensitivity depends on the temperature because the surface potential  of the sensing electrode can be described with the nernst equation where k is boltzmanns constant t is the absolute temperature q is the elementary charge  is the ion activity of the solution and  is the ion activity at the point of zero charge in our previous study the alodeposited electrode generated  mvph at  c  k and  mvph at  c  k where the improvement in the ph sensitivity by  is similar to the nernst equationderived calculation by  jnn the similar temperature dependence on the ph sensitivity has been reported elsewhere reftarasov this temperature instability should be further compensated in a readout circuit by measuring the temperature of the test solutionop section  is in fact ok but seems to me poorly presentedas far as i understand it is the change in threshold voltage vt not surface potential or vlg

be expressed in term of a more appropriate parameter threshold voltage vt instead of vlgrevision the following has been modified in section      where   dvtdph is the ph sensitivity of the alo sensing layer caused by a change in surface potential based on the phsubsequently the second term in eq  can be calculated by taking the derivative with respect to vt as follows reftextbookwhere vt is the threshold voltage of the ring oscillator it is noteworthy that the ring oscillator has the same initial threshold voltage as the readout transistor because the same ntype transistors cdube texas

the unselected comments will also be corrected in the cameraready version thank you very much in advance for spending your time on our manuscript againit would be interesting to see a perclass analysis ie a per differencetype analysis of the  mentioned in sec  which ones are better modeled by the method whythank you for your interest and question the proposed method can accurately model the difference in event sounds such as dog chirping bird thunder footsteps car horn and church bell on the other hand it does not perform well for background sounds rain and carpassing as a reason vggish in the audio encoder is pretrained by the audio tagging task so the feature output from vggish is trained to focus on the foreground sound and it may not be able to handle the information about the background sound wellthe sentences at the end of  and  could be rephrased in a softer way you show that it seems to be like in your experiments but using a synthetic dataset with a limited number of conditions in a pretty controlled scenario while promising the proposed method may not be that good in a more realworld situationthank you for your suggestion we are going to modify the end of  and  in cameraready version as followingsthus in the synthetic dataset with a limited number of conditions the proposed method adjusted the range of the retrieval by introducing the text querymodifiertherefore the proposed method is expected to be able to use the difference information about event sounds in the scene which is different from the training datadear reviewer athank you

we select and reply only to the comments that are seemed important the parts pointed out by the unselected comments will also be corrected in the cameraready version thank you very much in advance for spending your time on our manuscript againhowever the experiments are conducted on the dataset set constructed by synthesis which makes the results not so convincingyour claim is right the dataset was constructed by synthesis the experiments in our manuscript are still early stage but we confirmed that the proposed framework performs ina simple taskon the other hand the data available online includes audio signals recorded outdoors audio signals synthesized on computers such as electronic instruments and audio signals created by processing and mixing multiple audio signals such as the apwd dataset when creating a work that includes sound such as video the desired audio signal is searched for from the vast amount of data available online and used in the production considering the production process described above we think that there is some value in evaluation using the synthesized datasetdear reviewer thank you very much for reviewing our paper our responses to the reviewers

the parts pointed out by the unselected comments will also be corrected in the cameraready version thank you very much in advance for spending your time on our manuscript again the authors only tested on the synthetic data consisting of limited events and acoustic scenes this prevents us from better understanding the robustness and generalization ability of the model what will happen if testing on an eventrich or acoustic scenerich dataset is the trained audio encoder robust enough to reject many prosaic sounds and nonrelated eventswe havent tried any eventrich dataset yet however section  has some results reflecting robustness and generalization in the experiments in this section two events that are not used in the training data are included in the test data for each scene table  shows that the performance of the model for events that are not included in the training data is reduced while the performance for events that are included is similar to table  therefore we think that the model is robust to situations where there are unrelated acoustic events in the candidates more detailed experiments are future work to make the experimental story more complete i suggest the authors could consider  examine the performance of the audio encoder described in fig  when not using a text query examine the model performance when using freeform text like the text without clear meaning the text mentions scenes and events not seen in the trainingthank you for your suggestion we are going to modify this part with your suggestion in particular the experiments with data including events and scenes not seen in the training will be important to understand the proposed method

insightful comments and discussions study methodologyi study design r rthe study is a twoway mixed design the betweenparticipants factor is the amount of current and the withinparticipants factor is the presenceabsence of current a total of  trials were conducted for each user  current conditions ngvs and control x  curvature gain conditions          x  trials we didnt inform the participants of the experiments intention beforehand and the order of conditions in the study was randomized well clarify these in user studyii participants r rwe recruited  participants and   females and  males of them completed the experiment since it was difficult to secure a sufficient number of participants with a balanced gender profile under the covid situation as r pointed out there is a possibility of gender bias in threshold and vr sickness well mention this issue as a limitationiii sample size rsince the previous study had  participants steinicke et al  we thought that a total of  participants  for each condition would be just enough to investigate the effect of our proposal however as r pointed out the number of participants is small so that we will mention it as a limitationiv compare to the control condition rthe following items can be compared between the experimental and control conditions from the experimental design the detection threshold calculated from the psychometric function and the subjective rotation sensation repeatability rthe gvs device that we used does not have a product number because it was developed based on  by ourselves well explain the implementation of the device in more detail references r rwe appreciate r and r for introducing the related papers we will discuss them in related work we also appreciate r for proofreading the text on the study of sra et al we will revise the text also in response to rs comment although we cannot directly compare our results with previous studies due to the difference of devices and ves we used we improved the effect of curvature gain by  compared to the control condition without ngvs in this study technical correctness rwe will clarify the differences by citing the previous studies r pointed out we will also add explanations of electrical stimulation and sensory integration which may be unfamiliar concepts to the ismar community writing and organization r r r rwe are sorry for the missing references in several places we will correct the misuse of conjunctions and revise the manuscript for r fig  shows a conceptual diagram of sensory integration based on maximum likelihood estimation the vertical axis shows the probability and the horizontal axis shows the curvature of the walking path in this case in sec  whidht should be weight we thank r for pointing out the copypaste error in sec  the first sentence has been corrected to  maresponse to other commentsr specifics of spatial perceptionwe focused on the perception of selfmotion in spatial perception previous studies have shown that selfmotion perception is achieved by integrating visual information from the optical flow and vestibular information from the vestibular organs fetsch et al  bremmer et al  chen et al  well revise intro to clarify thisr how rdw induces inconsistency between visual and vestibular signalsrdw makes us feel as if walking in a straight line in ves although turning in real space in that case visual information from the optical flow and vestibular information from the vestibular organs are inconsistent we will revise to clarify thisr how adding more weight to the visual data will solve a problemthe effect of rdw can be improved by reducing the contribution of vestibular perception and making the integrated perception more like a visual inputr if the authors believe visual manipulations in curvature gain can cause greater head sway and that in turn causes the vestibular signals not to match the visual signals resulting in user discomfort then that connection needs to be made clearer and supported by evidencewe believe that the centrifugal force generated by walking along a curved path has a greater effect than head sway a previous study indirectly suggests this that walking speed affects the threshold of curvature gain  well revise intro to clarify thisr why were the responses invertedwhen the curvature gain is applied the direction of rotation in the vr space and the direction in which the user actually walks are reversed the participants who gave the opposite answer misunderstood the intention of the question so their answers were reversed we will mark those who answered the opposite answer in tab r right dominant foot  how was this establishedbased on melicket al  we asked the participants if you would shoot a ball on a target which leg would you use to shoot the ball we will add this informationfor r we used point likert scales ranging from  to  in sec  we will revise to clarify thisr what is the mathematicalnumerical reason the gain sensitivity becomes lowhigh when the noise level is belowabove thresholdthe stochastic resonance sr phenomenon is known to have a unique sr response curve where the sensitivity of the sensory organs increases once at the optimal noise level and decreases again at excessive noise collins et al  its also known from sensory integration models that sensory inputs contribute to perception based on their reliability  therefore it is possible to suppress awareness of curvature gain by reducing the discrepancy between vision and vestibular sensation by reducing the reliability of vestibular sensation in spatial perception by providing noise gvs that is more excessive than the stochastic resonance phenomenonr what do you mean by it was suggested that the minimum perceptual threshold existed in the range how are minimum perceptual thresholds defined what are the tasks of the pilot studyin a preliminary experiment with  participants the threshold for noticing electrical stimulation on the skin varied among the participants still it was within the range of    ma and this value is consistent with the values of current density given in the previous study  we will revise sec  to clarify thiswe thank r for summarizing the main points of the discussion on safety and ethics gvs has been used in many studies and has been shown to be safe meanwhile for safety reasons gvs cannot be used in patients with pacemakers or epilepsy we will add a discussion of these safety and ethical restrictionsonce again we thank all reviewers and look forward to their responses

comments to author it is very interesting article but the authors should work harder on it in this from i do not recommend for publicationreplywe are grateful for your attentive review and we agree this paper does not cover entirely new content in ndt techniques for frp moreover as mentioned some of the results here look like similar to the previous studieshowever we did literature reviews of over    papers and then we designed the experiment entirely new and fabricated the specimens for the tests made  different gfrp panels prepared  specimens and investigated about  ultrasonicswe sincerely respond to your comments and look forward to improving the situation in my opinion the title of the article is exaggerated in relation to the content of the article title promises marine composite structures which for me is ship boa t et c and it turns out that the article is about samplesreplythank you for your comments we discussed it and decided to revise the title as the followingeffect of high glass fiber content and reinforcement combination on pulseecho ultrasonic measurement of composite ship structures i think the author should work more on literature part because in my opinion they missed the articles where you can find also other ndt techniques in application to real marine structures under normal operational conditions eg prof wieslaw ostachowicz s teamreplyfollowing your advice we have added four references     to the appropriate parts of the text including prof ostachowicz thanks againregarding health care monitoring it must be a very popular technology however the frp marine industry faces a real challenge that is difficult to apply making the design thicker and longer life is a realistic solution now thats why nondestructive testing is also difficult also we chose this topic however in the future it is correct to consider the operational situation you mentioned in real time and we found prof ostachowiczs paper about that thank you also the authors reported some similar works in previous years which can be foun d here in citation       some of them are in korean it is hard to state what is new and what is a kind of duplication of previous research the authors explanation is welcomedreplyreferences are summarized in the text but that might be insufficient additional explanations for each reference and the relationship to this paper are as followsreference  is an article for the introduction to frp ship design and fabrication not a paper to explain frp ship design this article introduces the relationship between the amount and strength of frp from the material design point of view of frp and the characteristics of new materials such as carbon fiber and environmental issues of frp are introducedreference  is a paper on the importance of lightweighting the frp structure a new method is proposed to apply the lifecycle assessment method to ships and as a result weight reduction is being emphasized in frp structure designreference  was the earliest study for this kind of research of my team the accuracy of the ascan result was measured according to the frequency difference of the probe and a more accurate probe frequency was investigated on the gfrp hull plate it is pretty basic than this study and the hull specimen is also completely differentreference  is optimal design of the hull plate of a ship subjected to the same amount of pressure at this time not only the theoretical gfrp design background but also the change in the strength of the gfrp plate according to the change in the amount of glass content are considered the experiments have shown that high glass content can have high strength but not always the cause is suggested by defects such as voids this paper does not deal with the correlation between glass content and voids generation as in this paperreference  compares and evaluates the method for accurately measuring the glass content of gfrp hull plates such as pleasure boats and fishing boats among the methods proposed by iso and asme and those suggested by the rules of the classification society the most accurate method is demonstrated through demonstration this paper is measuring fiber content using the burnoff test which has the highest accuracy among them according to the results of reference ref  presented the initial results of this study at a conference the research results on the same specimen or the analysis of the research results are not detailed as in the chart of the submitted paper and do not contain the contents of the discussion sectionthere has not been much research on the material design of frp ships also there are not many studies on ultrasonics that target these composite ship structures on the other hand the authors have been working steadily on this subject and for this study hull plates of various conditions were produced and the effect of the amount of glass fiber on the ultrasonic wave was investigated by applying the experimental method obtained through the existing researchonce again a large number of relative papers including authors papers have been reviewed for the jmse submission and that efforts have been made to obtain new results hope these additional explanations will work the authors should highlighted what is the motivation and goal of these studies why it is important how these studies are significant for science how these studies are similar different from others researchers the descriptions of figures should be more detailed also some conclusions or summation near every are welcomedreplyship structures made of glass fiberreinforced polymer gfrp composite laminates are considerably thicker than aircraft and automobile structures and more likely to contain inner defects such as voids the production characteristics mainly produced by hand layup also increases the possibility of defects in order to overcome these design and fabrication characteristics fiber combining or more fibers has been usedin this study a prototype was produced considering these characteristics and ultrasonics were used to measure their quality in this paper materials and specimen designs widely used in actual gfrp ship manufacturing were applied and we tried to prove the actual phenomenon of this material design and fiber combination these contents and results are described in the

would like to thank the reviewers for their assistance with the article their recommendations have been included in the revised manuscriptto reviewer comments to the authorthe authors present threshold voltage shift data after stress and consequent recovery of algangan hemts with sin passivation the authors make some claims in terms of capturingrecombination in certain trap levels which cause their hes stressrecovery model to line up with their data unfortunately more evidence ie indepth experiments needs to be presented in order to prove the validity of the model my main concerns are the followingq in tcad simulations the authors have implemented a sheet of buffer charges at a depth of nm into the gan channel what is the physical relevance of this do you expect a sheet charge at this level in the gan layer does it for example correspond with an interface between the gan and the rest of the buffer layers can this effect not be simulated using a uniform density of charge statesreplythank you for your comment from the previous studies the existence of defects in gan buffer due to the dislocation and other possible reasons during the epitaxy process has been proposed rr for example the active energy of gan buffer dislocation is about  ev in addition there are cdoped buffer defects existing due to carbon interstitials which the active energy is about  ev the distribution of defects is full of the buffer as shown in rin our study we simulate the result by setting electrons in the  nm depth under the channel however no matter electrons trap in  nm or other depth in the buffer the same result will be observed we also use a uniform and nonuniform density of electrons in the buffer to simulate we put  cm electrons in the whole buffer to simulate the uniform density besides in order to simulate dislocation defects we also decrease the density of electrons from  cm near the bottom of buffer to  cm near the top of buffer because the dislocation is severer in the bottom buffer than top buffer for these two situations we also obtain the same result which is shown in figure r and it can also confirms our model again the conduction band will increase due to electrons refilled in buffer defects and cause the vt continuously shifts in the positive direction during the recovery in our origin content we just use the  nm depth electrons trapping to represent that there are electrons refilling buffer defects and leads to the vt shifts during the recovery we has already focused on this part and revised the description in our

facts which you descriobe are not really novel or surprisingreplythank you for your comment first the misgan hemt is widely applied in high power and high frequency devices in addition during a hardswitching operation the device will suffer a severe degradation under the semion state moreover due to the unavoidable buffer defects generated during the epitaxy process it is also noteworthy and necessary to research the effect of buffer defects during the semion state operation thus it is important to research the degradation mechanismthere are few studies observed this abnormal vt shifts continuously during the recovery and explained the degradation mechanism in our study we propose a novel physical mechanism to explain this phenomenon and verify it by nbs and hes with illumination recovery moreover we also use silvaco simulation to confirm our model most studies consider that the main reason of the degradation under semion state is due to the trappingdetrapping of electrons in sinalgan interface however we first propose that holes generated by impact ionization under semion stress will recombine with the trapped electrons in the preexisting buffer defects and there are also electrons trapping in sinalgan interface during the recovery electrons will refill the buffer defects and cause the abnormal phenomenon that vt shifts continuously during the recoveryfinally we

research the authors assumed that circular part should be placed at bottom side and flat part should be at upper side the reader may wonder if circular part and flat part can be reversed and what will be the effectanswer to the reviewer   comment first thank you for your comments we have considered the further experimental study of the different orientation of semicircular tube comparisons between the results of current study and results of reversed arrangement when flat plate is positioned in the direction of gravity will be done in future works along with the further experimental

pipe a diameter of mmreviewer   commentcan the heat transfer phenomenon in the mm diameter of the test section be applied to the mm diameter semicircular channel of general pche if applicable please explain in detail whyanswer to the reviewer   comment first thank you for your comments we have considered the tube size effect before the conducting the experimental studywe had conducted a circular tube experimental study horizontal flows of co at supercritical pressure using circular tube  inch inner diameter  mm as a previous study r we analyzed that heat transfer in a horizontal tube represents different behaviors at top and bottom walls and buoyancy and bulk flow acceleration which are induced by drastic variation of properties are major reasons for such a differenceas a further work of circular tube experiments we wanted to study what happens when applied to the actual shape of the heat exchanger especially pche therefore as the results of the circular tube d  mm experiments were already secured the semicircular tube experiment was planned the diameter  mm semicircular tube was selected for direct comparison with the results of the circular tube experimenthowever as mentioned reviewer comment the width diameter of channel of pche is  mm thus before the conducting the experimental study of semicircular tube we conducted the literature survey and analyze for the diameter size effect at supercritical pressure cofirst we have organized the parameters for pche operating conditions about pressure temperature flow direction horizontal flow heat flux mass flux

circumferential direction how much do the authors think this asymmetry will affectanswer to the reviewer   comment in case of heat transfer of single channel the fluid in the channel is heated by a uniform heat flux on the wall as shown in fig aa however the inner channel of pche has a continuous stacking arrangement of hot plates and cold plates therefore boundaries in pche crosssections can be defined for the thermal design of pche as shown in fig ab unlike the single channel it does not receive the same heat depending on the location of an inner wall of channel in pche heat transfer of channels of pche are affected by conduction length depending on the plate thickness thus the difference between the two conditions is exist and the effects of asymmetry on pche inner channels will

considerable comments and valuable points based on the very helpful comments we were able to strengthen our manuscriptreviewer  the manuscript by kim and choo studied the mechanisms behind the differential sensitivity of striatum and cortex regions to mitochondria toxin np an inhibitor of mitochondria complex ii and a potent inducer of ros production applying different assays in multiple systems including in vivo mouse brain brain sections and cultured neuroblast na cells they evaluated the ros production and cell death jnkmediated stress response and autophagy readout in np treated samples the results showed a significant difference in mitochondriaderived ros production and autophagy response between the striatum and cortex tissues which the authors suggested as the potential underlying causes of the selective vulnerability of the striatum under np assault and in other pathogenic conditions such as different neurodegenerative disorders including huntingtons diseasethe mechanisms underlying the selective neuronal vulnerability among different brain tissues is an important and unanswered question especially in studying different brain degenerative diseases this study is trying to addressing this question by focusing on differential neuron death induced by toxin np the assays they employed are quite extensive and the findings potentially interesting if not too surprising the study potentially has sufficient interest especially for neurodegenerative fieldresponsewe appreciate the careful suggestions we have comprehensively addressed the issues raised by the reviewers a detailed pointbypoint response to all comments as followingsmain suggestionsi one main finding is that blocking ask activation by nqdi can reverse or suppress many of the toxic np effect given that such chemical inhibitors often have offtarget effect it would be prudent to test additional ask inhibitors and see if the similar effects can be achieved similarly it would be more convincing if genetic approach can be applied such as by knockdown by sirna or knockout by crispr of ask or other player in the jnk pathways in na cells or in primary neurons and examine for the similar suppression effectresponsethank you for important suggestion actually we want to inhibit mapkinase signal transduction by masking activity of mapk not by downregulating protein level in this study and we used the kinase inhibitor nqdi we have been studied on np infused mouse model and ask was downregulated by sirna in previous several studies   probably it made us skip this genetically inhibition of ask we agreed with that this is definitely convincing and supportive results for this study as commented we inhibited ask with sirna in na cells and determined that jnk the downstream mapkk of ask mapkkk was also inhibited by ask inhibition the results were shown in supplementary figure s newly added because we focused on the blocking activity of ask through this studyii based on the results it is not clear how autophagy plays any role in the np induced toxicity is it a secondary effect or a contributing factor to the cell loss the results did not answer this question at all only suggesting potential autophagy change although it is not necessary to address this question in this paper which is out of the scope of this manuscript it is important to discuss the data and this issue more clearly in the final discussionresponsewe appreciate the reviewer positive comments we are aware that our study lacks the mechanistic link between np induced toxicity and autophagy we also agreed with that this is important and we thank to your comments according to our present study there was difference of mitochondriaderived ros amounts between the striatum and the cortex of the np infused brain fig  it means mitochondrial damage is much severer in the striatum than in the cortex which there are many cargos to be handled by autophagy however autophagic function was reduced rather in the np infused striatum contrast to the cortex we think that these conditions ie increased cargo but decreased autophagy fundamentally caused striatal cell death autophagic dysfunction was regarded as one of main pathomechanisms in many neurodegenerative diseases including ad pd and hd it has been approached to enhance autophagy function in the brain cells located in each neurodegenerative brain subregion these aspects need to be studied in detail in the future and we have investigated the specific roles of autophagy in neurodegenerative disease hd and we prepare to submit the resultsin that point as commented this issue was added in the discussion of revised manuscript as followings with references  page  line from  in our present study there was difference of mitochondriaderived ros amounts between the striatum and the cortex of the np infused brain as shown in the figure  it means mitochondrial damage is much severer in the striatum than in the cortex which there are many cargos such as mitochondria to be cleared by autophagy however autophagic function was reduced rather in the np infused striatum contrast to the cortex these conditions ie increased cargo but decreased autophagy could be fundamentally caused striatal cell death in the present study autophagy molecules were differently regulated in brain subregions by np damage autophagic dysfunction was regarded as one of main pathomechanisms in many neurodegenerative diseases including ad pd and hd  it should be approached to enhance autophagy function in the brain cells located in each neurodegenerative brain subregion it needs to be studied in detail in the future and we have investigated the specific roles of autophagy and different treatment regulating autophagy in neurodegenerative disease hd modeliii similarly page  discussion the present results suggest that p is needed to eliminate other cargos to ensure survival there is no data in this manuscript supports this statement at all as a readout of autophagy higher levels of p mostly likely suggested reduced autophagy activityresponsethe mentioned part of the manuscript was trying to introduce the general p role in autophagy particularly in neurodegenerative diseases which show characteristics such as abnormal protein aggregates and brain region selective neuronal loss however the sentence says like as describing our data as pointed in revised manuscript we deleted the sentences and added the revised part as responded abovepage  lne page  line  the present results suggest that p is needed to eliminate other cargos to ensure survival in the present study autophagy molecules were differently regulated in brain subregions by np damage it suggests to needs for different treatment regulating autophagyiv for many experiments the time points analyzed need to be specified see below as wellresponsewe appreciate reviewers careful comments we added the timepoints in the revised manuscript including figure legends where missingother specific suggestions figure  the time points of the data collected for d e  g should be specified are they from day  or day given that one important finding

striatumresponsethe graph in the figure d showed cleaved caspase in the brain samples prepared from each time point such as day  and day  after np infusion the figure e and g did not specified as pointed and we added the time point as day  in the figure legends of revised manuscript figure fig aca time cause analyze for jnk and bdnf response should similarly be provided especially for the

added the additional supplementary file in the revised submission and listed the information including the catalog number of the antibodies used in this study in the supplementary table reviewer  in this manuscript authors have studied the selectively striatal cell loss in systemic nitropropionic acid np infused mice they showed that mitochondrial dysfunction was higher in the striatum than in the cortex and mitochondriaderived ros levels were higher in the striatum which was responsive for neuronal loss further they suggest that regulated autophagy may restore mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal loss in the striatum it is an interesting study however minor revision is required before it is accepted for publicationresponsewe appreciate the reviewers positive comments authors did not show striatal neurodegeneration and quantified it fig authors are suggested to show such data and compare it with cortexresponsethank you for the important suggestion as pointed this is fundamentally important basis for this modelactually we have been studied on np infused mouse model and striatal degeneration had been shown in our previous reports and quantified we confirmed striatal neurodegeneration by cresyl violet that is staining nissl body of the neuronal cells we provided the result in supplementary figure s authors have not studied the oxidative markers like lipid peroxidation and the activities of the antioxidant enzymes sod and catalase in striatum and cortex and how it is affected by autophagy regulationresponsethank you for pointing out this is very interesting point but we did not reach that in our previous report  inhibition of ask can regulate striatal cell death but cannot affect the amounts of ros or oxidative stress itself in this study we tried to suggest that inhibition of ask regulates mapkinase signaling and also could affect autophagy which could help ameliorating striatal degeneration in this study mitochondrial damage by np led mitochondrial ros overexpression and trigger mitophagy for clearing damaged mitochondria however striatal cells failed to handle damaged organelles whereas cortical cells overly worked in

BRXVK_6_Response_to_Review_input.json,Response to reviewer comments,1326,0, 17,0,2,Response to Reviewer #1: Response to Reviewer #2:,response to reviewer we thank you for carefully reading our article and for giving valuable comment our answers blue text to your comment are given below the comment while the corresponding modifications made to the article are indicated by yellow highlightsthe manuscript presents a seemingly useful method how the thermodynamic nonisotropic parameters important for simulating grain growth can be determined from an experiment based on reading the manuscript i must express considerable doubt that this is practically feasible at best it is possible to obtain grain microstructure states from experiment for several discrete times for simplicity we can assume that we know these states from a computer experiment performed by simulation using the phasefield method then it is necessary to show clearly in the paper how only from these states obtained by the computer experiment the presented method can obtain thermodynamic parameters close to those used in the computer experimentunless the authors provide a much clearer and more convincing presentation of their method publication of the manuscript cannot be consideredwe appreciate reviewers suggestion we think that what you pointed out in your comment are the following issues in actual experiments grain microstructure data can be obtained only for limited discrete times and the time interval for obtaining the microstructure data is much larger than the time increment used in grain growth simulations therefore the present method of parameter estimation which is based on simulations is difficult to apply to experimental data and is not practically feasible explanation on the mechanism and computational procedure of the present data assimilation method is insufficientif so our answers to the above points  and  are as followsanswer to point in data assimilation the time interval for incorporating observation data dtobs does not have to be set equal to the time increment of simulations dt actually in the numerical experiments presented in section  of the manuscript we set dtobs to dt where dt   was nondimensionalized with a scale of  s which means that the synthetic microstructure data were generated and incorporated only for every discrete time of dt       s this interval  s is within a possible observation interval several tens seconds at which grain microstructure states are obtained in actual experiments on grain growth and related phenomena because the present numerical experiment results have demonstrated that as shown in section  our data assimilation method with dtobs   s can perform accurate parameter estimations the method can be considered as being applicable to real experimental data furthermore we found that if we set dtobs twice that used in the present study the accuracy of the parameter estimation is not significantly decreased please see supplementary data attached in the revised manuscript in addition for smallspatiotemporalscale phenomena eg nanocrystalline grain growth atomistic calculations such as molecular dynamics can also be used to obtain observation data which allows for using arbitrary observation interval for such smallscale cases therefore we believe that our proposed method is feasible in the application to actual observation data from experiments andor atomistic calculationsto clarify the above points we have added the following sentences to section  data assimilationhere we want to add a brief note on the practical feasibility of the present method in the twin experiments we set the filtering interval dtobs to  dt where the time increment dt was nondimensionalized by a scale of  s this means that the synthetic microstructure data were generated and assimilated only for every discrete time of dt       s this interval of  s is within a possible range of observation intervals several tens seconds at which grain microstructure states are obtained in actual experiments of grain growth and related phenomena  furthermore we found that when we set dtobs twice that used in the present study the accuracy of the parameter estimation is not significantly decreased though the convergence of the estimation results becomes somewhat slower as an example comparison of the parameter estimation results with dtobs  dt and dtobs  dt for the multigrain system is given in supplementary data for details of the multigrain system twin experiments see section   in addition for smallspatiotemporalscale phenomena eg nanocrystalline grain growth atomistic calculations such as molecular dynamics can also be used to obtain observation data which allows for using arbitrary observation interval for such smallscale cases therefore we believe that our proposed method can be readily applied to actual grain growth observation data obtained from experiments andor atomistic calculationsanswer to point according to the reviewers comment we have added more detailed descriptions to section  ensemble kalman filter which are indicated by the yellow highlights in the revised manuscriptresponse to reviewer we thank you for carefully reading our paper and providing insightful comment our answer blue text to your comment is given below the comment while the corresponding modifications made to the article are indicated by the yellow highlightsmy only question to the authors is if there are factors not accounted for by the model such as pinning by second phase particles or d effects would the parameter estimation method suffer serious consequences in the simulations presented the parameters reached the assumed values within several thousand time steps could this process experience oscillations or even diverge if other unaccounted effects play a rolewe appreciate reviewers comment on this point at present we have not yet tested our data assimilation method for the cases that you suggested and therefore cannot say for certain however we expect that if some physical factor not accounted for by the present mpf model exists in observation data it may not cause serious oscillations or divergence but may lead to a decrease in the estimation accuracy of grain boundary properties for example let us consider the cases where a grain boundary pinned by a secondphase particle is included in the observation data for such a pinned grain boundary the present data assimilation method will underestimate its mobility value this is because the pinning force is not considered in the current mpf model and thus slowdown in the grain boundary movement is reproduced only by calibrating decreasing the boundary mobility valuetherefore if we have to use observation data in which severe effects from unaccounted physical factors d effects particle pinning and driving forces other than grain boundary energy etc are apparently included the mpf model should be extended such that it accounts for those factors the governing equation of the mpf model is independent of dimensions and the pinningdriving forces are easily introduced into the model eg i steinbach msmse    y suwa isij int    t kinoshita  m ohno comput mater sci    furthermore even if the pinningdriving forces are unknown in some case those forces can be treated as estimation targets of data assimilation hence our data assimilation method can be applied for the cases with additional physical factors without any difficulty we believe that the inclusion of the additional factors will not significantly decrease the accuracy and convergence of the parameter estimations which will be confirmed in our future studyto consider the above points we have added the following sentences to section  twin experiments for multigrain systemsfinally a possible extension of the present data assimilation method is discussed in this study we focused on simple grain growth driven only by grain boundary energy on the other hand there are several physical factors that are not accounted for in the current mpf simulations including particle pinning and additional driving forces other than grain boundary energy because the pinningdriving forces are easily introduced into the mpf model  our data assimilation method can be extended to handle more complicated growth phenomena furthermore even if the pinningdriving forces are unknown in some case those forces can be treated as estimation targets of data assimilation we believe that the present method can perform accurate parameter estimations even for the cases with the additional physical factors which will be confirmed in our future work

exchanger with kerosine flow it needs to be revised for the following commentsit will be useful to explain the purpose of kerosine heatingthe purpose of heating kerosene is to cool the combustion wall with kerosene fuel while simultaneously achieving the spray of fuel and the promotion of combustion by evaporation due to the heated kerosene this technique is essential for the practical use of scramjet engines using supersonic combustors operating at high temperatures this has been added to introductionintroduction compare with previous studies the contribution and novel feature of this study should be explainedthe phase change of liquid fuel is an important parameter in studying the scramjet regenerative cooling technology however experimental studies on the phase change of fuel in the insitu state in the scramjet regenerative cooling technology are insufficient the novelty of this study is to analyze the phase change characteristics according to the fuel flow rate by measuring the surface temperature fuel pressure and temperature of the scramjet engine insitu conditionin addition there is a study to measure the surface temperature of scramjet combustor using a phosphor thermometry but the measurement area was  mm x  mm and the measurement uncertainty of the phosphor thermometry for surface temperature measurement of the scramjet engine was not evaluated in this study a calibration system was established to apply the phosphor thermometry to the scramjet engine and the uncertainty budget for the phosphor thermometry for measuring the surface temperature of the scramjet engine was proposed based on this a large area of  mm x  mm inside the scramjet engine made of cmc was visualized using phosphor thermometry for the first time this has been added to introductionthe difference of the temperature measurement case in this study the calibration of the phosphor thermometry was performed using and electric furnace the actual measurement was carried out as shown in fig  the  nm laser passed through the opticalwindow and combusted hydrogen flow was there any influence of the window and flow to the laser characteristics and temperature measurement accuracy if there was no influence why  phosphor thermometry                                                    iccd    ns                     the influence of optical windows and combusted hydrogen flow is negligible in this study the reason is that the quartz optical window used in this study transmits about   of the laser wavelength  nm and signals from phosphor  nm  nm in addition since this study uses the signal intensity ratio rather than the signal intensity to measure the temperature it is not significantly affected by the quartz window and during the  ns exposure time of the iccd used in this study the influence of light from the combustion is negligibly small therefore it can be said that the effect of the optical window and combustion on the accuracy of the phosphor thermometer is negligiblefig  it is recommendable to show the kerosine flow channel and flow directions if there is any influence of channel distribution effect to the cooling performance it would be interesting topic to mentionin figure  the fuel channel of the heat exchanger the direction of fuel flow and the temperature measurement area are added the flow of fuel flows in one direction from left to right and  fuel channels with a width of  mm are located at intervals of  mm the  mm wide fuel flow channel is distributed at a narrow interval of  mm and the distance between the channel and the wall of the heat exchanger is relatively wide as  mm it is considered that the heat exchanger channels of uniform distribution will cause the cooling effect to occur homogeneous therefore the surface temperature distribution measured in this study does not appear to have a significant correlation with the distribution of the fuel channelfig  a front view of heat exchanger b bottom view of heat exchanger c sequential image and average value of cmc heat exchanger surface temperature over time at kerosene flow rate  gs in a scramjet enginefig  if this reviewer understands correctly for the kerosine flow rate of  and  gs it was completely vaporized in the heat exchanger and it was twophase flow liquid  vapor at the exit of the heat exchanger for the flow rate of  and gsif it was the explanation for the figures fig  needs to be revisedespecially for fig  it looks like the kerosine for the flow rate of  and  gs still remained liquid phase without any vaporization even though the actual condition at the heat exchanger exit was saturated liquid vapor state theoretically themeasured state should be on the boiling point line for the liquidvapor phase saturation state mixture if this reviewers comments are correct please revise related explanations and figureswe believe that kerosine for the flow rate of  and  gs still remained liquid phase without any vaporization there are two reasons to support this first in fig  the calculated fuel temperature value assuming that evaporation does not occuronly liquid phase and the measured fuel temperature value coincide with time when the flow rate is  gs this means that when the flow rate is  gs no evaporation occurs in the heat exchanger second in fig  when the flow rate is  gs and  gs the temperature and pressure at the outlet of the heat exchanger are located to the left of the boiling point curve of the fuel which confirms that the fuel is in a liquid state therefore we believe that kerosene fuel is the only liquid phase not the two phase state when the flow rate is  and  gs and the pictures and explanation were make based on thisfig  outlet fuel temperature variation over time observed for different fuel flow rates  and  gs obtained from simulations and experimentsfig  outlet fuel pressure of the heat exchanger for different flow rates     and  gs according to the outlet fuel temperature in the scramjet

appreciatereviewer  the characterization of the chondroitin sulfate cs content of the head cartilage  being unutlilized remnants after food processing of sturgeons has been analyzed and compared with  other bone fishes especially atlantic salmon in order to find a future source for cspgs in food industry or potentially in pharmacy this objective is important due to the increasing shortage of cspgs from shark or other fishes and the increasing number of publications on the biological effects of this and similar materiala i appreciatereviewer  the manuscript focuses on an interesting topic which was tried to find a promising resource for chondroitin sulfate proteoglycansa i appreciatediscuss the originality contribution addition of knowledge to scientific literature or field of the manuscriptreviewer  characterization of cs preparations from such a number of bony fishes is novel and their structural data are unique and useful for the future researchesa i appreciatereviewer  the manuscript adds original and solid data to the scientific literaturea i appreciatereviewer  chondroitin sulfates from various resources have been reported and compared but there are less studies focus on proteoglycans  the investigation on the proteoglycans in this manuscript seems novela i appreciateclearly identify the strengths and weaknesses of the method described in the manuscriptreviewer  the strength of this paper is the structural information of cs preparations from various sources they are useful the weakness is no data for their functions or biological activitiesa experiments are in progress to clarify the biological activity of sturgeon proteoglycansreviewer  the structural characterization of the material is the major strength and the biological functional effects of the material is the major weakness of the manuscripta experiments are in progress to clarify the biological activity of sturgeon proteoglycansreviewer  the manuscript has investigated the structure of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans  however neither sugar chains nor aggrecan has been well elucidateda aggrecan is chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans we performed a comprehensive analysis of cs structure in proteoglycans derived from the head cartilage of  edible bony fishes including siberian sturgeon acipenser baerii russian sturgeon acipenser gueldenstaedtii and atlantic salmon salmo salar it was found that the ss ratio of cs in perciformes was more than  while it was less than  in cs from sturgeon and salmon dot blotting suggested that aggrecan protein was abundant in the head cartilage of all bony fishes tested in this study we further analyzed the composition of proteoglycans in the skulls of russian and siberian sturgeons using nano lcmsms and the aggrecan protein from loc and loc genes registered in the ncbi database were found to be abundant in the skull of sturgeonsmake specific useful comments on the writing of the manuscript eg writing organization figures

solidreviewer  it seems finea i appreciatemake specific comments on the authors interpretation of the results and conclusions drawn from the resultsreviewer  the results and conclusions seem to be appropriately writtena i appreciatereviewer  i think the structural conclusions are well motivated from existing data although many heterogeneities in cs structures may still be hidden this is due to the general complexity of gags making these molecules extremely challenging to analyze in detail but this circumstance is not limited to this particular studythe biological effects of sturgeon cspgs remains to be shown and should only be regarded as speculative until data are available the authors are referring to ongoing studies i would however argue that the authors should not use the combination of a promising source and functional activitiesingrediants in the text until such data are availablea functional ingredients was revised to ingredient of health foods please see p th line

sampling mechanisms are sufficient and well describedreviewer  the statistics seem to be oka i appreciatereviewer  there are no statistical comparison performed in this manuscript as already pointed out in the first round of review this could have been of value for figs  and a to obtain the composition of disaccharide units of cs please see vertical line cs was degraded by chondroitinase abc and resulting unsaturated disaccharides were analyzed by hplc for this reason data of disaccharide unit of cs were expressed as the meansd n of three independent experimentsreviewer  it is recommended to

and made improvements of the manuscript accordinglya i appreciatereviewer  the introduction did introduce the aggrecan the sentences in page  lines  among them three globular domains of aggrecan termed as g g and ghas low similarity among species may be better placed in the introduction it is recommended to add this information about the aggrecan in the introductiona thank you very much for your recommendation to emphasis of the fact that amino acid sequence of the cs domain of aggrecan depends on the animal species i would like to keep this sentencein addition it seems unnecessary to introduce ds in the introduction the manuscript was focused on cs it is recommended to rewrite the first paragraph in the introductiona ds is also called to chondroitin sulfate b csb ds was identified from marine organisms including shark fin for this reason i would like to keep this sentencein the section  and   bony fishes no japanese amberjack no bluefin tuna no sea bass no japanese jack mackerel no chub mackerel no pacific saury no red seabream no atlantic salmon no siberian sturgeon no russian sturgeon were investigated  but in the followed section there are only  bony fishes no russian sturgeon no siberian sturgeon no atlantic salmon chum salmon why these  bony fishes were investigated in the following studies and why chum salmon was in the following studies is it used as a controla commercially available cs has been prepared from the cartilages of porcine chicken shark ray salmon and squid among them it was found that sulfation pattern of cs from russian and siberian sturgeons was similar to that of cs from salmon fig  in addition the size of head cartilage of  bony fishes including russian and siberian sturgeons and atlantic and chum salmons are bigger than that of head cartilage of other fishes except for bluefin tuna please see p th line from the bottom proteomic analysis of nasal cartilage of chum salmon was also performed and it was found that aggrecan was abundant in cartilage in addition biological activity  of proteoglycans from chum salmon nasal cartilage has already been studied using for this reason chum salmon nasal cartilage was used as a controlin section  it is suggested to show the comparison among the amino acid sequences of loc loc chum salmon zebrafish and humana thank you very much for pointing it out supplementary materials figure s was revisedthe proteoglycans in the skull of russian sturgeon and siberian sturgeon were investigated through nano lcmsms the results were compared with the amino acids encoded from gene symbols of loc and loc belonging to sterlet sturgeon acipenser ruthenus in page  lines  the sentence these results suggest that the composition of proteoglycans in the skull of sturgeon is similar to

much appreciate your constructive suggestions very detailed advice and recommended literature to our manuscript we have learned so much from them and the manuscript has considerably benefited from them we have checked and amended the manuscript according to your comments and marked the changes in blue font here as well as in the revised manuscript we have thought seriously about these comments and tried to answer them after much considerationwe would like to thank you for allowing us to resubmit a revised copy of the manuscript and we highly appreciate your time and consideration we look forward to working with you to move this manuscript closer to publication in frontiers in psychologycomment  lines  whereas you do cite some of the contemporary research on bicultural identity you do not address the issue of different culturesdifferent cultural experiences related to one another for instance lafromboise and colleagues  mentioned that cultural elements or identities might be disconnected or fused and similar issues are also at length discussed in the work of benetmartinez whose work you cite it is a bit surprising that you do not discuss any of these issues simply because the very purpose of your empirical work is to document a how cultural experiences are sought out b how the individuals with a different cultural experience identity relate to new experiences in the context of another culture c then how people adapt and d how they integrate these new cultural experiences into their existing identity as an artist in short even when none of the previous research discusses the specific problems and challenges faced by artistsart scholars there should be some acknowledgment that these types of culturalpsychological issues have long been discussed in the literatureresponsea citation is added in this part on page  lines there are also several models that discussed what happens to individuals as they undergoes the process of secondculture involvement as well as described the psychological processes and cultural experiences associated with being bicultural assimilation models assume individuals of one culture relinquish their home cultural identity as they acquire a new identity in a different culture tadmor et al  they will experience a sense of alienation and isolation until they have been accepted within this new culture acculturation models assume individuals are forced to learn the new culture and they will always be identified a member of their home culture even though they have became a competent participant in this new culture lafromboise et al  alternation models assume that individuals should be able to understand two different cultures and change their behaviour to fit a particular social context they could have a sense of belonging in two different cultures without having to choose between them and compromising their sense of cultural identity lafromboise et al  multicultural models assume that individuals can maintain a positive identity as a member of their home culture at the same time they also can develop a positive identity by engaging a larger entity consisted of different cultural groups their public and private identities are disconnected and bicultural stress could lead to personal growth lafromboise et al  fusion models assume that cultures will fuse together until they form a new culture individuals would have experiences similar to one undergoing assimilation once fused the psychological reality would be indistinguishable from members of secondculture under mutual influence lafromboise et al  either way bicultural individuals may enhance greater integrative complexity intellectual flexibility and creativity in the process of negotiating two cultures benetmartnez lee and leu comment  lines  i do not understand how this quote by a participant fits with the expectations and desires of host cultures before going abroad is the speaker referring to a teacher in their home country china or about an experience they had in their host country the quote does create the impression as if the speaker did not know western modernity at all because their chinese teachers stopped talking about any western art following the pop art period the early s when the speaker then discusses his experience at or following graduation he seems to be recounting the response of a chinese professor because all of the artists in the sample were trained in china hence the quote seems to describe the origins of the speakers sz desire to study contemporary art in western countries however it does not seem to mention any expectations and desires of host cultures before going abroad please clarifyresponsethe speaker means that the black and white works he drew for graduation which is nobody including his teacherprofessor in china could understand he knew a little about western modernity by selfstudy he expected to go abroad where someone could understand and guide his works so he desired to study contemporary art in western countriesmaybe its better to change it to origins of desire to study abroad on page  line comment  general comment on the discussion section it is noticeably that you do not currently comment on the contemporary literature in cultural psychology for instance in line  you mention that this work relates to biculturalism yet you do not comment on the connection of your findings to this literature what you discuss in terms of achieving a higher plane of integrating sounds a bit what lafromboise coleman and gerton  described as fusion when discussing biculturalism lafromboise t coleman h l  gerton j  psychological impact of biculturalism evidence and theory psychological bulletin    also the kinds of processes you discuss of cultural reflection and integration remind me of this type of research that i only encountered recently tadmor c t galinsky a d  maddux w w  getting the most out of living abroad biculturalism and integrative complexity as key drivers of creative and professional success journal of personality and social psychology   as of recently there is quite a bit more research on biculturalism and creativity  in short whereas i do believe that the focus on artistsart scholars is special i need you to make sure to integrate your workyour findings a bit more with the existing work on crosscultural experiences surely you need to focus on what is special about this work and this sample however you should point out the many points of connection that exist with this existing literatureresponsewe have revised the text to change thisprevious literature described as assimilation acculturation alternation multicultural and fusion when discussing biculturalism according to lafromboise and colleagues  assimilation and acculturation focus on acquisition of the host culture emphasize a linear and unidirectional relationship between home culture and host culture assimilation will form identity of host culture but acculturation will always be identified as a member of their home culture alternation provides a bidirectional and orthogonal relationship between the individuals home culture and host culture it promotes us to consider the influence that individuals from both cultures have on each other multicultural provides a pluralistic approach to considering the relationship between two or more cultures which are tied together within a single social structure it addresses the possibility of cultures maintaining distinguishing identities individuals could involve in one culture while maintaining identity in another fusion emphasizes producing new culture and assigns equal status to the two or more cultures however reconstruction we are talking about in this research shows artists and art scholars from a linear and unidirectional acquisition to a bidirectional and orthogonal balance then to reconstruct cultural formation and produce cultural identity living abroad benefits individuals to enhance creativity and integrative complexity but how one taking a bicultural approach while abroad can be critical to producing lasting cognitive changes and psychological benefits

KIAY_11_letter_Editage_input.json,Response to reviewer comments,856,0, 17,0,0,,dear drthank you for giving us the opportunity to revise our manuscript tough hydrogels with rapid selfreinforcement aazi am writing to let you know that we have received the edited manuscript blind review report and revision checklist we feel grateful to you and the reviewers for all the valuable suggestions based on which we are now revising our manuscript you can see current version of revised figures in the attached pdf file our plan of the revision is as followsyou and reviewer  suggested that more detailed information should be added for a fair comparison between tetrapeg gel and slidering sr gels b of your main issues in the revised fig a we compare the stressextension ratio curves of sr gel and tetrapeg gel with the same peg concentration  wt by applying a classical rubber network theory to the youngs modulus of the sr gel the average strand length between the slidering crosslinks is calculated to be about  gmol which is almost the same as that of the tetrapeg gel even though the two gels have the same initial network structure the sr gels show higher stress and strain at break because the straininduced crystallization sic occurs only in the sr gelthe sliding behavior of crosslinks in sr gels is influenced by the length of the peg main chain as shown in fig sb of the previous version of sm decreasing the peg chain length suppresses sic due to narrower slidable range of crosslinks according to your suggestion we will measure a stressextension ratio curve of a sr gel with shorter peg chain molecular weight k and add a discussion on the effect of the peg chain length on mechanical properties of sr gels in our revised manuscriptyou and reviewer  mentioned that the normalization of the stress by polymer concentration fig s of the previous manuscript is misleading a of your main issues we agree that the simple normalization does not work since the contribution of polymer concentration to stress is too complex we will remove the figure in our revised sminstead of that we plan to add a new figure showing stressextension ratio curves normalized by youngs modulus in our revised sm this is our answer to your question about how we can compare stressextension ratio curves of the different sr gels in fig s of the attached pdf file we plot stress normalized by youngs modulus against extension ratio for the sr gels with different polymer concentrations based on the normalized curves we can discuss clearly the difference of large deformation behaviors between the gels for the sr gel with the lower concentration sr wt the slope of the stressextension ratio curve becomes gentle at extension ratios over  at which sic occurs sic stabilizes deformed polymer networks which results in stress relaxation the normalized stress of the sr gel with the higher polymer concentration sr wt deviates from that of sr wt around at the extension ratio of  where sr wt starts to form sic the sic formation causes stress relaxation and suppresses the strainhardening due to finite extensibility of polymer chains at large strainsyou asked about the effect of the cd coverage on mechanical properties of sr gels  of your main issues when the cd coverage is less than  the crosslinking efficiency of sr gels drops down because the number of cds is not enough for crosslinking for example polyrotaxane of  cd coverage has only  cds on a peg chain this is why we chose  coverage for this workin addition you suggested us to describe type of crosslinks between cds in the main text cds are crosslinked by bifunctional crosslinker divinyl sulfone and the covalently connected figureofeight crosslinks slide on polymer chains figb we will add the explanations in our revised manuscriptif we want to disrupt cdcd bindings as you suggested one possible idea is to reduce the crosslinker concentration however gelation does not occur at crosslinker concentrations lower than  for this workfollowing your comment we summarize all the data of figc and fige of the previous manuscript in a new table table s of the attached file we plan to add table s in our revised version of smaccording to your comment we will add an opening sentence about the weak mechanical strength of conventional gels at the beginning of the main textfollowing your advice we will add more information of the sample compositions for the sr gels in the revised main text and add a table showing concentrations of all the components cd peg and solvent in our revised smyou suggested that the strain rate dependence of stressextension ratio curves for the different polymer concentrations should be added we will perform the tensile measurements at various strain rates for sr gel with a lower polymer concentration and include the results in our revised smyou asked us to add discussions about the polymer concentration effect on the fatigue and fracture properties shown in fig  we will perform fatigue and fracture tests on sr gel with a lower polymer concentration and add the results in the revised version of smwe have been synthesizing polyrotaxanes with different peg chain lengthscd coverages to prepare sr gels for the additional experiments of   and  considering the rest of the synthesis process and mechanicalscattering measurements for   and  we would be able to submit the revised manuscript by early aprilplease feel free to contact us if further discussion is needed about this revision planagain thank you for giving us this opportunitybest

effect of crosslinking bottlebrush polymers on a surface and its application in biofouling and cells adhesion their work comprises the synthesis of a series of bottlebrush polymers with different brush length their deposition on the surface and crosslinking of the deposited bottlebrush polymers via a radical coupling reaction they demonstrate that the biofouling is minimal when bottlebrushes with longer brush lengths are employedthis paper challenged me because i do not agree with the premise of their main hypothesis ie the representation of their bottlebrush polymers their figure  is central to my challenge where i find the representation of bottlebrush polymers to be misleading to my understanding their representation of the long brushes sticking out straight is inaccurate the brushes tend to take collapsed random coil conformations at the specified grafting density range in order to avoid misleading we revised sdpbtype bottlebrush in figure graft chains are more collapsedwhile i agree that further away you go to the axe of the bottlebrush the more space the brushes can explore but that additional space does not lead to the brushes pointing out straight the way it is represented this representation is appropriate for flat surfaces but not for bottlebrush polymers i believe sing and rogers published a softmatter paper in  where they investigated the size of the bottlebrush as a function of the brush length my disagreement with this representation of their brush conformations in the bottlebrushes leads me to find their effective graft density value not relevant we appreciate the reviewer for pointing out that our representation of graft chain conformation in the bottlebrushes in figure  is inappropriate we understand the graft chains will collapsed at some graft density in this work we focused only on cpb therefore the effective graft density represented by eq explains an ideal cpb structure in a good solvent namely the graft chains are stretched to their contour length  nm x dpngraft therefore eq is not relevant for sdpb type bottlebrushes we added this explanation in the main text psing and rogers softmatter  wrote that the deviation in the scaling exponents for rgsc fig b is attributed to the relatively short length of side chains and the side chain is indeed slightly stretched due to the steric interactions with neighboring chainszhang and schmidt et al reported the radius of gyration rgsc as a function of the side chain molar mass macromolecules  they used bottlebrushes with relatively short graft chains dp     as shown in table  rgsc is close to the length of their contour lengths nm x dp for relatively shorter chains from the ratio of rgsc to the contour length the graft chains stretched to   of their full length as shown belowtable  is take from macromolecules    without permissioncontour lengthnm                                                                         rgccontour length                                                                      rathgeber et al jcp  also reported that rgsc   nm for dp   the graft chains stretched to  of their full lengththese values are close to ours for dp the swollen thickness was   of the full length and for dp   it was  therefore we think that the bottlebrushes can have cpblike structure by optimizing the graft chain length graft density as we hypothesizedsince the authors observed a clear difference in biofouling and cell adhesion with different brush lengths i proceeded further to review the technical aspects of the paper i found it interesting the way they determined the grafting density by adding a small molecule initiator in their graftfrom polymerization i dont recall anyone doing that with bottlebrush polymer synthesis before the obvious hypothesis that they consider is that a free initiator vs a pbiem have the same reactivity their use of the gpc to validate this hypothesis is clever however i do not understand why the initiation of thesmall molecule would be so low as the initiation efficiency of ebib a free initiator is   the initiating efficiency of pbiem itself is  in fact when we used styrene small monomer the initiating efficiency of pbiem was almost  ref  on the other hand molecular volume of pegma monomer mw  is much bigger than that of styrene mw   since the chain contour length per monomer unit is same as  nm for both monomers polymers the initiating efficiency ie the grafting density of ppegma decreased than that of ps as illustrated belowalong with that the steric of the pbiem should further decrease this efficiency pbiem was the longest in this work and mnpmma   and pdi   the pbiem is much shorter than the pbiem mnpmma   and pdi   which was used for ps bottlebrush in our previous work ref  therefore within the examined pbiem in this work dp    and  the steric of pbiem does not affect the initiating efficiencylast i do not remember seeing how they removed this nonbottlebrush polymer impurityfrom their desired product when we synthesized bottlebrushes we did not add ebib a free initiator in the polymerization system therefore we do not need to remove free polymers from the system this was already written in the main text p  and  to be paid more attention we added gpc traces of polymerizations with and without free initiators in sii also found their crosslinking studies to be interesting the authors present their results with molar ratio with the argument that each brush regardless of its dp will yield one crosslinking point while this is true it is ignoring the difference in crosslinking density that they obtained the high dp bottlebrush have much lower crosslinking density because their mws are much higher i strongly believe that the difference between all the bottlebrush they observed is related to that and not to their grafting density concept one piece of validation of that is the degree of swelling as shown in figure b which clearly indicates that their system does not follow the theory since the crosslinking is occurred at chains ends the crosslinking density the crosslinking points per bottlebrush is the same for cpb and sdpb bottlebrushes independent mw dpthe theoretical value in figure b is for the ideal cpbtype bottlebrushes it assumes that the graft chains are stretched to their full length and the bottlebrush has a cylindrical structuretherefore the sdpbtype bottlebrushes do not follow the theoryreviewer the submitted manuscript reports on the effectiveness of crosslinked bottlebrush polymer coatings to prevent biofouling the authors synthesize two series of bottlebrush polymers comprised of polyethylene glycol methacrylate grafts of different molecular weights while varying the backbone degrees of polymerization the polymers are polymerized using a graftfrom procedure in which the bottlebrush backbone and the pegma grafts are synthesized using raft and atrp respectively the authors show that bottlebrush polymers in the concentrated polymer brush cpb regime are more effective in preventing biofouling as compared to bottlebrush polymers in the semidilute polymer brush sdpb regimebiofouling is a major issue in biomedical applications which is due to protein adsorption and cell adhesion the authors nicely show that crosslinked bottlebrush polymer coatings are effective in preventing biofouling when polymers are densely grafted other than a few technical comments below the manuscript should be considered for publication after minor revisionscommentsgpc traces are mentioned continually throughout the manuscript but no gpc traces are shown in the main text or the si the authors should report all gpc traces for the polymers reported in the manuscript we added the gpc traces in si as suggestedif possible the authors should use additional characterization methods to confirm film crosslinking beyond simply stating that there is minimal change in film thickness after washing we added the film thickness before and after washing in si as suggestedhave the authors conducted the crosslinking procedure in solution to establish that the molecular weight of the sample increases crosslinking reaction was conducted in dry state in our previous work ref  in order to clarify crosslinking reaction was completed in dry state the crosslinked film ps bottlebrush was hydrolyzed and we analyzed it by gpc the gpc trace clearly showed a bimodal distribution that could be obtained by radical coupling of two graft chainsscheme  shows that the crosslinking is between bottlebrush chains but there is a high likelihood that chains will crosslink within the same bottlebrush polymer as the reviewer pointed out the intramolecular crosslinking may occur we added this in the main text pwhat is preventing the polymer films from detaching from the substrate during swelling in order to covalently attach bottlebrushes silicon wafers immobilized bpe bromine at one end were used this was already explained in p how uniform are the films what role does surface roughness play in biofouling since the bottlebrush films were prepared by a spincoating method the surfaces were very smooth as an evidence we showed afm images below the coatings were measured in dry state the roughness is a few nm we think that the roughness of the bottlebrush films does not affect the nonbiofouling property the sizeexclusion effect one of the cpb effects plays an important role for nonbiofoulingcpb type bottlebrush pbime was used the dry thickness   nm ra   nm rq   nm and rz   nmsdpb type bottlebrush pbime was used the dry thickness   nm ra   nm rq   nm and rz   nmreviewer commentsin their manuscript the authors report the use of crosslinked bottlebrush polymer films as antifouling coatings the bottlebrush polymers were prepared by a conventional raftthenatrp graftingfrom approach and were subsequently crosslinked via sidechain radical coupling to form films the authors explored the influence of backbone and sidechain length on film thickness swelling behavior and cellular adhesion critically the bbp films significantly inhibited cell adhesion relative to the untreated culture plate this approach to antifouling coatings reduces the complexity of surface grafting as the authors noted however it is unclear how the cost and effectiveness of the films produced in this work compare to traditional densely grafted polymer surfaces the effectiveness namely the nonbiofouling property of bottlebrush coatings is almost same as that of densely grafted polymer brushes it is difficult to directly graft polymers from medical devices which have complex shapes such as tubes and syringes in addition typical silrps is unsuitable for the massive surface modifications in comparison it is much easier to coat bottlebrush polymers on the deviceswhilst bbps make excellent platforms for academic studies their commercial implementation has thus far been limited due to the need for several polymerization steps in their preparation bbp films also differ drastically in their stability and mechanical properties compared with traditional entangled polymer films or grafted polymers for example sidechain scission is common for bbps in response to mechanical stress we thank the reviewer for pointing out the mechanical property of bottlebrushes the stability of bottlebrushes depends on the chemical structure therefore we are investigating the sidechain scission and the longterm stability of the bottlebrushes in near future we will publish the resultsbased on these factors i suggest that revision is warranted prior to publication of this article in biomacromolecules specific commentssuggestions are listed belowthe manuscript suffers from the lack of a comparative control to the existing stateoftheart how does cell attachment swelling contact angle etc of the bbp films compare to surfacegrafted polymer films previously we reported that concentrated ppegma brushes directly grafted on silicon wafers shows excellent bioinert property ref  and  the cell attachment contact angle etc on bbp films were almost same as our previous data on the typical cpbs we added this explanation in the main text p  and  how stable are the bbp films to repeated swellingdeswelling does their performance deteriorate over time due to side chain scission the bottlebrush samples are stable we repeatedly measured the swelling degree and contact angles on the same surfaces and the results little changed if the side chains were disconnected from the graft chains the values would changerelatedly is cell adhesion suppressed over multiple swellingdeswelling cycles cell adhesion can be suppressed on the bottlebrush coatings even after multiple swellingdeswelling cycles the durability and longterm stability of the bottlebrush coatings including swellingdeswelling cycles is a subject of ongoing research in near future we will publish the results however as an evidence we show some unpublished data below figure  the bottlebrush coatings were dipped in brine for two months every one month the coatings were taken out from the brine and their dry thicknesses were measured by an ellipsometer subsequently l cells were seeded on the surfaces for  months the bottlebrush coatings experienced multiple swellingdeswelling cycles but the coatings could suppress l adhesion even after  monthsfigure  fluorescence images of l cells adherent on bottlebrushes as well as cell culture plates nuclei were stained by dapi blue cell culture time  h how do film mechanical properties such as toughness scratch resistance etc compare to grafted polymer films previously we reported that surface frictional property of the cpbtype bottlebrush surface was almost same as that of the cpb directly grafted on a silicon wafer ref  in addition the bottlebrush coatings were stable even after dipping in brine for  months and they suppressed cell adhesions those results indicate that the bottlebrush coatings have enough mechanical property for some nonbiofouling applications raw sec and nmr data after each polymerization step should be provided in the si we added h nmr data and gpc charts in si as suggestedthe kinetic data shown in table s is incomplete have the authors omitted data or were the polymerizations only sampled a few times each how can a complete kinetic picture be obtained from this information table s is to show the initiating efficiency of pbiem in order to avoid misunderstanding we revised the caption of table s

[Revised Figure S1] Reviewer: 2 [After revision] [After revision,response letternov  reviewer recommendation major revisions needed as notedcommentsin this manuscriptthe choi et al innovatively by mitigating the insufficiencies of conventional photolithography and stamping processes a desirably patterned agnwbased flexible electrode was successfully developed a photocrosslinked pvcn layer was applied as the underlayer for better agnw distribution and reduced aggregation the performance of flexible pscs based onxpvcnagnwsxpht electrode was comparable to that of the device on rigid ito electrodes this is a very interesting work and its high potential for the future flexible optoelectronic device applications however the following points about this work need to be improved the trace of nanowires can still be seen in figure  c please explain whether it is the reason for shooting or that there are nanowires left after cleaning in addition the right picture of figure a adopts a um scale bar so whether a larger magnification can be adopted which helps the reader to judge the residue of nanowires in unexposed regionresponse thank you for your comment the few agnws shown in figure c are thought to be not completely removed even after a short period of sonication because the agnws are unexpectedly and strongly attached to the polymer underlayer during processes such as thermal annealing however the number of remaining agnws are very small they are separated from each other and do not cause conduction in the unexposed area of course if additional sonication is performed all agnws can be removed but it was not performed because it could damage the electrode pattern we also changed the magnification image in figure c to allow the reader to judge the nanowire residues in the unexposed areas and we also mentioned the content of residual nanowires in the textafter revision page the patterned electrodes demonstrate a distinct boundary between the uvexposed and unexposed areas the exposed region exhibited conducting properties with rs   figure b the few agnws observed in the unexposed area did not affect the conductivity in figure  a and b scale bar are missed in figure f the addition of xpht leads to the increase of the transmittance of the film the optical gain comes from the interface effect or the high refractive index of xphtthe author needs to explain this abnormal phenomenonresponse thank you for your comment we have added the scale bars in figure a and b as appropriate the relatively low transmittance of the film prior to xpht application is mainly due to the haziness caused by the multilayered nanowires which can be explained by the interfacial effect however when xpht is applied to the agnws the network of agnws is wellorganized and the nw overlapped structure is significantly loosened resulting in a slight increase in transmittance this phenomenon is also well described in the literature dealing with the deposition of pedotpss on agnws j mater chem c    we added the referencesreference  in the manuscriptafter revision page as shown in figure s the overall transmittance in the visible range tends to be increased by reduced light scattering due to the uniform distribution of agnws in figure  a each different bending radius shall be clearly marked at which position the bending radius is measured in figure  b the author gives the change of resistance before and after bending hoping to further reduce the bending radius until crack or warpage occurs and analyze when delamination and cracking occur in the nanowires before and after bending such as the sem image of cross section and the performance comparison between the new method and the traditional nanowire device is added to figure  cresponse thank you for your comment we marked the exact location where we measured the bend radius also the accurately calculated bending radius was corrected in the text and figure after revision page the mechanical performance of flexible pscs on the agnwbased electrodes was examined at different bending radii as shown in figure  in the flexible psc the degradation in voc was negligible   and jsc and ff values retained  and  of the initial values respectively even after  bending cycles at a bending radius of  mm figure c then the pce dropped to approximately  of the initial value after  consecutive bending cycles even at a radius of  mm these values are also consistent with the bending tests of the agnw electrodes figure s the sheet resistance of the agnwbased electrode essentially remained unchanged until the lowest bending radius of  mm figure b we have already performed additional bending experiments  bending cycles but no peeling and cracking were observed on the surface and only the relative resistance increased slightly it was expected that the adhesion stability between the substrate and agnw was also improved due to the lower and upper layers composed of a polymer with excellent mechanical endurance traditional nwbased pv devicesinverted opv configuration generally have a device structure of substrateagnwsznoactive layermooag appl phys lett    however the traditional nwbased electrode without the xpht layer was unable to be patterned so the performance could not be compared with the devices in this study therefore we conducted a performance comparison study with a device using an ito electrode having a pinwheel pattern similar to the device structure used in this text figure s a patterned under light condition there are irregular bright spots please explain the reasonrevised figure sfigure s a patterned electrode images fabricated on pet substrate b pattern images of agnws colored with red dye nnbisdimethylaminopropylaminopropylperylenetetracarboxylic diimidepdinnresponse thanks for your comments it was difficult to obtain a clear image of the pattern image of the agnw electrode formed on the actual pet substrate due to its high transmittance figure sb therefore in order to show a clear pattern a pattern was fabricated on a silicon wafer and the image was measured the original figure is an image of a patterned sample on a silicon wafer where the brightness of the image varies depending on the angle of incidence of light and because the optimal electrode manufacturing conditions are different depending on the characteristics of the substrate surface the pattern may not be uniform on the silicon wafer we remove figure s which may confuse the reader and add a new pattern image of agnws colored with red dye pdinn in revised figure s in this case the same pet substrate was used and a clear image of the boundary of each pattern can be obtained so the new image is put in figure s instead of the original images the reviewer doubt the ultrasonic treatment during the experiment affect the deposited silver nanowires please explain in detail figure  a b shows a decrease in the density of silver nanowires is this change due to ultrasound please add ultrasound agnw experiments using different timesresponse thank you for your comment the changes in the electrode pattern image with time of sonication are summarized in figure s the ultrasonic treatment time was optimized to  minutes because the pattern of the exposed area started to be damaged after sonication for more than  minutes for your reference figure r shows the sem image of the damaged electrode after sonication for  minutesfigure s optical images of patterned agnws film with increasing sonication timefigure r sem images of damaged electrodes after sonication during  min in figure a and b the decrease in the density of agnw is not affected by the sonication but rather because the agnws are heavily covered with agnws by the xpht overcoating layer sonication for a long time does not reduce the overall density of the agnw but partially damages the agnws and the xpht layer together as can be seen in figure rreviewer recommendation publish after minor revisions notedcommentsthis paper focuses on the use of an underlayer to improve the distribution of a patterned silver nanowire array as a transparent electrode the paper is well written and of a very high scientific standard and should be published  my only concern is whether the significance of the results is appropriate for this journal the authors are more enthusiastic about the positive results of using this underlayer than i was upon reading it i commend the authors in including uncertainty information with the data which is a measure of the high standard of work in the paper  many publications do not do this there is a small decrease in sheet resistance with the xpvcn layer not statistically significant based on uncertainty but probably more importantly the variation in the measurements is a lot smaller implying that this method may lead to a more reliable and spatially consistent electroderesponse thank you for your comment in this study we introduced an xpvcn underlayer so that we could obtain a uniform agnw layer if the xpvcn layer is not used as shown in figure a and e the portion where agnws are agglomerated the portion with very low resistance in figure c and the portion with few agnws the resistance is very high in figure c part could be observed these statistical results were confirmed by several experiments and used in this study as more reliable data the roughness is also reduced but it is still very high for opvs using    nm thick layers of interface buffers and bhj and the authors identify this as a cause for the device performanceresponse thank you for your comment we fabricated the pscs device in this study with petagnwsxphtzno nmpmy nmmoo nmag nm structures therefore since a  nm zno layer is also applied on the xpht layer it is expected that it will have a negligible effect on the device performancefigure r afm images of the films a petxpvcnagnws b petxpvcnagnwsxpht c petxpvcnagnwsxphtzno d petxpvcnagnwsxphtznoactive layer as a result of placing a zno layer and an active layer on the fabricated patterned electrode the afm data were obtained figure r although the shape of the electrode is visible it is judged that it is not large enough to affect device performance a stylistic issue is that often the manuscript refers to data in supplementary info and then gives a simple summary in the text  for ease of reading it would be better if this was reversed ie present a value and then refer to the supp info which has more data well presented it makes it difficult to read especially if the initial comment and the value are on separate pages as i found myself looking for the supp info before seeing the valueresponse thank you for your comment we added the sentence in manuscriptafter revision page  to obtain clear patterns the development time by sonication in distilled water were also optimized to  min figure s and s as shown in figure s some particles in uvunexposed regions still remain under sonication for less than  sec as shown in red circles page  the photocrosslinking time of xpvcn was optimized to  min by examining the uvvis absorption spectra the variation of absorption spectrum with the uv exposure time was shown in figure sreviewer recommendation major revisions needed as notedcommentsthis article provides an interesting approach for the fabrication of flexible electrodes by photolithography the results of the psc under bending are interesting and show excellent performances the article is well written the figures are fine and the topic is of interest i recommend to publish this article after taking into account the suggested modifications it should be clearly stated whether the transmittance is total or specular regarding the proposed technology the haze factor should be measured and discussed in the article it is stated that the proposed materials are suitable for optoelectronic devices this depends strongly on the haze value typically expected below   for pv application this is not an issue large haze are preferred but for most applications this could be a serious issueresponse thanks for your comment we have corrected the text to clarify transmittance at  nmafter revision page  the electrical properties were presented in terms of the sheet resistance and the transmittance t was measured at  nm t nm using a pet substrate as a blank page  the electrode without an xpvcn underlayer was also prepared under the same conditions for comparison which exhibited sheet resistance of   at t nm of  as follow your comment we searched the literature to measures the haze factor however an additional integrating sphere accessory to absorption spectrometer was needed to measure the haze factorj mater chem a    and acs appl mater interfaces   unfortunately we do not have the equipment of integrating sphere accessory to measure haziness therefore the transmittance of the thin film measured using an absorption spectrometer was reflected in the results of this study we would appreciate it if you could understand our situation the sem images in fig show large amounts of agnws hardly compatible with high transmittance and  nm diameter nanowires could the authors comment on that point response thanks for your comment a real agnw electrode with high transmittance does not show the sem image shown in figure f the image shown in figure f was measured by intentionally applying highdensity agnws to clearly show the degree of uniformity figure r shows the agnwbased electrode image that shows the high transmittance

XLRJV_3_20210311_rebuttal_rev6_input.json,Response to reviewer comments,974,0, 21,0,0,,we thank the reviewers for your thoughtful suggestions and insights the responses to the comments have been prepared as below in below r     mean reviewer      respectively details of the pixelintensity method rrrproblem settingthe goal is to realize given illuminance lmm at each surface point by multiple projectors then multiple users can simultaneously observe same appearance without depending on the viewing angle under the assumption that the object is lambertian toward this goal we need to decide the luminous intensity cd for each pixel of each projector we control the intensity by estimating the weight which represents how the goal illuminance is divided to each projectorwe used irradiance in the paper but it should have been replaced with illuminance we intend to explain all the quantity based on amount of photometryjustificationas r pointed the justification for the method is not good we agree with it and would revise to separate and explain two topics including quantization error and planar approximationeffects of exponential termsour method can make weight vary smoothly by using the exponential term k if k becomes too larger only the projector with larger contribution has weight this is close to the nave method introduced in sec in this case the artifacts around the boundary of the projection area are visible if k becomes too smaller all the projectors have same weights in this case the artifacts around discontinuous geometry are visible this effect can be found in fig  curved line on the floor is caused by miscalibration and disappears when k becomes larger fig  also shows that this technique can be comparable to the prior work using global optimizationimplementationwe do not need to render multiple images redundantly viewed from each projector on each node when determining the weight of a surface point for a projector we require only the distance the incident direction and the visibility from each projector to the surface point it can be acquired efficiently by ray tracing without rendering the images directx raytracing can contribute to accelerate this calculation drastically limitation and their possible solutions rrrrthe demonstration is limited in the rigid white lambertian objects having known shapes however our method is not limited in this conditionspatiallyvariant albedoalbedo for each surface point can be introduced in eq as r pointed this albedo is acquired once and used for the calculation while the highbrightness projector is required when the object has a low albedo our method can be applied to the object with spatiallyvariant albedo we will revise to general our modelnonlambertian surfaceour method is currently difficult to be applied to nonlambertian surface because we leverage the lambertian reflection to break this limitation we need to control the projection by evaluating the observed reflection at all angles while keeping the projection areas varying smoothly we believe that such extended method still can be implemented in pixelparallel scheme to handle this situation the number of the required projectors will be increasedinterreflectionif we know how the interreflection occurs we can compensate it interreflection caused in an object can be calculated in advance siegl therefore our system can remove such artifact even when it moves however interreflection between dynamicallymoving objects need to be calculated in realtime speedingup of such calculation is challengeable we may be able to achieve it by leveraging the efficient raytracing methodnonrigid bodyour method can be applied to nonrigid body because of the following reasons first our pixelintensity control method is not dependent on rigid or nonrigid body second we consider the nonrigid deformation acquisition can be achieved at high speed in near future for example markerbased approach is achieved at fps narita in markerless tracking recent work shows around fps performance gao there are also fps deformation acquisition with some limitation in texture mapping miyashita third challenge is to avoid the network bottleneck because size of the deformation data is larger than the rigiddata however our transferred data for the rigid body is currently only around  byte we already have confirmed that the kbyte transfer took only  us moreover while our results are based on gbps network faster network with gbps is now availableprojector focusto avoid the defocus projection we plan to add the focusrelated term to the weight for the intensity control based on the blurred amount estimated from the distance between the projector and the surface point artifacts in dynamic scene rrin video we can see artifacts in dynamic scene this is caused by large latency we still can reduce the latency in the tracking and image generation part we also plan to introduce the prediction to avoid such artifacts we believe that the sensing frame rate is high enough so that the prediction can work effectively even with a simple algorithm details about the camera rour system handles object camera and projector coordinate systems the transformation between camera and projector coordinate system is obtained in advance we also know d shape of the object the camera system obtains the transformation between object and camera coordinate system that are d position and orientation of the object in real time which can be changed according to the object motion using these data we can arrange the object in the projector coordinate system and render the projected images latency rlatency from image capture to tracking calculation is ms latency from broadcasting to projection with four rendering computers which generate a single projector image respectively is ms without using vsync as shown in fig and fig total latency is around ms when two images are generated by one rendering computer total latency is around msfig shows that the image generation time is larger than the projection frame time ms fps however we have confirmed that new gpu rtx  could reduce the generation time additional validations rrrwe will add indepth and other validations such as quantitative analysis color projection etc
NANOR_15_REVIEWуБо_reply__цабцнгуБлуБЯуВЩуБЩуВВуБоуГ╝3_input.json,Response to reviewer comments,1667,0, 31,0,3,Reviewer #1: Reviewer #2: Associate Editor:,reviewer comment  there is still a question as to whether the decision on the treatment strategy was made with the safety of patients in mind which should be the most important fundamental consideration the graph showing  pnd with a brain protection time of more than  minutes is shocking and these cases must be in a very serious condition because of total cerebral injury it is necessary to plan the surgery with the awareness that the time limit is even shorter than that of  degrees celsius or less compared to the risk of global cerebral ischemia i dont think the reduction of  units of rcc and  units of ffp is worth it in recent years there have been warnings from the perspective of spinal cord protection against the tendency to easily raise the temperature even for ascp young cardiovascular surgeons in particular need to understand that they may be taking on a great deal of risk i do not think that this paper in which the temperature is raised higher in rcp can be easily accepted from an educational point of viewanswer  thank you for your valuable question we completely agree with that the safety of patients is most important only one case using rcpmhca for  min secondary circulatory arrest was performed for resuture of distal anastomosis first rcp time was for  mins and second rcp time was for  mins in retrospective view we might have had lower temperature or used acp in this case we added details of this  mins case page  line as you pointed out we should plan the surgery with the awareness that the time limit is short we think that rcp time exceed  mins are not preferable for brain protection because there is no clear evidence supported in our  patients  mins  patients mins  patient using rcpmhca with a circulatory arrest time of  to  mins there were no pnd but there is a little case and still unclear about the safety of prolonged arrest time if anastomotic trouble occurs and the circulation arrest time is expected to exceed more than  minutes a transition is necessary as soon as possible we are always ready for transition during rcpmhca it is described in answer secondary from the perspective of spinal cord protection calculated safe intervals was understood wildly from fundamental and clinical research minutes for   minutes for  and  minutes for  at rectum temperature in our cohort our rectum temperature was almost  and the longest rcp time was less than  minutes except for the above one case and there was no paraplegia in all rcpmhca patients n rcpmhca seems to be safe for spinal codehowever we agree with the risk of the tendency to easily raise the temperature weappreciate your constructive feedbackcomment  authors should describe clearly the completion rate of the cases started with rcp  cases in  cases how to do during the transition and the results of the transition casescases the high completion rate means that the preoperative decision on the indication for surgery was correct but the most important thing is to deal with the remaining three cases i think that the legitimacy of this technique can be recognized only if the transition cases also have satisfactory surgical results if the results of the transition cases are poor it is important to sufficiently examine whether or not there was a problem with the indication for this procedure and it is necessary to present specific cases suitable for this procedureanswer  thank you for the precise advice all three conversion cases are acute aortic dissection and because of unexpected location of entry and total arch replacement was required there were no hospital deaths and no pnd in these casesin case of right axillary artery perfusion we put the cannula into the left cca and lsca and performed acp in other cases we put the cannula into the all arch vessels directly and performed acp in our institute perfusionists prepare for both rcp and acp in all aortic surgeries required circulatory arrest that is why it takes less than  minutes to convert to acpcomment  regarding the method of ascp authors described axillary cannulation was performed by sewing an  mm graft to the right axillary artery through a subclavicular incision is this method also used when transitioning from rcp to ascp this method is timeconsuming and perhaps a different method might be used for the transition and please describe the method of transition to ascp in detailanswer  thank you for this great suggestion as you pointed out we only put cannula into arch vessels in transition casescomment  the cannulation could cause cerebral infarction in ascp and it is necessary to pay attention to the details of the ascp method evaluation of the atheroma in the aorta to the arch vessels and careful decision of cannulation site accordingly are necessary to establish a safe ascp in cases in whom it is difficult to establish a safe ascp if har is possible it is truly a good indication for this technique although the lack of manipulation in the brachiocephalic artery and left common carotid artery may be a very appealing point in this technique that could be weakness in transition to total arch replacement even after matching there was a difference in ca time between  and  minutes which may be related to the simplicity of the rcp technique the surgeons hasty suturing due to the time limit and the surgeons competence anyway the short ca time is a good point in this techniqueanswer  thank you very much for your preferable commentscomment  in consideration of the educational aspect i think the authors should describe how and when to make a safe transition to ascp i think it needs to be improved for acceptanceanswer thank you for your kind suggestion in case of acute aortic dissection preparation for transition is necessary contrary to preoperative expectations when the primary entry located in aortic arch transition to sacp is necessary for total arch replacement or partial arch replacement moreover if anastomotic trouble occurs and the circulation arrest time is expected to exceed more than  minutes a transition may be necessary as soon as possiblefor quick transition cooperation with the perfusionist is important and both circuits for brain protection must always be preparedchange as we described in change  we added the details about transition cases page line reviewer comment  in the conclusion section they spoke out that  rcp  mhca is a safe strategy for protecting the brain during har however care should be taken to limit the circulatory arrest time to  minutesthe question is where is the exact evidence to support this conclusionthe findings barely support the no inferiority of the rcp in avoiding postop tnd to the acp but not pnd after  minutes of circulatory arrestit should be rational to conclude that rcp is as safe a strategy as acp for protecting the brain during moderately hypothermic har however the care should be taken to limit the circulatory arrest up to  minutesanswer  thank you for your precise opinion we think that we should be cautious about prolonged circulation arrest time rcp time exceed  mins may be not preferable for brain protection because there is no clear evidence about the limits of the rcpmhca in our  patients  mins  patients mins  patient using rcpmhca with a circulatory arrest time of  to  mins there were no pnd but there is a little case and still unclear about the safety of prolonged arrest time so we proposed  minutes for safety of rcpmhcachange  we revised as belowcomment  the quality of the written english is hardly acceptable for publication it should be strongly recommended that the manuscript undergoes grammatical correction by native english speakersanswer  i am so sorry for this fundamental issues native english speaker have already corrected our manuscript however we submitted to the native check again and many correction was performed thank you very much for this kind adviceassociate editorcomment  first at least following descriptions are grammatically incorrectpage  line  currently aortic surgeries performed underpage  lines  after systemic heparinisation cpb was performed withit is desirable that whole manuscript undergoes native english speakers check otherwise please acknowledge the person who have checked the manuscriptanswer  thank you very much for this kind advice native english speaker have already corrected our manuscript however we submitted to the native check again and many correction was performedcomment  these results suggest that the safety of rcp with shorter circulatory arrest is suggestive about tnd however the description in later years shortterm rcp was used prior to acp and these  cases were excluded given the difficulty of their interpretation page  lines  led us to speculate the authors have already realized the limit of rcp thus if the selection bias including the natures of surgeries about the patient who underwent shorter rcp and longer acp is clarified the stronger message about the safety of rcp would be providedanswer  thank you for your great suggestion definitely there is selection bias about rcp or acp rcp tends to be used for simple har case also in cases in whom it is difficult to establish a safe ascp if har is possible it is truly a good indication for this technique we could not describe this in discussion for word limit so we added this to the limitation
UQFIJ_14_ReviewerуВ│уГбуГ│уГИуААfinal_input.json,Response to reviewer comments,2102,0, 33,0,10,<Our response> <Our comment> <Our comment> <Our response> (5) Reviewer comment <Our response> (6) Reviewer comment <Our response> <Our comment> <Our comment>,reviewer i summarize my comments on the manuscript with some minor points the appropriate revision on these parts is required before publishedas the reviewer s comments can be divided into  parts we numbered them from  to   our responses or comments to these eight points are shown belowreviewerthe results in this work suggest that the water molecules in the waterpoor phase of liquidliquid phase separation observed as upfield peak by nmr are important for blood compatibility however for example polyethylene glycol is known to be highly blood compatible although it is water soluble and so never cause the phase separation in water in this case maybe only the downfield peak appears how can the authors explain such situationhopefully the additional experimental samples are required to support their conclusionour responseas pointed out the reviewer peg is famous for its good blood compatibility as peg is a water soluble polymer in the application of peg to the blood compatible material the fixation on the material surface is needed to insolubilize it thus the state of the peg will be very different from the solution state mentioned by the reviewer on the other hand it is reported that peg can have the upfield water depending water content this report also support our conclusion that the upfied water is an important factor to express the good blood compatibility our response to peg is included in the response to the reviewers comment  please see our comment and response to  that is the substitution of the section  with new one we propose that the liquidliquid phase separation is not important but the upfield water is important we have already found that the polymer has only the upfield water without phase separation and shows good blood compatibility that will be reported somewherereviewer commentthe intensity of upfield peak in pthfa increases with increasing temperature does it mean that the blood compatibility of pthfa is temperature dependent and pthfa shows higher blood compatibility at higher temperatureour commentwe also think that the compatibility may improve at the higher temperature as predicted by the reviewer however the real temperature range in the medical usage is from room temperature to body temperature in the present study the range corresponds to  to  c or  to  c that is the practical temperature range is narrow the difference between the quantity of the upfield water at  c and  c is small  and  respectively so the effect of the difference on the blood compatibility will be small in addition it is easily predicted that the higher temperature than body temperature   c deteriorates the blood compatibility because of the direct temperature stimulation on the blood components as well as the lower temperature stimulation thus the negative effect of the temperature stimulation on the blood compatibility results in the difficulty in finding the positive effect of the increase in the upfield water quantity reviewer commentit seems to be opposite to the process of hydrationour commentthe polymer sample has an equilibrium water content before the nmr measurement thus both the liquid phases polymer rich and poor phases were in an equilibrium state each other meaning that the water contents in both phases are in the equilibrium state and vary depending on the temperature in the case of pthfa the water content in the polymer rich phase increase and the water content in the polymer poor phase decrease depending on the increase in the temperature reviewer commentthe authors concluded that the hydrogen bonding style quantity of upfield peak is effective on blood compatibility but i think the mobilities of downfield water and upfield water showed large difference among the samples as shown in t values in table  so the author could discuss the blood compatibility of the polymers from the aspect of water mobility the hydrogen bonding style and the mobility of water may not be separatableour responsewe substituted the section  relation between water structure and blood compatibility with the following sentences in the revised manuscript this revised section included the our response to the reviewers comment  on peg in addition in the section  conclusion section the last sentence is corrected as followsbefore revise a higher quantity and higher mobility of upfield water are preferableafter revise a higher quantity of upfield water are preferableas described earlier pthfa and phema have markedly different water structures the unique property of pthfa is the existence of upfield water similar to that in pmea except for the quantity of the water and the peak shape on the other hand phema has only downfield water like the case of pba having poor blood compatibility  thus these results imply a marked difference between the polymers with good blood compatibility and the polymers with poor one when other hydrated materials are viewed in terms of the investigation of the water structure by nmr peg wellknown as a bloodcompatible material  can be attended it is reported that the water peak in peg shift to the upfield from  to  ppm with a decrease in the water content  on the other hand other nmr analyses show that peg aqueous solution exhibited one water resonance peak at ca  ppm downfield   in the usage as the biomaterial peg must be fixed or crosslinked at the material surface to insolubilize it where peg is not in a solution state thus the result of the former report  will reflect the real state of pegwater on the biomaterials these results support our proposal that the important factor explaining the excellent blood compatibility is the water structure losing the hydrogen bonding that is observed as upfield water by nmr on the other hand pmea pthfa and phema have one thing in common the point is that they have the water molecules with slow mobility downfield water of phema and upfield water of pthfa and pmea thus the effect of the mobility on the blood compatibility is discussed belowthe reason for the low mobility of downfield water in phema will be as follows water molecules interact with hydroxy groups and carbonyl groups of phema together with the interaction with other water molecules without losing hydrogen bonding network where the mobility of functional groups in phema is markedly low due to the low mobility of the polymer itself resulting in the formation of slow mobile water whereas the upfield water in pthfa and pmea are isolated water molecules by the polymer matrix polymer rich phase having the slow mobility resulting in generating the low mobile water though the water molecules lose the hydrogen bonding to some extent thus as the causes bringing about the slow mobility are different it is not reasonable to compare just only the th value mobility of water molecules when the difference of blood compatibility among the polymers phema pthfa and pmea is considered on the other hand the comparison of the motilities of upfield water molecules in pmea and pthfa may be worthwhile when the difference of the blood compatibility between them is considered however we do not have enough data to discuss how much the difference affects the blood compatibility the results that the upfield water of pmea is more mobile than that of pthfa imply that the higher mobility of upfield water molecules is preferable for the good blood compatibility however to clarify it further investigations are needed jora mz cardoso mvc sabadini e

can mention about the relationship between chemical structures and blood compatibility water structure based on their conclusion for example why is the quantity of upfield water larger for pmea than for pthfa from their chemical structuresour responsewe add the following sentence to the  in the results and discussion p lines the difference of the quantity of upfield water between in pthfa and pmea will be based on the followings the fact that the water contact angle of pthfa is higher than that of pmea  and  respectively indicates that pthfa is more hydrophobic than pmeathis is caused by the difference of the numbers of hydrophobic methylene groups in the side chain pthfa has five methylenes and pmea has two methylenes figure  the difference in the hydrophilicity brings about the low ewc of pthfa   compared with that of pmea  resulting in the lower quantity of upfield water of pthfa than pmea sato c aoki m tanaka m bloodcompatible polymethoxyethyl acrylate for the adhesion and

responsewe substituted the discussion part on figs  and  with following sentences in the revised manuscript section from page line  to page  line moreover the asymmetry of the peak of phema figure  was further discussed using figure  where each spectrum at the downfield obtained from the th measurements under predetermined variable parameters  points was overlaid and the spectra at representative temperatures    and  c are shown the magnetization was inverted by an initial pulse and then recovered to thermal equilibrium duringvariabledelay timethrough th relaxation generally such overlaid spectra show the relaxation process from the negative phase to the positive phase after the  plus radiationif the object molecules are in a homogeneous averaged state the negative peak returns to the positive one keeping symmetry on the other hand if the object molecules are in the plural statesnot averaged the negative peak returns with asymmetry that is the difference of the recovery rate among the molecules in each state observed when the recovery of the downward peaks to upward is attended for example the spectra at  c in figure  one can notice that the recovery of a part of the peak higher than  ppm component  area lag behind a part lower than ppm component  areathe overlaid spectra for other temperatures also indicate a similar tendency thus figure  suggests that the broad downfield peak derived from more than two types of water with different relaxation rate this also suggests that the water have different hydrogen bonding styles for these two areas components  and  the th value are obtained and the values are listed in the bottom of each overlaid spectra in addition to the th value for the whole asymmetry peak listed under the temperature as the th value of the component  is higher than that of component  the water molecules appearing at the upper magnetic field component  water are more restricted this figure also suggests that the peak intensity of component  decreases with an increase in the temperature and the components tend to merge this could be explained by the averaging of the water structures due to the increase in the exchange rate between component  and component the overlaid spectra of pthfa obtained from the th measurements are shown in figure  this figure shows that both upfield and downfield peaks returned symmetrically from negative to positive phases indicating that the peaks are derived from the homogeneously averaged component reviewer commentthe molecular weight of pthfa  and phema  used in this work are very different why did the authors use these molecular weights and does it affect the resultsour commentthe reviewer is afraid of the low molecular weight of pthfa compared with that of phemathere is no reason for using pthfa with low molecular weight we performed the normal radicalpolymerization of thfa using aibn giving the polymers having such molecular weights  we have now investigated the effect of molecular weight of pmea on the water structure observed by nmr using the molecular weight range from  to  and have not yet observed a difference among them in the chemical shift and the quantity of upfield water thus the molecular weight will not affect the present results and conclusion or the effect is negligibly small reviewer commentwhat is the kink in t value for upfield water in figour commentthe reason is not yet clear such kink in th value around  c is also observed in pmea we are investigating the mobility of pmea molecules in terms of cnmr relaxation time t in the temperature range from  to  c in the investigation we find that the methylene group in the side chain of pmea ochchome change the state from solid to liquid around  c while the carbonyl carbon and methoxy carbon are in the solid and liquid states respectively through the investigated temperature range thus such transition in the side chain affects the th properties of water resulting in the kink in the th graph because the oxygen atom parts of the side chain take part in the hydration of water molecules these findings are now planning to submit elsewhere on the basis of these findings we think that the kink in the th graph of pthfa also is caused by the similar transition of the side chain in pthfa

study aimed to elucidate the association between a decrease in lung mibg uptake and antidepressant intake and myocardial mibg uptake in patients who were clinically diagnosed with lewy body disease lbd and patients who were diagnosed as not having lbdmethods we retrospectively reviewed the heart and lung uptakes of  consecutive mibg scans antidepressant status and clinical diagnosis of lbd the images were visually classified into two groups decreased lung uptake and preserved lung uptake a semiquantitative analysis was performed using the hearttomediastinum ratio hm lungtomediastinum ratio lm and myocardial washout rate wrresults all  patients with decreased lung uptake were treated with antidepressants while none of the  patients with preserved lung uptake were treated with antidepressants of the  patients with decreased lung uptake  were clinically diagnosed with lbd and  were clinically diagnosed with nonlbd there was not significant difference in early hm delayed hm and myocardial wr between the  nonlbd patients with decreased lung uptake and  nonlbd patients with preserved lung uptake    vs       vs    and    vs    respectively moreover in lbd patients there were no significant differences in those values between six patients with decreased lung uptake and  patients with preserved lung uptake    vs       vs       vs    respectivelyconclusions antidepressants probably blocked mibg uptake in the lungs and decreased lung uptake was not significantly associated with heart uptake a remarkable decrease in lung uptake can serve as a signal to check a patients medication statuskeywordslewy body disease mibg lung antidepressant serotonin transporterintroductionscintigraphy using imetaiodobenzylguanidine mibg a norepinephrine ne analog is helpful for discriminating lewy body disease lbd from other neurodegenerative disorders mibg is taken up by the sympathetic nerve terminals through catecholamine transporters but is not metabolized therefore it accumulates in the sympathetic nerve terminals myocardial mibg accumulation can reflect sympathetic nervous integrity and mibg scintigraphy is currently among the indicative biomarkers of dementia with lewy body diagnostic criteriamyocardial mibg accumulation is decreased in patients with lbd because lewy body pathology involves the peripheral autonomic nervous system as well as the central nervous system  although the lung also shows physiological mibg uptake it is not related to lbd we previously reported two cases in which mibg lung uptake remarkably decreased with the use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ssriserotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor snri and was preserved during the medicationnaive or withdrawal state these findings suggest that mibg uptake in the lungs may be affected by antidepressants through serotonin transporters serts and norepinephrine transporters nets in addition elucidating whether the decrease in mibg lung uptake is associated with a decrease in cardiac accumulation is important in the diagnosis of lbdin this study we retrospectively investigated mibg scans to investigate the lung mibg uptake in relation to antidepressant intake and its effect on the hearttomediastinum ratio hm which is commonly used to assess cardiac mibg accumulationmaterial and methodswe identified  consecutive mibg scans performed as part of the clinical evaluations for the diagnosis of lbd at our hospital between april  and march  a clinical diagnosis of lbd was established based on the movement disorder society clinical diagnostic criteria for pd  and the dlb consortium consensus criteria the exclusion criteria were as follows patients treated for cardiac disease pulmonary disease or severe diabetes mellitus because they also affect mibg uptake in the heart and lungs patients on reserpine or labetalol which are known to interact with mibg heart uptake and images with no motion artifacts consequently two scans among those conducted one with a motion artifact and the other with severe emphysema were excluded therefore  scans were included in this study of these scans were performed twice for five patients and three times for one patient therefore while the number of patients and the number of scans differed we considered each scan as related to an individual patient this study was performed in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and was approved by the institutional review board of the institutes hospital informed consent was obtained from all patientsimaging protocola dose of  mbq  mci of imibg myomibgi injection fujifilm toyama chemical co ltd chuoku tokyo was injected intravenously with the patient in the supine position anterior chest planar images were obtained at  min early image and  h

performed for  min within an energy window of   visual evaluationtwo nuclear medicine experts visually evaluated the mibg images and classified them into two groups decreased lung uptake and preserved lung uptake when the lung mibg uptake was almost the same as the background it was judged to be decreasedsemiquantitative evaluationwe calculated the hm and lungtomediastinum ratio lm as semiquantitative values of heart and lung mibg uptake respectively regions of interest rois were placed on the heart and the upper mediastinum area using the software smart mibg fujifilm toyama chemical co ltd in which the hm values were standardized between the two different gamma cameras the conversion coefficient was  for the former gamma camera with the legp collimator and  for the current gamma camera with the megp collimator as obtained by dedicated phantom experiments  we also placed  cm square rois manually on the right middle lung field to avoid superimposition with heart accumulation and the mediastinum fig  because the digital data available for the current computational system had not been stored manual roi placement could not be performed for the data obtained prior to october  lm was calculated only for the  scans obtained after the camera was changedwe calculated the myocardial washout rate wr as followswhere he and hd are the mean counts of the heart rois in the early and delayed images for each patient respectively similarly me and md are the mean counts of the mediastinum rois in the early and delayed images respectively for the calculations these counts were corrected for decay from the time of injection when the lung and heart uptake were very low rois were carefully placed on the lung and heart to visually compare the chest xp of each subject the mediastinum roi for hm calculation was automatically generated by smart mibg but was adjusted manually when the position was located outside of the mediastinumstatistical analysislm was compared between the decreased lung uptake and preserved lung uptake groups next in the patients who were not diagnosed with lbd nonlbd hm and myocardial wr were compared between the decreased and preserved lung uptake groups the same comparison was performed in the patients with lbd these numerical comparisons were performed using the ttest or mannwhitney u test when the distribution was nonparametric statistical significance was set at a twotailed p   all statistical analyses were performed using the statistical package for the social sciences spss software version  ibm corporation armonk ny usaresultsall  mibg images were visually classified into two groups based on mibg lung uptake  with preserved lung uptake and  with decreased lung uptake on all of the images two nuclear medicine experts judgments were agreed upon lm were available for  patients including  preserved lung uptake scans and  decreased lung uptake scans early lm and delayed lm were significantly lower in the decreased lung uptake scans than in the preserved lung uptake scans early lm and delayed lm   and    vs    and    respectively a finding that is consistent with the visual classification a boxandwhisker plot of ln is shown in figure while none of the  patients with preserved lung uptake were treated with any antidepressants all  patients showed a decreased lung uptake with antidepressant use of whom  were taking an snri duloxetine  mgday four were taking an ssri sertraline  mgday escitalopram  mgday paroxetine  mgday fluvoxamine  mgday each and  were taking a tricyclic antidepressant tca clomipramine  mgday all of these patients were treated with these drugs for more than one month thus we considered that they underwent mibg scan in the steadystate plasma concentrations of each antidepressant one patient who underwent mibg scintigraphy  days after discontinuing an snri duloxetine  mgday was classified into the nonmedication category because the day period was considered sufficient for drug withdrawal from the body based on the drugs hour halflifethe distribution of patients according to clinical diagnoses antidepressant medication status early hm delayed hm and myocardial wr are summarized in table  representative images of preserved lung uptake patients with nonlbd and those with lbd as well as decreased lung uptake in patients with nonlbd and those with lbd are shown in figure  the plots of early and delayed hm and myocardial wr in individual patients are shown in figure  there were no significant differences in early hm delayed hm and myocardial wr between patients with preserved and decreased lung uptake among the nonlbd patients p    and  respectively and no significant differences in these values between patients with preserved versus decreased lung uptake among the lbd patients p    and  respectivelydiscussionin this study  mibg scans were retrospectively investigated to assess mibg lung and heart uptake in relation to lbd and antidepressant use our findings showed that the use of antidepressants including ssris snris and tcas was associated with decreased mibg lung uptake in patients with nonlbd while the lung uptake was decreased the heart uptake was preserved it was assumed that antidepressant intake may not interfere with the diagnostic value of mibg scintigraphy at the doses used in our patientsthe physiological uptake of mibg is observed in the lungs and heart however unlike myocardial mibg uptake lung mibg uptake has not been related to the pathological status of lbd in this study lung uptake was decreased in all of the patients who were treated with ssris snris and tcas suggesting that mibg uptake in the lung is involved with catecholamine uptake sites including serts blom et al demonstrated that mibg accumulation in human platelets which express serts was reduced by ssri suggesting that mibg has an affinity for serts therefore ssris may interfere with mibg lung uptake at the sert sites in a human study on the use of ccyanoimipramine an imipramine derivative with potent sert inhibitor activity positron emission tomography images showed the highest uptake in the lung suggesting that sert expression is abundant in the human lungserotonin is a vasoconstrictor that acts on the peripheral vascular muscles the ability of the lung to remove serotonin from the pulmonary circulation underlines the importance of the lung in preventing vasoactive substances from accessing the systemic circulation the process of this removal was revealed by experiments using ex vivo rat lungs with specific drugs such as cocaine imipramine and chlorpromazine to inhibit pulmonary uptake of radiolabeled serotonin  where the uptake site was localized mainly on the endothelium as evidenced by electromicroscopy with radiolabeled serotonin  a previous study estimated the extraction rate of serotonin from the pulmonary circulation to the left atrium of heart in patients undergoing pulmonary cardiovascular bypass as  which was higher than that of ne  in a rodent study mibg pulmonary extraction was reduced following endothelial injury these studies suggest the existence of serts in pulmonary endothelial cells that remove serotonin from the pulmonary circulationwhen considering the reason why the lung uptake was remarkably decreased while the heart uptake was preserved in patients taking antidepressants in this study we paid attention to the dose of antidepressants which were relatively low catecholamine uptake systems are classified into two types   one is a sodiumdependent system which is characterized as saturable with high affinity and low capacity and the other is a sodiumindependent system which is characterized as unsaturable and energyindependent tobes et al investigated the relationship between the percent inhibition of these uptake systems by tricyclic antidepressants and the dose of tricyclic antidepressants showing that the percent inhibition of the sodiumdependent system reached almost  at a low concentration of tricyclic antidepressants while the current inhibition of the sodiumindependent system was below  at the same dose of tricyclic antidepressanttherefore we believe that the differences in mibg uptake in the lung and heart related to antidepressant intake may be explained by the predominance of these two catecholamine uptake systems our results suggest that mibg uptake in the lung is predominantly processed by a sodiumdependent system with saturable and lowcapacity characteristicsour results suggest that mibg uptake in the lung is predominantly processed by a sodiumdependent system with saturable and lowcapacity characteristicswe found four patterns of mibg uptake in this study normal decreased heart uptake but preserved lung uptake decreased lung uptake but preserved heart uptake and both uptakes decreased this classification can be helpful in diagnosing lbd in patients while considering their medication status because all patients with decreased lung uptake in this study were taking antidepressants a possible diagram is shown in figure  for example a decreased lung uptake pattern may indicate that the patient is taking an snri ssri or tca and we should consider the possibility of a patient suffering from druginduced parkinsonism the medication doses of patients exhibiting both decreased patterns must also be assessed because relatively high snri doses may also affect the accumulated uptake in the heart antidepressants have recently been used for the treatment of lower back pain and depression in this study one patient was treated with an antidepressant for back pain this suggests that when checking the medication status of antidepressants we should pay attention to the possibility of antidepressants prescribed by orthopedics for back pain not depression we believe that our findings will be helpful for diagnosing lbd in patients treated with antidepressantsthe limitations of our study were that only a small number of patients were taking antidepressants and that the doses of these agents were relatively low although our results suggested that antidepressant therapy did not affect heart mibg uptake a generalized conclusion can only be reached after further research is conducted on patients treated with higher doses of antidepressants furthermore to confirm the effect of antidepressant intake on mibg scintigraphy it is necessary to compare mibg scans with and without antidepressant use in the same patient this study included two cases of such patients as reported previously briefly one patient maintained cardiac uptake on the first mibg scintigraphy but three years later her symptoms proceeded and required further examination since antidepressant treatment for her symptoms before the second mibg scintigraphy was inevitable the second mibg scan showed decreased lung uptake while preserving heart uptake the other patient showed decreased heart uptake on the first mibg scintigraphy while taking antidepressants at that time the effect of the antidepressant was not denied therefore after discontinuing the antidepressant for  days mibg scintigraphy was repeated and showed decreased heart uptake but preserved lung uptake of course we should have conducted mibg scintigraphy after the discontinuation of antidepressants in more patients but such discontinuation exacerbated the patients symptoms and performing two mibg examinations would increase the radiation exposure therefore we did not conduct such interventions in this studyin conclusion our results suggest that mibg uptake can be blocked by antidepressants in the lungs but not significantly in the heart making a diagnosis using mibg scintigraphy for lbd as an indicative biomarker is possible in patients who are taking antidepressants but the effect of relatively high doses of antidepressants remains to be investigated mibg lung uptake can act as a signal to check the patients medication statusacknowledgmentsthe authors thank norio okazak for the support of the professional nuclear medicine technology the authors have no conflicts of interest directly

adsorption capacity was developed for the recovery of gold from an acidic solution a mixture of polyethyleneimine and carboxymethyl cellulose cmc in calcium chloride was added to a solution of sodium alginate to encapsulate the mixture in the calcium alginate matrix formed by ionotropic gelation between divalent calcium ions and alginate the capsules displayed high efficiency with maximum adsorption capacities of  and  mgg for au iii and au i respectively the uptake of au iii increased but the sorption of au i decreased with an increase in ph the ftir xrd and xps studies revealed that the gold adsorption mechanism includes ionic interactions and reduction in which amine hydroxyl and carboxyl groups are involved the capsules demonstrated higher efficiency than the other sorbents making them applicable in an acidic solution for the recovery of goldkeywords alginate carboxymethylcellulose polyethyleneimine composite capsule gold  adsorptionintroductionprecious metals pms are mainly used in electronics owing to their high electrical conductivity and anticorrosive nature   owing to the rapid replacement of electronic devices a large quantity of electronic waste ewaste is discharged into the environment   currently ewaste generation is  million metric tons annually which will grow every year   a significant amount of gold is present in ewaste   in  the recycling of ewaste was approximately   of the  million tons approximately  billion euros of gold is lost in the form of ewaste   nearly  g of gold per ton of scrap can be extracted from ewaste while the ore of gold contains  g of gold per ton  therefore urban mining from ewaste has a lower cost than virgin mining limited natural reserves in addition a very low concentration of gold is found in oceans  million tons freshwater  gl and wastewater  gl annually about  million euros of gold is lost into the sewage of switzerland and the uk therefore gold recovery from ewaste and wastewater is crucial for saving the economy and the environmentat present several technologies such as adsorption solvent extraction membrane separation chemical precipitation and ion exchange have been applied for the recovery of gold  among them the adsorption method has been widely applied because of its sustainability simplicity ecofriendliness low operating cost and high efficiency   in addition adsorbents can be reused several times because of the reversible nature of the adsorption process  several adsorbents used in gold adsorption methods include bioadsorbents synthetic polymers porous carbon and metalbased adsorbents  however existing sorbents have fewer surface functional groups low sorption capacities and are unstable in acidic solutions to overcome these problems it is crucial to develop multifunctional high sorption capacity and acidstable adsorbents for the recovery of goldbiopolymers such as alginate chitosan starch cellulose pectin carboxymethyl cellulose and protein have gained more attention as precursors for the development of adsorbents with multifunctional natural abundance biocompatibility biodegradability and nontoxicity  however raw biopolymers have a low metal adsorption capacity compared to their derivatives  several physical and chemical modifications have been studied to enhance the binding sites via the addition of functional groups and porosity the adsorption capacity of raw biopolymers can be enhanced by increasing the number of binding sites via functionalization and gel formation excess amine and thiol functional groupcontaining molecules have been applied for surface coating crosslinking and composite formation to enhance adsorbent performance owing to their high chelation power toward metals   physical modification of biopolymers includes the transformation of solgel composites into different stable shapes such as fibers beads capsules and membranes which increases porosity and functional group exposure resulting in a high sorption capacity according to the pearson acidbase theory  the n of amines and s of thiols act as hard bases due to the presence of a lone pair of electrons with a very high affinity toward precious metals such as soft acids   based on the hsab principle the adsorption capacity of the biopolymer can be increased by incorporating a large number of chelators such as pei amino acids and polyacrylic acid several efforts have been made to introduce chelating groups into biopolymers such as aliquatimpregnated alginate capsules  crosslinked cellulose gel by sulfuric acid  and naminoguanidine functionalized cellulose powder  the abovementioned adsorbents might solve the selectivity problem but they lack the significant adsorption capacity required for the recovery of gold peimodified bacterial biosorbent fibers  and gapeialginate fibers have been reported to enhance the sorption capacity toward au iiirecently alginate ag has attracted more attention as a hydrophilic polysaccharide that retains all the properties of biopolymers   it is found in the cell walls of brown algae that form viscous gum upon hydration it is the most important anionic biopolymer with hydroxyl carboxyl and ether functional groups in dmannuronate and lguluronate monomers which are beneficial for composite formation and chemical transformation because of these characteristics alginate derivatives have been broadly applied for metal ion recovery and removal  however it does not contain a cationic amino group as an anion exchanger one way to functionalize alginate is to make a composite of alginate blende with amino molecules to incorporate anion exchangers alginate has been mostly fabricated with suitable nitrogenrich molecules through different techniques such as crosslinking surface coating and impregnation encapsulation   for example aliquat impregnated alginate capsule was an effective sorbent for the selective recovery of gold  mgg   recently a gapeialginate fiber was developed for the high adsorption of gold  mgg  many attempts have been made to prepare alginatebased sorbents however very little attention has been given to the development of acidstable alginatebased adsorbents with very high adsorption capacitiesconsidering the above factors we prepared a polyethyleneimineimpregnated alginate composite capsule using an encapsulation method as a highcapacity sorbent for the recovery of gold carboxymethylcellulose was used as an anionic polymer to disperse and stabilize pei as a cationic polymer inside the calcium alginate shell as an interlocking matrix support pei was selected as a chelating agent for penetrating gold ions because of the binding sites provided with three types of nitrogen such as primary secondary and tertiary amines in the molecule which might be utilized as binding sites primary secondary and tertiary amines of pei as a cationic site can interact with anionic carboxylate and the hydroxyl group of biopolymers such as alginate through electrostatic attraction this facile strategy formed an acidstable novel peicmcalginate composite capsule with a high adsorption capacity for anionic gold the effects of ph sorption kinetics and sorption isotherms were studied to determine the adsorption performance of the capsule the morphology of the capsule was studied by microscopy the mechanism of gold adsorption and reduction was

were separately dissolved in  ml of   calcium chloride solution with magnetic stirring for  h then they were mixed just before the formation of the capsule and stirred with a magnetic stirrer to obtain a homogeneous mixture the viscous mixture of cmc and pei in cacl was added to  ml of   sodium alginate solution through a syringe capsules were formed when the ca ions of the drops came into contact with alginate the capsules were then cured in  ml of   cacl solution for  h washed with distilled water several times and stored in dw at room temperature for further use wet capsules were used as sorbents during the experiment characterization of the pristine and gold loaded capsulesthe prepared capsules were characterized before and after the adsorption of gold light microscopy was used to study the physical appearance of capsules kept in a petri dish containing water the functional groups of the capsules before and after adsorption were identified using fourier transform

probability of blockage of the active sitein the dry capsules a dry weight experiment was carried out to determine the water content of peiiac  g wet weight of capsules was kept in a freeze drier to

solutions of  mgl were used for the isotherm experiments the kinetics experiments were performed at various time ranges the adsorption capacity of the capsules was calculated using the following equationwhere  and  are the initial and equilibrium concentrations mgl v is the volume l and m is the dry mass of the adsorbent g results and discussion characterization and possible adsorption mechanismvisual observation of the capsules using a microscope is shown in fig the average diameter of the nearly spherical capsule was nearly  mm furthermore the capsule contained a white mixture of pei and cmc surrounded by calcium alginate shellsto understand the adsorption mechanism impregnation of pei inside the capsule and surface functional groups the capsules before and after adsorption of au were characterized by ftir spectroscopy as shown in figa it is important to identify the functional groups that are mainly responsible for adsorption the functional group and fingerprint region of the spectra show characteristic peaks of the functional groups present in individual pei cmc and alg with a slight shift due to interaction during fabrication the change in the peak value after the adsorption of gold indicates an interaction between the adsorbate and adsorbent through the active site the oh and nh bond stretching vibrations of the capsules at  cm changed to  cm after adsorption of ionic gold  the change in the peak value indicates the interaction between the adsorbate and adsorbent through ionic chelating interactions the broad peak indicates the presence of a large number of hydroxyl and primary amino groups in the composite which reduces after adsorption due to their participation in ion exchange and reduction  the co of carboxylate salt in alginate cmc and nh of pei showed an absorption peak at  cm which increased to  and  cm after the sorption of gold  such an increase in the absorption peak value implies i ionic and ii chelating interactions between the adsorbate and adsorbent  the peak at  due to carboxylic acid oh and alcoholic oh bending of the capsule shifted to  after the sorption of gold it emphasizes the ionic interaction between the ohnh functional group of the capsule and the anionic form of gold the stretching vibration of the primary alcohol co coc of polysaccharide and aliphatic cn present in the capsule occurs at  cm and decreases to  cm after sorption of the adsorbate indicating their participation in adsorption and reduction the ch bending of the capsule at  cm is mainly due to the aliphatic ch group of alg cmc and pei which changes to  cm after sorption indicating a change in the electronic environment furthermore the peak at  cm belongs to aliphatic ch stretching and bending vibrations which reduces to  cm after adsorption indicating adsorption of the adsorbate onto the adsorbent  the shift in the ftir peak after adsorption of gold indicates the adsorption of gold with the capsule through the nhoho and cooh functional groups which was not sufficient to confirm the reduction of gold inside the capsule therefore xrd was performed to determine the formation of metallic gold after sorptionmultipurpose xray diffraction xrd was conducted to determine the crystallinity of the capsules and the mechanism of gold adsorption as shown in figb the xrd patterns of the capsule before and after adsorption of gold were different indicating the formation of metallic gold after adsorption and reduction the formation of metallic gold indicates that the possible mechanism is adsorption followed by reduction the xrd pattern of the capsules after adsorption of gold displayed sharp peaks of au at     and  corresponding to braggs reflections of     and  respectively  the results indicate the formation of crystalline metallic gold nanoparticles with a facecentered cubic lattice inside the capsule indicating that ionic au iii was adsorbed in peiiac followed by reduction in addition the intense peak at the  plane supports the formation of reduced gold thus xrd justified the hypothesis that redoxactive peiac can reduce ionic to metallic goldxps was carried out to reveal the adsorption and reduction mechanisms of gold with the capsules the xps spectra of the capsules before and after the adsorption of gold are shown in fig in the ns spectra of the capsule before sorption of gold the peaks at  ev  ev and  ev are attributed to rnh rnh and rn respectively  after sorption the peaks of ns spectra appeared at  ev  ev  ev and  ev related to rnh rnh rnh and no respectively  this indicates that the positively charged amines formed after protonation in a strongly acidic solution of gold were the main driving force for the adsorption of anionic aucl through electrostatic attraction the appearance of the peak due to no indicated the oxidation of the amino group during the reduction of gold in addition fig c of the au f spectra confirmed metallic and ionic gold inside the capsule the peak at ev and  ev were attributed to au whereas the peaks at  ev and  ev were due to au previous studies have also supported the adsorption and reduction of gold inside peialginate composites from the ftir xrd and xps data the possible adsorption and reduction mechanism of gold with the capsule can be described by the following equationsionic interaction followed by reductionfiglight microscopic image of peiiacfig a ftir and b pxrd patterns of peiac before and after au iii sorptionfig xps of the capsule a before sorption b after sorption and c after sorption of gold effect of phthe surface functional groups of the adsorbents and chemical speciation of the adsorbate are affected by the ph of the solution therefore it is crucial to study the effect of ph on the adsorption of ionic species competing with h and oh ions in an aqueous solution the adsorption trend of au iii and au i onto peiiac at all ph ranges is shown in fig in the case of au iii its sorption increased from  to  ph due to adsorption and precipitation according to gold speciation aucl exists at ph and au oh at ph   the precipitation of au iii starts at ph the high adsorption at ph is not due to adsorption but is due to the precipitation of gold in the form of au oh the capsules become positively charged due to protonation in an acidic solution resulting in electrostatic attractions between aucl and the capsules and anion exchange between aucl and cl therefore the optimum ph for au iii recovery was  which is supported by the literature data   the recovery of au i increased with a decrease in the ph of the capsule at ph au i precipitation is possible in the form of au  therefore it appears to have a very high adsorption value at ph which is due to the precipitation of gold at ph adsorption is low because the capsules become negatively charged resulting in repulsion with anionic species the high stability and elastic nature of the capsule is due to crosslinking with  and intermolecular hydrogen bonding between cooh groups at low ph  the adsorption mechanism of peiiac and aucl can be expressed by equation fig effect of ph for adsorption of au iii and au i into the capsule c   mgl ph   t   h madsvsol

respectivelyaccording to the regression coefficient r and constant parameters shown in table  the experimental data were best fitted for the pseudosecondorder kinetic model for both oxidation states

conclusionsa capsule with a high adsorption capacity was prepared using a simple method for gold recovery the mechanism analysis showed the ionic attraction of aucl with cationic amines and reduction of au to au with primary amines the ph edge experiment revealed an increase in au iii sorption but a decrease in au i sorption with increasing ph the maximum au iii adsorption capacity of the capsule

norio shibataadedication optionalajun zhou zhengyu zhao prof dr n shibatadepartment of nanopharmaceutical sciencesnagoya institute of technologygokiso showaku nagoya  japanemail nozshibanitechacjpabstract cn crosscoupling reactions have always been a fundamental task in organic chemistry however direct use of the nh group of secondary amines to generate ncentered radicals coupled with organic fluorides to construct cn bonds via cf bond activation is still rare herein the silylboronatemediated selective defluoronative amination of organic fluorides with secondary amines was achieved via a transitionmetalfree platform the fine cooperation of silyl boronates and kotbu allows for roomtemperature coupling of cf and nh bonds effectively bypassing the prohibitively high barriers typically associated with thermally induced sn or sn amination the significant benefit of this transformation is the selective activation of the cf bond of the organic fluoride by silylboronate without transforming the potentially cleavable co ccl heteroarylch cn bonds and even cf groups a library of tertiary amines with aromatic heteroaromatic andor aliphatic groups was efficiently synthesized in a single step from electronically and sterically diverse organic fluorides nalkylanilines or secondary aminesaromatic tertiary amine moieties are key structural features of molecules found in pharmaceuticals agroscience bioactive natural products and materials science industries to date the most reliable way to afford aromatic tertiary amines is transitionmetalcatalyzed cspn coupling of aryl pseudohalides with amine nucleophiles such as ullmann coupling buchwaldhartwig reaction and metallaphotoredox amination indeed the efficient synthesis of aromatic tertiary amines continues to be one of the top five reactions performed globally with the aim of synthesizing highvalue products furthermore the perspective of green chemistry has always stimulated researchers towards the development of transitionmetalfree systemsgenerally transitionmetalfree amination of aryl pseudo halides suffers from drawbacks such as the use of a strong base high temperature and low regioselectivity however inert carbonfluorine cf bondcontaining organic fluorides have seldom been used in such cn couplings particularly under mild conditions owing to the high bond dissociation energy of the cf bond although the defluorinative amination of aryl fluorides has been well reported examples of the amination of electronrich aryl fluorides are very rare the defluoroamination of cspf bonds usually employs transitionmetal catalysis andor a strong base in addition amination regards to cleavage of cspf bonds are mostly limited to active benzyl or allylic fluorides while strong lewis acids usually required for aliphatic fluorides such as lansime and ybi therefore the activation of inert cf bonds in organic fluorides to afford aromatic tertiary amines under mild conditions remains highly challengingscheme  strategies for the dehaloamination of aryl halidesas a continuation of our studies on defluorinative functionalization we report the transitionmetalfree defluoronative amination of organic fluorides with secondary amines which proceeds with the cooperation of silylboronate and potassium tertbutoxide kotbu a wide variety of aryl fluorides and alkyl fluorides could react with secondary acyclic nalkylanilines cyclic nalkylanilines andor dialkylamines at room temperature smoothly affording a library of structurally aromatic tertiary amines in good to excellent yields via the cleavage of a cf bond in the presence of a silyl boronate without the assistance of transitionmetal catalysis or a photoredox system in this context the heteroaryl fluorides and secondary amine substrates investigated in this reaction are extensive unsubstituted nalkylanilines and substituted nmethylanilines react smoothly with a wide variety of aryl or alkyl fluorides this allows access to many structurally different aromatic tertiary amines that regioselectively incorporate aryl heteroaryl andor alkyl units at the nitrogen center in addition the defluoroamination reaction proceeds with high regio and chemoselectivity the potentially cleavable co bonds of ethers ccl bonds ccn bonds and csph bonds of heteroaromatic compounds most significantly the cspf bond of the trifluoromethyl cf and trifluoromethoxy ocf groups remained intact thus this mild silylboronatemediated selective defluoronative amination protocol might serve as a powerful tool

transformation first a few extended building blocks ad proceeded efficiently under optimal reaction conditions to afford the corresponding products aaad in up to  yield notably the sterically

corresponding products  ae  af  ag  ah  in moderate to good yields  furthermore various electrical properties fluoroarenes bearing extended building blocks were efficiently converted into the corresponding defluorinative amination products  in good to high yields remarkably the excellent chemoselectivity profile of this process is also well illustrated by the tolerance of the reaction conditions toward functional groups such as ethers k l and r cl m cn n and cf groups o p and q all of which could potentially be cleaved by cf bond activation for example naphthalenylphenyl ai  methylphenyl aj  ethercontaining biphenyl products ak  al  ar  and electronwithdrawingcontaining biphenyl products am  an  ao  ap  aq  were all obtained using this methodology in addition nitrogencontaining heteroaromatic fluorides s t p u v w and x were also successfully defluoroaminated with a under standard conditions in a relatively higher yield up to  as a nice result a number of pyridine derivatives as  at   au  av  and hpyrrole derivative aw  were welltolerated under the optimized conditions fluoroindole x and y and fluorobenzofuran z despite having several reactive aryl csph bonds also participated well in this transformation selectively furnishing defluorinative amination products ax  ay  az  via cf bond cleavage without the anticipated ch activated byproducts in light of the high functional group tolerance of this silylboronatemediated defluoroamination condition the applicability of the reaction was greatly expandedtable  substrate scope of fluoroarenes with

contrast both electrondonating ome f dioxole  g and electronwithdrawing cl h cl i and ocf j substituted nmethylanilines underwent defluoroamination to give the desired products in moderate yields fa

comparatively simple secondary amines such as morpholine q pyrrolidine r tetrahydroisoquinoline s and diethylamine t showed low reactivity in the presence of silylboronate and kotbu delivering the

reaction conditions however successful substrates were limited table  highly active benzyl fluorides ae were found to be very efficient in this silylboronatemediated coupling reaction therefore phenyl and cfo substituted benzyl fluorides a and b and fluoromethylnaphthalene c afforded the desired defluorinative aminated products in up to  yield aa  ba  ca  it should be noted that a and a could be successfully coupled to afford aa in  yield under identical reaction conditions in the absence of silylboronate however secondary benzyl fluoride fluoroethylnaphthalene d afforded the corresponding defluoroamination product da in  yield in contrast  of ea was formed using fluorodecane e and a under identical standard reaction conditionsfurthermore we examined the chemoselectivity of silylboronatemediated defluorinative amination scheme  under the same conditions chlorobiphenyl  was successfully transformed into the desired product aa in  yield whereas no silylated product was detected in contrast bromoand iodosubstituted biphenyl br  i  both formed a mixture of aminated and silylated products aa  and trace and biphenylyltrimethylsilane   and  respectively thus the excellent chemoselectivity of the cf bond over cclbri in this defluoronative aminationscheme  chemoselectivity regards to aryl halidesto gain insight into the reaction mechanism several control experiments were conducted under optimal reaction conditions scheme  left first as a side product  was used to probe the reaction pathway and no desired product aa was detected under the optimal reaction conditions which suggested that aryl silane  did not participate in any process of the whole reaction next we examined the defluoroamination of aryl fluoride a with a in the presence of tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl tempo scheme b although the coupling product aa was obtained in  yield under the standard conditions the yields decreased considerably as the amount of tempo increased   equiv equiv of tempo   equiv equiv of tempo and   equiv of tempo these results suggested that the crosscoupling reaction may involve radical species furthermore deuterated nmethylaniline da was also employed to conduct deuteration experiments under the optimal reaction conditions and the corresponding defluoroamination product daa was detected and isolated in  yield scheme c while daa was not observed therefore the generated nmethylaniline cation radical may not be involved in a singleelectron transfer process in addition radicalclock experiments of a and ncyclopropylaniline u were evaluated however the reaction only resulted in a complex mixture because the generated aminiumyl radical ions underwent a rapid ringopening process when the model reaction was conducted in the absence of a hydrazine  was formed in  isolated yield scheme e which could be explained by the dimerization of the nmethylanilino radical phnme these three control experiments indicate that the defluorinative cn crosscoupling reaction proceeds through a radical pathwaybased on both our experimental results and those of previous reports we propose a singleelectron transferradicalmediated carbosilylation reaction mechanism triggered by the known ability of kotbu to serve as a singleelectron reductant scehme  f first etsibpin reacts with a molecule of kotbu to form an intermediate a the formation of this intermediate was previously confirmed by the avasare group based on density functional theory calculations intermediate a was also confirmed by bnmr and sinmr studies an additional amount of kotbu triggered a singleelectron transfer process a single electron is transferred from the tbutoxy anion otbu to the silicon atom of intermediate a and a triethylsilyl radical siet is furnished via the cleavage of the sib bond along with the generation of otbu which is captured by borate anion b hydrogen abstraction from nmethylaniline  by siet gives nmethylaniline cation radical species c accompanied by the formation of hsiet detected by gcms the cation radicals can then release a hydrogen atom to afford nmethylanilino radical d which was supported by the formation of a decreased amount of aa under optimal reaction conditions in the presence of increased equivalents of tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl tempo thereafter the radical cascade process involving radical species d aryl fluoride  otbu and anion b occurs via transition state tsi in which the cf bond of aryl  is coactivated by the approach of k and a single electron of the boron atom in b cf bond cleavage accelerates with the approach of nmethylanilino radical species d eventually the desired crosscoupling product  or  was obtained with cn bond formation accompanied by the release of stable e bpinotbuk detected by b nmr and kf detected by f nmrin summary we developed the first silylboronatemediated radical alkylation of organic fluorides with benzyl ch bonds through inert cf bond activation at room temperature a variety of triarylmethanes and diarylalkanes were synthesized efficiently and smoothly in moderate to excellent yields under very mild conditions the most significant feature of this protocol is that a library of electronrich triarylmethane scaffolds was accessed for this reaction in addition this method avoids the use of transition metals and specialized ligands given the mild reaction conditions ease of execution and wide substrate scope of this protocol we believe that this strategy will spark the potential utility of triarylmethane and diarylalkane compounds in organic synthesis pharmaceuticals and functional materials further work on this defluorinative functionalization project is currently underwayabstract a wide variety of secondary acyclic nalkylanilines cyclic nalkylanilines and dialkylamines react with different organic fluorides under operationally simple conditions to provide a series of structurally diverse julolidines lilolidines and ringfused

resonator coupled with metalinsulatormetal tunnel diodedaisuke matsuura makoto shimizu and hiroo yugami department of mechanical systems engineering graduate school of engineering tohoku university  aoba  aramaki aobaku sendai japanemail makotoshimizuatohokuacjpin this study an optical rectenna that combines a hollow resonator with a metalinsulatormetal mim tunnel diode and is capable of photoelectric conversion at various visible and infrared wavelengths is proposed the mim tunnel diode was placed on the wall of the hollow resonator which enabled the induced current generated by the resonance of the magnetic field to be rectified the photoelectric conversion capability of the proposed structure applicable to visible light is experimentally demonstratedoptical rectennas enable direct rectification of electromagnetic waves at optical frequencies due to their adaptability over a wide range of wavelengths they are expected to enable effective solar energy conversion wasteheat utilization from moderate temperature sources and environmental thermal radiation energy harvesting the direct rectification of electromagnetic waves has already been demonstrated in the gigahertz range with efficiencies exceeding  oo extensive studies of rectennas at optical frequencies have been conducted in the last decade oo and several recent studies have reported the conversion of visible light or infrared thermal radiation into electricity oo the main challenges are the rectification of ultrahighfrequency alternating current  thz and effectively coupling the antennae and diodes several studies have improved ultrafast diode performance using metalinsulatormetal mim tunnel diodes oo however the number of studies on the overall optical rectenna system remains smallthe conventional microwave rectenna can couple multiple antennae with one diode because of the large spatial coherence of the incident microwaves which facilitates the rectification in contrast in optical rectennas each diode must be paired with only one antenna to avoid coherence loss oo because the coherence area of thermal radiation is as small as the radiations peak wavelength oo furthermore interactions between the electrical circuit and incident electromagnetic waves are not negligible because the size of the antenna is similar to size of the transfer linespreviously the concept of optical rectification was demonstrated using scanning tunneling microscopy experiments oo for applications to photoelectric conversion devices planar antennas coupled with mim tunnel diodes have been developed oo however because a tunnel gap of a few nanometers should be formed inplane for coupling with a planar antenna it is difficult to fabricate a wellcontrolled tunnel gap with high yield nevertheless davids et al reported a d grating structure that coupled with the longitudinal optical phonon mode in a nanometerscale sio tunnel layer for converting infrared light from thermal sources oo in this device because the mim tunnel diode integrated in the grating structure was vertically stacked it enabled the fabrication of a highly reliable tunnel layer that was a few nanometers thick for solar energy conversion sharma et al reported a carbon nanotubebased rectenna device oo that featured a vertically fabricated mim tunnel diode and anderson et al oo improved the conversion efficiency using a doubleinsulator tunnel diode the carbon nanotubes acted as both an optical antenna and an electrode with a low work function however in structures with antennae that are vertical relative to the substrate a rectenna structure with a freely controllable response wavelength range has not been reported this is because it is difficult to control the response range of vertically fabricated antennas in this frequency rangein this study we propose an optical rectenna device in which a hollow resonator is coupled with a layered mim tunnel diode as shown in fig  a metal microcavity structure is known to behave as a hollow resonator in which standing waves are generated inside the cavity oo in this cavity the wavelength of the electromagnetic resonance r can be expressed by a combination of standing waves in each dimension aswhere lx ly and lz are the length width and height of the cavity respectively and l m and n are integers representing the mode numbers in each dimensionin the proposed device an electromagnetic wave that satisfies the resonance condition of the cavity resonator forms electromagnetic standing waves at the antinode of the magnetic standing wave where the amplitude of the magnetic field is at its maximum inductive current oscillation occurs on the wall of the resonator the oscillating inductive current is rectified by mim tunnel diodes on the wall of the cavity as shown in fig  and can be extracted as electrical power because the wall of the cavity resonator plays the role of a mim tunnel diode the diode is directly coupled with the hollow antenna as shown in fig  this avoids the ohmic loss between the diode and the antenna as well as any unexpected effects on the optical properties of the line in addition because the tunnel layer is only a few nanometers thick the resonance wavelengths are derived only on the cavity sizeas indicated by eq  in this structure there is a proportional relationship between the absorption peak wavelength and the aperture size see fig a therefore it is possible to adapt to any wavelength range by controlling the cavity size furthermore the structure is symmetrical in the x and y directions which enables it to respond to all polarizations of light figure b shows the magnetic field distribution of the    mode ie l m n the nodes in the electric standing waves correspond to the antinodes in the magnetic standing waves therefore in the proposed structure the tunnel layer was positioned at the antinode of the magnetic standing wave this enables rectification at the maximum amplitude of the induced current on the cavity wallthe hollow resonators were fabricated using an electronbeam eb lithography process for this device a mim diode based on an oxygennonstoichiometry controlled homointerface structure which we previously used oo was applied the diode was composed of platinum pt titanium dioxide tio oxygennonstoichiometric tio tiox and titanium ti where x was estimated to be approximately  on average first a nm layer of ti was sputtered on half of the sio substrate subsequently a nm tio layer was deposited on the entire surface using atomic layer deposition a tiox natural oxidation layer that was  nm thick was also formed between the ti and tio then  nm of pt was sputtered onto the entire surface to fabricate the hollow resonators a double resist mask was formed because it was necessary to etch deep into the ti layer the double resist mask consisted of a photoresist layer a nm ti layer and an eb resist after the exposure and development of the eb resist the ti layer was etched via fast atom beam etching using sf plasma and then the photoresist layer was etched with o plasma finally the pt tio and ti layers were etched with sf plasma at the same time a groove with a width of  mm was formed around the hollow resonator and contact pad areas as shown in fig a this groove isolated the pt layer from the surroundings to prevent a short circuit between the pt and ti on the substrate the hollow resonator was fabricated as expected as shown in fig b however the aperture may have been slightly smaller at the bottom of the cavity than at the aperturepower generation tests were conducted using various light sources five lasers with different wavelengths     and  nm and light from a solar simulator the light source conditions are summarized in table i for each light source in the experiment every  s the light was turned on and was left on for  s after which it was turned off until another  s passed and then it was turned on again this process was repeated for a total of  s during this time the shortcircuit current and opencircuit voltage were measured using a source measuring unit keithley as shown in fig  the fabricated optical rectenna device clearly exhibited a response to all the light sources including the solar simulator light while the light was on the polarities of the observed shortcircuit current and opencircuit voltage were opposite which is a feature of rectenna operation the currents positive direction was from the pt to the ti but this direction is the opposite of that expected considering the difference between the work functions of pt and ti  ev and  ev respectivelyhowever this is consistent with the photonassisted tunneling effect derived from a semiclassical view because the energy of the photons is large the increase in the energy of the tunneled electrons due to photon absorption cannot be neglected as a result a voltage proportional to the voltage equivalent of the photon energy is added to the diode and the responsivity can be described as oowhere idc is the diode current v is the applied voltage q is the elemental charge h is plancks constant and n is the frequency of the light according to the properties of diodes as described in our previous paper oo the tunneling current from the pt to the ti increases as the applied voltage increases and the rectification direction is switched when the applied voltage is larger than  v in other words incident highenergy photons with a wavelength shorter than approximately  nm cause the sensitivity to become positive in the direction from the pt to the ti as indicated by eq the shortcircuit current and opencircuit voltage exhibited their highest magnitudes when the nm laser light and the solar simulator light were on which both had power densities approximately  times higher than those of the other light sources however the shortcircuit current and opencircuit voltage did not depend only on the power density as there were differences between the rectennas responses from the other lasers which had roughly equal power densities when the device was illuminated by the solar simulator light the shortcircuit current and opencircuit voltage decreased with time and exhibited opposite polarities after the light was turned on this may be due to the thermoelectromotive force caused by the temperature difference between the measurement probes the probe on the ti electrode was positioned closer to the power generation area which was hotter than the probe on the side of the pt electrode however this phenomenon was observed only when the solar simulator light was on because the total irradiation power was almost  times higher than that of the lasers therefore the signals observed while the light was being radiated were not caused by the thermoelectromotive force but by photoelectric conversion through the rectennathe fabricated structures absorptance obtained from the measured reflectance which has a peak corresponding to the    mode at  nm is shown in fig a the measured absorptance spectrum is in good agreement with the simulated absorptance spectrum for the cavity resonator indicating that the structure fabricated in this study functions as a resonator in this resonator the    mode appeared for the nm laser light and the highest efficiency was obtained for laser light at  nm which was close to the mode wavelength the power generation efficiency was estimated by multiplying the shortcircuit current and opencircuit voltage and dividing by the irradiated power the reason for the decrease in efficiency as the wavelength became shorter than  nm was the decrease in rectification performance this decrease occurred because the rc time constant for the rectenna decreased as the irradiation frequency increased as described in oo oo figures b c and d show the magnetic field amplitude oscillating in the xdirection in the resonator for incident light of   and  nm respectively figure b shows that the    mode was generated for nm light and the first and second antinodes from the top were positioned across the tunnel layer because their oscillation phases were inverted the current oscillations near the tunnel layer of the wall may have canceled each other out this was also the reason for the low conversion efficiency for the nm light figure c shows the magnetic field distribution for the incident light at  nm for which the    mode occurred although the amplitude of the magnetic field was not larger than that shown in fig b the magnetic field was localized near the tunnel layer because the aspect ratio of the fabricated structure increased figure d shows the resonant magnetic field distribution for the nm light because this wavelength was longer than  nm the cutoff wavelength of the resonator the electromagnetic wave could not enter the resonator in addition the rectifying polarity of this diode may have changed at  nm oo and the rectifying characteristics may have diminished hence the wavelength dependence of the photoelectric conversion efficiency was qualitatively valid considering the frequency dependence of the diode performance and the standing wave distribution of the electromagnetic waves generated in the resonator further analysis that will generate guidelines for optimal resonator design will be reported in the near futurethe measured shortcircuit current was approximately  times larger than that reported in previous studies on rectenna devices operated in the visible wavelength range with similar irradiation power densities oo oo in contrast the opencircuit voltage was smaller than that reported in previous studies by a factor of approximately  this may have occurred because the opencircuit voltage was reduced by the reverse leakage current in the tunnel diode inside the wall which is not thought to significantly contribute to photoelectric conversion further analysis is required to address this issue but solving this problem may greatly improve the conversion efficiency of the rectenna devicein this study we proposed an optical rectenna device that features a hollow resonator coupled with a mim tunnel diode the hollow resonators were arrayed in a square lattice and thus there was no dependence on the polarization of the incident light in general for the stable construction of the tunnel layer the mim diode must be formed vertical to the substrate plane however previous studies have shown that the operating wavelength of the rectenna is derived from the intrinsic properties of the material and is therefore not controllable in contrast the most significant feature of the proposed device is the controllability of the operating wavelength thus enabling the photoelectric conversion of thermal radiation over a wide range of wavelengthsour experiments demonstrated the performance of a device that responds to visible light wavelengths and it exhibited the highest photoelectric conversion efficiency for nm irradiation in addition to the best of our knowledge so far no other rectenna device has performed photoelectric conversion at wavelengths as short as  nm furthermore we have shown that the device can convert not only monochromatic light but also a broad solar spectrum although the opencircuit voltage was lower than previously reported values the shortcircuit current was approximately  times higher than that reported in previous studies even with similar irradiation power densitiesacknowledgmentsthis study was based on the results obtained

electrons and holes are injected from the charge transport layer ctl into the qd emissive layer eml to form excitons emitting light via radiative recombination therefore the operational mechanism is closely related to charge dynamics and exciton formation and it is essential to clarify the operational mechanism of qleds spectroscopic techniques have been applied to investigate exciton formation and recombination processes  according to the previous results on the charge injection mechanism to qds the different charge injection rates for electrons and holes cause selective injection of charge carriers at the initial stage of the lightemitting mechanism the injected charges electrons or holes in qds induce the injection of carriers with opposite polarity leading to the formation of excitons which results in light emission while the macroscopic understanding of electroluminescence el processes of qleds has been widely investigated the comprehensive in situ charge carrier dynamics in the qled operational process is not clear optoelectrical in situ measurements can provide more valuable information therefore optoelectrical insitu and nondestructive analysis would be strongly suggested for investigating the el mechanism within the operating devices transient electroluminescence trel analysis was performed to investigate the el process trel analysis does not damage the device during the measurement process which is suitable for analyzing the charge carrier dynamics that occur during device operation trel can be used to analyze the el process occurring in the device in chronological order the charge dynamics charge injection transport accumulation and recombination have been studied through trel analysis in previous reports the charge balance properties and charge injection efficiency in qleds were interpreted by trel measurements in the turnon region in addition the chargecarrier injectiondistribution in an operational qled was investigated by analyzing the rising and falling edges of the trel measurements despite these efforts charge injectionrecombination or annihilation mechanisms occurring in the process of qled operation are still not clearherein we conducted a comprehensive study of the optoelectrical properties of qleds to unveil the operational mechanism from the perspective of charge injection and transport dynamics we introduced a multilayered dichromatic eml structure that stacks two different qds emitting red and green colors the different time domains with emission colors were investigated using the trel measurements the fieldeffect electron mobility in the qd matrix was calculated and discussed for efficient radiative recombination dynamics in addition the factors affecting charge dissociation were decoupled and addressed separately we demonstrated the charge carrier dynamics related to injectionrecombination into the qds through trel analysis results and discussion trel measurement on multilayered double eml qledseach individual nanocrystal qd exhibits a quantum confinement effect which is distinguished from a bulk material these nanoscale features make it relatively difficult to analyze the electrical characteristics of qds thus several unclear points regarding the operational mechanism related to the charge transport and radiative recombination in the qd eml of the qleds are observed we performed trel measurements to investigate the charge carrier dynamics during the qled operation we adopted an inverted device structure of indium tin oxide itoznoqdbiscarbazolylbiphenyl cbpmooal as depicted in figure a redemitting cdsezncds and greenemitting cdsezncdses coreshell structured qds were used as emls the uvvis absorbance and pl spectra of the qds are shown in figure s to investigate the emission properties of the red and green qds we designed red rr and green gg emitting monochromatic eml qleds in addition to study the charge carrier dynamics that occur during the device operation process red and green qds were stacked to design a dichromatic eml qled structure qds were deposited sequentially in the redgreen rg or greenred gr order preventing solvent erosion and intermixing of multilayers is crucial for achieving reliable dichromatic emlstructured qleds in particular the qd eml is only a few tens of nanometers thick and can be easily damaged by solvents to confirm whether the qds were deteriorated by solvents during the manufacturing process of dichromatic eml a solvent hexane washing test was conducted no significant differences were observed in the electrical and optoelectronic characteristics of the devices figure s the el characteristics of the monochromatic and dichromatic doubleeml devices were analyzed the current density jvoltage vluminance l eqej and el spectra of the devices are shown in figure s and figure cd in monochromatic eml qleds the greenemitting device showed a lower current density than the redemitting device over the entire voltage range the green qled exhibited a turnon voltage of  v which was higher than that of the red qled  v furthermore green qleds showed a relatively lower efficiency than red qleds the maximum eqe was measured at a higher current density than that of the red qled these characteristics originated from the deep valence band energy level of the green qds figure b figure c and d show the voltagedependent el spectrum trends of the rg and gr dichromatic eml devices in both devices dominant light emission from the qds close to the hole transport layer htl was observed thus the electron and hole populations were the highest at the qdhtl interface which resulted in dominant radiative recombination of qds near the htl  furthermore the intensity of the green emission from both dichromatic eml devices was increased by increasing the voltage bias the hole injection was improved by overcoming the relatively large hole injection energy barrier with a high voltage bias to green qds indepth profiling of charge injection and recombination was investigated using trel measurements the trel system consists of a pulse generator and a streak camera for applying voltage pulses and measuring the intensity of light at a specific wavelength inset of figure e a voltage pulse was applied at a repetition rate of  khz pulse width  s and the el response of each device was measured on a nanosecond timescale figure e shows a representative schematic of the measured trel data we focused on two main parts the rising and falling edges of the el response the rising characteristic can be used to characterize the charge carrier dynamics inside the qleds when the device is turned on falling edge analysis was used to investigate the charge carrier dynamics of the charges accumulated in the qd or at the qdctl interface annihilating when the applied voltage is turned off radiative recombination process inside of qdfigure ab show the trel measurement data at the rising edge when the  v pulse was applied the emission spectrum over time indicates which qd layer is turned on at first in both devices the qd close to the electron transport layer etl initiated the light emission previous studies revealed the exciton formation and el emission according to the reports by y deng et al electron injects into the ground state neutral qd and forms a negatively charged intermediate qd state when the negatively charged qd is formed the hole injection barrier from htl to qd is lowered due to the coulomb attracting effects thereby the hole injection is accelerated in the above lightemitting process the time for a qd to be negatively charged  s is relatively longer compared to the time for charge is injected into the qd through the ctl   ns thus even the charge carriers already reached nearby the qds qds do not emit the light immediately rather electrons and holes are distributed inside of the qd layer before they participate in light emission process in the situation described the single dot experiment has proven that the neutral qd would not be positively charged by holes before they are negatively charged by electrons therefore the holes could pass through the qds close to the htl and reach the qd close to etl before they participate the radiative recombination process the delay time td in figure ab represents the time difference between the onset time of the applied voltage and the onset time of trel response in the rg device  ns was measured for red qd emission td rg r and  ns was measured for green qd emission td rg g for the gr device the initial emission time for green and red qds was about  ns td gr g and  ns td gr r respectively the delay time difference td in table  represents the time difference between the qds that initiate the emission the bottom qd close to etl and the qds that emit the different color the upper qd close to the htl the rg device exhibited the delay time difference of  ns td rg and the gr device exhibited the longer delay time difference of  ns td gr since the radiative recombination follows the procedure of negative charging and hole injection electron traveling and charging through the entire qd layer would be the prerequisite for the light emission in the case of rg device the upper green qds emit the light after electrons drift through the bottom red qds with a thickness of  nm electrons drift through the bottom green qds  nm and the upper red qds emit the light in the gr device the time difference would be originated by the electron mobility in each qd since electron traveled same distance figure sab shows the trel measurement result at the rising edge regarding the applied voltage bias in the rg device and gr device respectively as the applied voltage increased the decrease in td with steeper rise was observed in both devices charges are more effectively injected into the qds with higher voltage resulting faster light emission procedure moreover the electrons drift through the bottom qd layer more rapidly resulting a smaller td as shown in figure cd under the voltage bias condition qds emit the light sequentially as electron drift from the etlqd interface to the qdhtl interface by the electric field and the electron mobility in the qd eml during device operation could be extracted from the emission time difference with the following equationswhere v is the velocity of electrons f is the electric field and d is the thickness of the qd eml the actual voltage applied to the qd layer would be smaller than the entire voltage applied to the device because the qled is composed of a multilayer structure therefore the calculated mobility would be an underestimated value compared to the actual value lower bound electron mobility of the qd the td values of the rg and gr devices according to the applied voltage and the extracted lower bound electron mobility are summarized in table  the lower bound electron mobility showed the value of    cm v s and    cm v s for red and green qd respectively inset of figure cd to confirm further reliability we measured the space charge limited current sclc mobility for each qd by analyzing electrononly devices eods figure s shows the jv curves of the eods with red and green qds the extracted electron mobility values of red and green qd were    cm v s and    cm v s respectively from sclc model we confirmed that the mobility values were within the reliable range within the sclc mobility furthermore in a previously reported study the electron mobility was reported to be approximately    cm v s in cdsezns qd composite which is similar to our result although the sclc model is useful it is difficult to reflect the actual mobility during device operation moreover it is difficult to extract the mobility in an operating device trel measurements could be useful for analyzing the charge mobility of qds in an operating devicethe proposed radiative recombination mechanism inside the qd layer in the rg device is depicted in figure  i immediately after the electron is injected into the qd layer figure a and ii electron charges the bottom r qd iii a hole distributed inside the qd layer is injected into the negatively charged qd r qd by coulomb interaction iv an exciton r qd was formed and light was emitted in the bottom r qd figure b v the injected electrons are continuously moved by the electric field and negatively charge the encountered qds when the electrons reach the g qd vi the g qds are sequentially negatively charged g qd the g qds also emit light with the same radiative recombination process figure c vii hole injection and viii radiative recombination in the steady state luminescence mainly occurred in the upper qds close to the htl because of the high population of charge carriers near the htl charge annihilation dynamics at the falling edges of the trel measurementthrough the trel decay characteristics at the falling edge it is possible to understand the annihilation mechanism of charges accumulated in the qd layer or at the qdctl interface when the applied voltage bias is turned off the decay dynamics exhibit exponential decay characteristics the trel decay time constant was extracted by a double exponential fitting of the decay points the average trel decay time constant avg was calculated using the following equationthe fast component  represents the recombination of residual charges inside the eml and the slow component  represents the term related to the accumulated or trapped charges at the qdctl interface  figure a and d show the trel decay characteristics at the falling edges of monochromatic and dichromatic eml devices from red and green emission respectively at  v pulse for the red emission figure a the avg values of the rg and gr devices were  ns and  ns respectively which were longer than those of the monochromatic eml rr device  ns the green qds showed an opposite trend compared to the red qds at green emission figure d the avg value of gr and rg device were  ns and  ns respectively which were shorter than that of the monochromatic eml gg device  ns we speculated that this difference originated from the forster resonant energy transfer fret process from green qds with a larger bandgap to red qds with a smaller bandgap the avg value of the rg device was longer than that of the gr device at red emission and the avg value of the gr device was longer than that of the rg device for green emission both red and green qds showed longer avg values when located in the bottom layer as we discussed the charge population through the emission spectrum figure cd the concentration of charge carriers would be the highest near the qdhtl interface the high concentration of charge carriers at the qdhtl interface causes exciton quenching and nonradiative auger recombination in the qd layer  therefore the trel decay time becomes shorter for the upper qd figure s shows the trel decay trends of the monochromatic and dichromatic eml devices the avg values are presented in table sfigure be shows the avg value of monochromatic and dichromatic eml devices along with the applied voltages as the voltage bias increased the proportion of the fast component a increased and the avg value decreased in all devices the higher voltage the more charges were accumulated at the qdhtl interface and higher charge population caused exciton quenching and nonradiative auger recombination therefore the avg value became shorter as the voltage bias increased the avg value in a dichromatic eml device approached similar value as that of a monochromatic eml device when the applied voltage was increased this was caused by the increase in charge concentration at all qd layer when a high voltage was applied the avg value could be mainly affected by fret process nonradiative auger recombination and exciton quenching to quantitatively analyze the effect of fret the fret efficiency from the perspective of donor ed and accepter ea could be calculated by following equationswhere da and d  are the trel lifetimes of the donor g qd with and without the acceptor r qd and ad and a are the trel lifetimes of the acceptor with and without the donor respectively da and ad represent the avg of the dichromatic eml device and avg of the monochromatic eml device are represented by d and a respectively the calculated ed and ea values are summarized in table s although fret efficiency should be independent of the stacking order of qds they showed different values for the rg and gr devices because fret efficiency was calculated based on the avg value the avg value was affected not only by fret but also by exciton quenching and nonradiative auger recombination in the operating el device therefore the calculated fret efficiencies were different the influence of each factor fret exciton quenching and auger recombination can be analyzed from the difference in fret efficiency from the perspective of the donor g qd the ed values were calculated to be approximately  and  at  v for the rg and gr devices respectively compared to the gr device the rg device exhibited a larger ed value as there was an additional decrease in avg due to exciton quenching and nonradiative auger recombination at the g qdhtl interface as well as a decrease by fret as the applied voltage increased the effect of exciton quenching and nonradiative auger recombination increased and the ed value of the rg device tended to increase on the other hand the ed value did not change significantly depending on the applied voltage in the gr device because the g qds in the gr device were less affected by exciton quenching and nonradiative auger recombination thus the ed value of the gr device represents the fret efficiency without external effects which was  in other words the difference in the ed value between the two devices would exhibit an effect caused by exciton quenching and nonradiative auger recombination the difference tended to be proportional to the applied voltage and showed a value of  this indicates that a high concentration of charge population near the qdhtl interface produced additional charge annihilation processes from the perspective of the acceptor r qd the ea values for the rg and gr devices were  and  under  v for rg and gr device respectively the gr device exhibited a relatively small ea value because the avg value was affected by exciton quenching and nonradiative auger recombination at the r qdhtl interface the effect of this factor can also be obtained through the difference in the ea it was  at  v and it increased as the applied voltage increased and  at  v in short charge annihilation was affected by  by fret and  by exciton quenching and nonradiative auger recombination depending on the applied voltageto gain a better understanding of the charging of qds we performed transient pl spectroscopy the change in qd pl decay lifetime according to the applied bias in the qled provides information about the charging of qds figure s shows the transient pl decay dynamics of qds in qleds under an applied bias the voltagedependent pl lifetimes are summarized in table s the pl lifetime becomes shorter under positive bias owing to the increasing negatively charged qd caused by excess electrons in the red emission the gr device exhibited a large decrease in pl lifetime by  under  v bias whereas a relatively small decrement in rr by  and rg by  devices in the case of green emission there was a relatively large decrease in the rg device by  compared to the gg by  and gr by  devices both red and green qds showed a larger decrease in pl lifetime if they were deposited in the upper layer this implies that the upper layer qd became more negatively charged by electrons accumulating at the qdhtl interface this result is consistent with the trel analysis where nonradiative auger recombination and exciton quenching are dominant near the qdhtl interface on the other hand a negligible change in the pl lifetime was observed under reverse bias which means that the qd in the device is negatively charged only when a positive bias is applied conclusionin summary we investigated the operation mechanism related to charge injection and recombination during device operation by analyzing the qled emission characteristics on a nanosecond timescale the qled el process can be expressed as follows first electrons are injected into the neutral qd and then form a negatively charged qd forming an exciton followed by a hole injection the formed excitons emit light through radiative recombination the time for qd formation is longer than the time for charge to be injected into the eml therefore electrons and holes are injected into the eml before exciton formation electrons are injected into the qd close to the etl with a high electron population and emit light as electrons drift in the opposite direction light emission occurs in the qd close to the htl sequentially thus in the dichromatic eml device stacked with qds emitting different colors there is a difference in the time each color emits light and this can be used to extract electron mobility within qds in the process of qled operation electrons are more easily injected into the eml than holes because of the low injection barrier the electrons accumulate at the qdhtl interface over time and the population of charges at the qdhtl interface becomes the highest a high population of charges causes nonradiative recombination when the qd is farther from the qdhtl interface it exhibits a longer decay time owing to the suppressed emission quenching of the qds in particular in the dichromatic qleds the effects of fret exciton quenching and nonradiative auger recombination on charge annihilation were analyzed the effect of fret was measured at a similar level regardless of the applied voltage as the higher voltage was biased a high concentration of charge population near the qdhtl interface induces additional charge annihilation processes such as exciton quenching and auger recombination mitigating charge accumulation in the device along with the development of qds with suppressed auger recombination will enable improvements in device performance we elucidated the operation mechanism related to the charge carrier dynamics of the qleds this understanding could

batteriesabstract spinel mgmno an alternative mgion battery cathode material shows great promise because of its high redox potential however large volume changes and polarizations occur because of the phase transitions between the tetragonal mgmno and cubic mgmno phases during the mg insertionextraction process which reduce the cycling stability and coulombic efficiency herein we developed an efficient method to prepare cubic spinel mgmno cathode materials by annealing bimetallic mofs the cubic spinel mgmno cathode exhibits excellent cycling stability even at a high rate owing to its wellconfined hierarchical structure with fast ion diffusion channels given the highly ordered selfprotective structure of mgmno units a selfactivation effect is gradually conducted during the cycling process which is crucial for improving the kinetics of mg ions in the host spinel structure this activation endows the mgmno cathode with an obvious platform at  v vs mgmg in full cells which may provide novel insights for developing highperformance mgion battery cathode materialsintroductionmgion batteries mibs exhibiting great potential as alternatives to liion batteries have attracted extensive attention owing to the high volumetric capacity low cost and dendritefree of mg anode however the strong interaction between mg and anions of host lattices restricts the diffusion of mg in cathode materials leading to low rate capability within mibs to tackle this inherent bottleneck spinel oxides such as mgmno mmo were synthesized and further investigated for mib cathode materials which showed relatively high mg diffusivity due to their d ion diffusion pathway nevertheless a large volume change and polarization occurs because of the phase transitions between the tetragonal mmo and cubic mmo phases during the mg insertionextraction process which reduces the cycling stability and coulombic efficiency as such developing a feasible method that can suppress the lattice distortion of mmo cathode materials is highly desiredto date the cubic mmo phase can be prepared at high temperature which may transform the chargedischarge process into reversible cubiccubic phase transitions however the cubic mmo phase obtained at high temperature is metastable during the cooling process to solve this problem our group has synthesized nanosized cubic mmo at low temperatures improving the cycling stability of cathode materials although the diffusion pathway in nanosized mmo is greatly shortened the increased unstable surface is exposed to the electrolyte and the reconstruction of the mmo surface occurs the fresh surface phase such as the rocksalt phase inhibits the insertionextraction of mg leading to decreased cycling stability and rate performance therefore there is an urgent need to design a rational structure retaining the activity of nanosized mmo for longlife and highrate mibsmetalorganic frameworks mofs contain highly dispersed metal ions between organic ligands pyrolysis of mofs is an appealing approach for preparing wellorganized metal or metal oxide clusters with uniformly distributed porous structure herein a bimetallic mof mgmnmof was employed to synthesize spinel mmo with a cubic phase for mib cathode materials the mmo nanoparticles  nm in diameter were confined in an orderly manner in the porous units selfprotection units with selfassembly ion diffusion pathways endow the mmo cathode with excellent cycling stability at a high rate  capacity retention after  cycles at  ma g given the highly ordered selfprotective structure a selfactivation effect was demonstrated after several cycles which endowed the mmo cathode with an obvious platform at  v vs mgmg in full cellsresults and discussionmgmn bimetallic mof mgmnmof with an mgmn atomic ratio of  was prepared by a solvothermal method figure s and table s a scanning electron microscopy sem image revealed that the mgmnmof particles m in diameter were relatively smooth figure sa the sharp peaks in the xrd pattern indicate the high orderliness of the asprepared mgmn bimetallic mof which is consistent with the reported work thermogravimetric analysis tga shows that the obtained mgmnmof decomposes completely above  c figure sc then mgmnmof was annealed in air at different temperatures   and  c for  h to obtain mgmno samples denoted as mmo mmo and mmo respectively the xrd patterns of mmo and mmo figure a show that the major fingerprint peaks can be indexed to the cubic mgmno spinel phase jcpds card no  because the atomic ratio of the prepared mmo is mgmn   a slight shift of the peaks can be attributed to the different atomic ratios of mgmn a weak peak located at  was identified as the  plane of the tetragonal mgmno phase jcpds card no  with enhanced crystallinity as the annealing temperature increased when the annealing temperature was increased to  c a new fingerprint peak appeared at   which was indexed to the  plane of the tetragonal mgmno phase the xrd results demonstrate that the amount of the tetragonal mgmno phase increases as the annealing temperature increases from  c to  c after calcination the particles became smaller and rougher than those of the mof units figure b and sa numerous nanoparticles with a diameter of  nm were piled up in order to build the secondary particles figure c a highresolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem image shows that dspacing of the nanoparticle lattice fringe is  nm which is a little wider than that of  plane of cubic mgmno phase figure d for comparison a twostep annealing treatment of mgmnmof was performed after pyrolysis in an ar atmosphere at  c the precursor was annealed in air at different temperatures  denoted as mmo mmo and mmo the xrd patterns showed that the phases of the three samples were all composed of cubic and tetragonal phases figure sfigure  a xrd patterns of mmo mmo and mmo b sem micrograph c tem micrograph and d hrtem micrograph of mmoto investigate the impact of the cubic and tetragonal phases on the electrochemical properties of the mgmno based electrodes the electrochemical performance of different mgmno electrodes was investigated in mib halfcells at  c the cycling performance conducted at  ma g showed that the mmo and mmo electrodes composed mainly of the cubic phase displayed a higher capacity than the other electrodes figure a the mmo electrode showed a capacity of  mah g at the nd and th cycles indicating superior cycling stability the dischargecharge voltage profiles of the mmo electrode show that the first  cycles are gradual activation processes figure b in each cycle the charge capacity was slightly higher than the discharge capacity indicating that a few extra mg ions may be extracted from the mmo during each charging process during the activation process the dischargecharge platform gradually rises to a high potential and then stabilized between  v vs ac activated carbon after  cycles highvoltage platforms and low polarizations are useful for mib cathode materials moreover cubic mgmncoo was prepared using the same procedure which delivered a higher capacity than that of the mmo electrode figure s this method can be extended to the preparation of a series of spinel oxides for highperformance mib cathodesin addition mgmno nanoparticles were prepared by the traditional pechini method for comparison denoted as pechinimmo the sem micrograph shows that the pechinimmo nanoparticles were piled up into micronsized secondary particles similar to the mofderived samples figure sa the crystallographic features of pechinimmo examined through xrd confirmed that all fingerprint peaks matched well with the planes of the tetragonal mgmno phase figure sb after  cycles the pechinimmo electrode showed a discharge capacity of  mah g at  ma g which was much lower than that of the mmo electrode figure sc furthermore the discharge platform of the pechinimmo electrode disappeared at  mah g figure sd whereas that of the mmo electrode was stable until  mah g the comparison between mmo and pechinimmo further demonstrated the superior mg storage performance of the cubic mmo phasefigure  a discharge capacities of different mmo electrodes in  cycles at  ma g b dischargecharge curves of mmo electrode at  ma g between  v vs acthe rate performance was conducted in three stages to eliminate interference from the activation process figure a the rate capabilities were almost the same for the mmo electrode before and after activation after activation the mmo electrode delivered discharge capacities of     and  mah g at current densities of     and  ma g respectively demonstrating an outstanding rate capability the dischargecharge voltage profiles of the mmo electrode after activation exhibit a stable voltage platform and a slight polarization phenomenon even at a high current density figure b furthermore the mmo electrode exhibited capacities of  and  mah g in the nd and th cycles at  ma g respectively indicating excellent cycling stability at high rates figure c the high rate capability and excellent cycling stability are attributed to the ordered accumulation of mmo nanoparticles providing channels for ion diffusion and stabilization moreover the dominant role of the cubic mmo phase is to reduce the jahnteller effect which impedes harmful transitions between the tetragonal and cubic phasesthe cv curves of first  cycles were measured at a scan rate of  mv s figure s as the cycling proceeded a pair of redox peaks located at  v appear and gradually intensified which is consistent with the trend of the dischargecharge voltage profiles after the activation process the cv peaks of the mmo electrode exhibited similar contours with increasing scan rate from    mv s figure d furthermore a linear relationship between the peak current and the scan rate was observed inset of figure d the mg ion storage mechanism of the mmo electrode was investigated by cv techniques figure sthe pseudocapacitive contribution to the total capacity estimated through cathodic and anodic peak currents respectively were  and  at  mv s which indicates that the mg insertion process is faster than its extraction processfigure  a rate performance of mmo electrode at a range of current densities of  ma g b dischargecharge curves of mmo electrode at various current densities between  v vs ac c the cycling performance of mmo electrode in  cycles at  ma g d cv curves of mmo electrode at different scan rates from  to  mv s inset of d is the relationship between the peak currents and the scan ratesto clarify the activation process of the mmo electrode in the mib halfcells xas measurements were performed in different chargedischarge states figure a the mn kedge energy of pristine mmo was similar to that of mno the mn kedge energy of the first discharged electrode disst is shifted to a lower energy than that of the pristine electrode and is similar to that of mno which demonstrates the reduction of mn ions during discharge after the recharging process chast the mn kedge energy is returned to high energy which is slightly higher than that of the pristine electrode furthermore after  cycles the mn kedge energy of the charged electrode chath was much higher than that of chast and was located between those of mno and limno these results indicate the gradual oxidation of mn ions during cycling which proves the gradual activation process observed from the dischargecharge voltage profiles the fourier transforms of the mn kedge exafs spectra show that a sharp single peak of the chath spectrum located at   appeared figure b indicating that the cubic and tetragonal mixture phase was transformed to the cubic phase this transformation further demonstrates that the gradual activation process is beneficial for mib performancefigure  a mn kedge xanes spectra b fourier transforms of mn kedge exafs spectra and c highresolution xps spectra of mg s for mmo electrode at different chargedischarge stateshighresolution xps spectra of mg s show that the peak intensity increases in the discharge state and decreases in the charge state corresponding to the insertion and extraction processes of mg respectively figure c the mn p peak is shifted to a lower energy after the discharging process and returns to a high energy after the charging process figure s further demonstrating the reduction and oxidation process furthermore the gradual activation process can be verified by the evolution of the atomic ratio of mgmn table s the mgmn ratio of pristine mmo was  whereas those of chast and chath were  and  respectively the dramatic change in the mgmn ratio and large shifting of the mn p peaks are more obvious than the change in the xas results which show that the activation process and structural transition mainly occur at the surface of mmo because the xps detection depth is only a few nanometers the activation process widened the mg diffusion channels improving the electrochemical performance of the mmo cathodefigure  chargedischarge curves of mg full cells at  ma g with a pristine mmo cathode and b activated mmo cathodemmo electrodes before and after activation were assembled into mib full cells and tested at  c figure  the ndcycle discharge capacity of the activated mmo electrode was  mah g at  ma g while that of the mmo electrode was only  mah g furthermore the platform of the activated mmo electrode in full cells was observed at approximately  v vs mgmg demonstrating an effective activation effect for mib applications the gradual decrease in the capacity in subsequent cycles can be attributed to the instability of the electrolyte and passivation of the mg anode which are common problems in mib systemsconclusionsin summary we developed an efficient strategy to prepare cubic spinel mgmno for highperformance mib cathodes by annealing bimetallic mofs given the wellconfined hierarchical structure with fast ion diffusion channels the cubic spinel mmo cathode exhibited high cycling stability  capacity retention after  cycles at  ma g and excellent rate performance  mah g at  ma g and  capacity retention after  cycles we demonstrate that a selfactivation effect gradually occurs during the cycling process owing to the highly ordered selfprotection structure of the mmo units the activation endows the mmo cathode with an obvious platform at  v vs mgmg in full cells which holds great promise for future energystorage applicationsassociated

level therefore the results of this study could be important for future designs of antimicrobial stewardship programmes in primary care settingswe believe that this protocol is appropriate for publication by bmj open since the scope of the trial can help to improve antibiotic prescription in primary care which is the healthcare level with the highest antibiotic consumption in most countries worldwidetitlecorresponding authorauthor affiliationsword countabstractintroduction antibiotic overuse is directly related to antibiotic resistance and primary care is one of the main reasons for this overuse this study aims to demonstrate that including experts on infectious diseases id within the antimicrobial stewardship ams team of primary care achieves higher reductions in overall antibiotic consumption and increases the quality of prescriptionmethods and analysis a multicentre clusterrandomised blinded clinical trial will be conducted between  and  three primary care centres will be randomly assigned to an advanced ams or a standard ams advancedams consists of a standardams combined with the possibility that general practitioners gp discuss patients therapies with id experts  telephonically during working days and biweekly meetings the main endpoint will be overall antibiotic consumption defined as daily defined dose per  inhabitants per day dhd secondary endpoints are  unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions in patients diagnosed with upper respiratory tract or urinary tract infection  adequacy of antibiotic prescription  reattendance to gp or emergency room within  days after the initial gp visit and  hospital admissions for any reason within  days after the gp visit two secondary endpoints unnecessary antibiotic therapy and adequacy of therapy will be evaluated by blinded investigatorssample size we selected three clusters centres per arm coverage of  inhabitants which allows rejection of the null hypothesis of equal consumption with a power of  assuming a moderate intracluster correlation of  an intracluster variance of  and a mean difference of  dhd the type i error is set at ethics and dissemination the protocol was reviewed and approved by the local ethics committees the publication of this study will follow the recommendations of the international committee of medical journal editorsintroductionthe rapid spread of untreatable multidrugresistant mdr bacteria poses a serious threat to global public health  causing up to  attributable deaths annually by  global estimates predict that bacterial resistance will be responsible for  million deaths every year and healthcare costs will exceed  billion eurosantimicrobial resistance is directly associated with antimicrobial misuse which mostly refers to unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions according to the world health organization countrylevel efforts to reduce unnecessary antimicrobial consumption are key to preventing the worldwide rise of mdr bacteriaspain is among the european countries with the highest rates of antibiotic consumption in  the average consumption of antibiotics was  defined daily doses per  inhabitants per day dhd most of which  dhd was consumed in the primary care setting moreover the spanish national health system reported that  million antibiotic prescriptions were dispensed from outpatient pharmacies  of which were inappropriate in the primary care setting these inappropriate prescriptions are mostly driven by antibiotic misuse for treating nonbacterial respiratory tract infections and by using broadspectrum antibiotics for treating infections for which a narrower spectrum of antibiotics is indicated additionally another cause of concern at the primary care level is overtreatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria particularly in older patients different antimicrobial stewardship ams programmes have shown their efficacy in reducing antibiotic consumption in both the hospital and primary care settings many of the successful experiences included multidisciplinary teams which also increased the quality of antibiotic prescriptionsthe european society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases has recently elaborated a consensus document stating that healthcare providers who prescribe antibiotics should know about infectious diseases in this regard different societies recommend including experts in infectious diseases id in their ams teams however these recommendations are particularly focussed on hospital settingsthis study aims to assess the impact of including id experts within the ams team in the primary care setting on antibiotic consumption and prescription quality in patients diagnosed with upper respiratory tract and urinary tract infectionshypothesiscentres including id experts as part of their primary care ams advancedams will decrease antibiotic consumption and improve the quality of prescription without increasing the number of patients who reattend to the general practitioner gp

email yoshinokskyorinuacjpabstractalthough acute aortic syndrome aas has a poor prognosis in the acute phase little is known about the hyperacute phase of the disease prior to hospital arrival the aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical picture of aas prior to hospital arrival by investigating the prevalence of intramural hematoma imh and classic aortic dissection with a patent false lumen pfl in patients with aas who developed cardiopulmonary arrest on arrival cpaoa due to cardiac tamponade among the patients with cpaoa the prevalence of imh and pfl with massive pericardial effusion was evaluated by plain computed tomography ct as well as among alive aas patients upon arrival with cardiac tamponade during the same period among consecutive  patients with cpaoa  patients presenting with massive pericardial effusion were selected of these  patients underwent plain ct and  patients were diagnosed with stanford type a aortic dissection of these  patients  were diagnosed with imh and   were diagnosed with pfl among consecutive  alive patients with aas during the same period  patients were diagnosed with type a of whom   were diagnosed with imh and   with pfl the frequency of developing cardiac tamponade tended to be higher in the imh group than in the pfl group  of   vs  of   p the prevalence of imh among these patients with cardiac tamponade   was the same as that in patients with cpaoaaas the early prognosis of type a imh is worse than expectedkey words aortic dissection imh cardiac tamponade sudden deathacute aortic syndrome can be classified into two types based on the presence of early obstruction of the false lumen by thrombus or intramural hematoma imh or whether there is a patent false lumen pfl the socalled classic aortic dissection the pathology of the hyperacute stage of acute aortic syndrome has not been fully elucidated thanks to the widespread use of computed tomography ct it has become easy to make a diagnosis of imh in the acute stage interestingly there is a marked difference in the reported incidence of imh between western countries and asian countries the incidence of imh has been reported to be about  in western countries but is far higher at  in asian countries our previous study as well as those of kaji et al and moisumi et al have indicated that the outcome of imh was better than that of pfl in patients with stanford type a type a dissection in contrast reports from western countries suggest a similarly poor outcome of type a dissection irrespective of whether patients have imh or pfl thus there seem to be differences with respect to the incidence and outcome of type a imh between western and asian patientsfew studies have investigated acute aortic syndrome before admission to the hospital and to compare the incidence of imh and pfl among patients who died upon arrival therefore we investigated patients with acute aortic syndrome who were transported to our hospital in a state of cardiopulmonary arrest on arrival cpaoa since cardiac tamponade is the most serious complication of acute aortic syndrome and has a major influence on the outcome we compared the incidence of imh among cpaoa patients with acute aortic syndrome who apparently died of cardiac tamponade to that among patients with type a acute aortic syndrome who came to the hospital alivemethodssubjectsamong  patients excluding patients with cardiopulmonary arrest due to either injury or suicide from consecutive  patients in the state of cpaoa who were admitted to kyorin university hospital a core emergency care hospital in the western part of tokyo between january  and april   patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography due to cardiac enlargement observed on plain chest radiography ctr   figure  among them  patients were selected with a significant pericardial effusion on echocardiography thick enough to affect hemodynamics  mm by an apical approach of the  patients  underwent plain ct the remaining  patients did not undergo ct study for the following reasons  patients had apparent dyspnea and were diagnosed with congestive heart failure due to significant pulmonary congestion on chest radiography  patients underwent immediate fenestration and were diagnosed with bloody pericardial effusion and in  patients their family did not agree with the examinationthese  patients  male and  female aged  years mean  years were classified into the cpaoa group all patients were confirmed to have died upon arrival at the hospital on the other hand the number of patients who were transferred alive to the emergency department of our hospital during the same period and were diagnosed with acute aortic syndrome was  of whom  patients were type a  males and  females aged  years mean  years and were classified into the noncpaoa groupdefinition of cpaoathe diagnostic criteria of cpaoa comprised of either cardiac arrest in which a patient had no response and had stopped both respiration and circulation or respiratory arrest in which a patient had stopped voluntary respiration but had neither been in the state of nor confirmed of circulatory arrest either of which was confirmed upon arrival to the emergency department of our hospitaldefinition of a significant pericardial effusionpatients presenting with echofree space with a thickness of  mm on an apical echocardiography scan at the time of arrival as well as abnormal lowdensity lesions in the pericardial space with a thickness of  mm on plain ct were defined as having a significant pericardial effusion figure  for echocardiography a philips sonos  eindhoven the netherlands with a  hz transducer was useddiagnosis of aortic dissectiona diagnosis of acute aortic dissection in the noncpaoa group was made by a sudden onset of chestback pain and ct examination all cases were diagnosed on the day of onset by ct examination using a toshiba medical systems asteion tsx tokyo japan ct examination included plain computed tomography ct examination followed by contrastenhanced ct in contrastenhanced ct  ml of nonionic contrast agents were administered intravenously over  seconds and pictures were taken  seconds after the initiation of administration ct slices of  cm thickness were taken from the aortic arch to the aortoiliac bifurcationdiagnosis of acute aortic dissection in the noncpaoa group by ct examination or the differential diagnoses of imh and pfl were based on previous reports that is imh was diagnosed when a typical ringshaped symmetric or asymmetric highdensity lesion was observed at the aortic wall in a plain ct image figure  while pfl was diagnosed when a patent false lumen was enhanced the stanford classification was used as a clinical classification systemin the cpaoa group as soon as pericardial effusion was confirmed by echocardiography in the emergency room a plain ct examination was performed  they were also classified into imh and pfl using the same ct criteria as in the noncpaoa group that is imh was diagnosed when a typical ringshaped symmetric or asymmetric highdensity lesion was observed while pfl was diagnosed when a flapshaped highdensity lesion was observed three cardiologists independently diagnosed each patient and if there was a disagreement such cases were excluded from the radiological diagnosis of aortic dissectionpatients with type a dissection complicated with cardiac tamponade in noncpaoa group were compared to patients with a significant pericardial effusion in cpaoa groupethical informationthe study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the  declaration of helsinki in line with the ethical guidelines for epidemiological research by the japanese government this retrospective study was approved by the kyorin university institutional review board and the need for informed consent was waived the study protocol clearly mentioned that if the patients families desired they could opt

years mean  years were diagnosed with type a acute aortic syndrome in the remaining  patients one patient  had chronic heart failure and the other two patients were suspected of having acute aortic syndrome based on clinical symptoms although a clear diagnosis could not be obtained by plain ct examination the list of the cpaoa groups is shown in table  aortic dissection was not detected in  patients who did not undergo a ct examination all  patients died upon arrival at the emergency room in the  patients the mean time from emergency call to hospital arrival was  minutesamong the

there were no differences in sex age history of hypertension and maximum diameter of the ascending aorta between the imh and pfl in the cpaoa groupof the  patients with type a who were alive upon

presented with cardiac tamponade cardiac tamponade was observed in  of  patients with imh  and  of  patients with pfl  thus the frequency tended to be higher in imh although the difference was not statistically significant pthe comparison between  cpaoa patients and  noncpaoa patients with cardiac tamponade showed no difference in sex history of hypertension or maximum diameter of the aorta although the age in cpaoa was higher than that in noncpaoa  vs  p among patients with pericardial effusion in the noncpaoa group  patients  presented with imh and  patients  with pfl thus the fraction of imh tended to be higher in patients with pericardial effusion than in patients without pericardial effusion although the difference was not statistically significant the fraction of imh in patients with pericardial effusion in the noncpaoa group was the same as that in patients with aortic dissection in the cpaoa group  vs  respectivelydiscussionin the present study patients with cpaoa excluding those who died of trauma in whom cardiac tamponade was probably the direct cause of death were investigated retrospectively when plain ct scans were reviewed acute aortic dissection was found to be the underlying disease in most of these patients and the incidence of imh was noted in more than half of the patients all subjects in the present study had cpaoa and death was confirmed at the emergency outpatient clinic in all cases echocardiography and thoracoabdominal ct scanning without contrast medium were performed to identify the causes of death there have been no previous studies on the classification of the dissected aortic wall imh or pfl among patients with acute aortic syndrome prior to hospital arrival the present study showed that the incidence of imh was high in the cpaoa group with pericardial effusion as well as in the noncpaoa group with cardiac tamponade it was previously reported that the incidence of pericardial effusion was similar in type a patients with imh and pfl who were alive on arrival since there were no other obvious reasons for death to have occurred in the cpaoa patients with pericardial effusion cardiac tamponade was considered to have led to the onset of cardiac arrest accordingly the present study suggested that the incidence of imh was higher than that reported previously and that it was associated with the lethal complication of cardiac tamponade which would have an important influence on the outcome of acute aortic syndrome in the hyperacute stageuchida et al  reported that the thickness of the residual media on the adventitia side in patients with imh was thinner than that in patients with pfl in other words dissection in a layer more prone to rupture toward the adventitia may contribute to susceptibility to aortic rupture or pericardial hemorrhage in patients with imh it is unclear why imh is more prone to dissection on the adventitia side of the media than pflimh and pfl are regarded as different diseases however it has been suggested that the pathology of these two conditions may be closely related  because a transition from imh to pfl has often been observed and because a very thin aortic wall characteristic of imh has been detected after  hours in patients with pfl although it has become more difficult to distinguish between imh and pfl this distinction is still made when discussing the outcome and therapeutic strategies in many reports therefore imh and pfl were distinguished from each other according to conventional methods in the present studythe present study revealed that the characteristic ct findings of imh observed in living patients were also observed in patients with cpaoa contrastenhanced ct scanning was not performed in patients with cpaoa because they were in a state of cardiac arrest  since ct was performed in the absence of heart beating the intimal flap of the aortic wall and dissection in the aortic medial layer could be observed easily and clearly on plain ct scans as shown in the representative cases patients in whom these findings were observed were classified as having a pfl in the present series of  patients with cpaoa it was easy to distinguish between imh and pflafter the onset of acute aortic dissection patients may experience sudden death from serious acute complications such as cardiac tamponade aortic rupture and acute myocardial infarction according to nakashima et al  who reviewed  autopsy cases of aortic dissection aortic rupture was noted in  of these patients and the relative incidence of cardiac tamponade in these patients was  aortic rupture in the absence of cardiac tamponade accounted for  of the patients our recent study that examined a series of around  outofhospital cardiac arrest ohca patients who underwent plain ct showed that  of the  patients with ohcpa were diagnosed with acute aortic dissection and  out of  patients  with type a acute aortic syndrome died due to massive bloody pericardial effusionin the present study the incidence of type a imh was  in all patients with type a acute aortic syndrome in the noncpaoa group according to other reports from asian countries including japan the incidence of type a imh is  which is higher than the incidence reported in western countries approximately  this marked difference in the incidence of imh is presumably ascribable to differences between countries with respect to diagnostic techniques and the proportion of patients with severe imh who die before arrival at hospital in japan thoracoabdominal ct scanning which is less invasive than transesophageal echocardiography is mainly used to examine the aorta even when the aortic wall is thin imh can be easily diagnosed based on the characteristic highdensity area in the aortic wall on plain ct scans in the reports from western countries a diagnosis of imh is made when the thickness of the aortic wall is  mm on ct scans or transesophageal echocardiography we have already reported that if the diagnostic criterion of an aortic wall thickness  of  mm was applied approximately half of the patients with type a imh might be missed resulting in potential underestimation of the incidence of imhit is also suspected that the percentage of imh patients who are hospitalized alive is lower in western countries because imh patients with cardiac tamponade may die early before arriving at the hospitalclinical implications many studies have shown that complications of cardiac tamponade are the most serious risk even in patients who survive hospitalization in type a acute aortic syndrome with massive pericardial effusion imh was more common than pfl in both cpaoa and surviving patients although many reports from japan and other asian countries have shown that type a imh has a better prognosis than pfl our results show that imh does not have a better prognosis than pfl in type a acute aortic syndrome therefore type a imh with even a small amount of pericardial fluid is a severe risk that can be expected to deteriorate rapidly even if the patient is hemodynamically stable and surgical treatment should be actively considered for type a imh cases with pericardial effusionlimitationsin the present study cpaoa patients with aortic rupture and massive intrathoracic hemorrhage without pericardial effusion were not investigated in the future it will also be necessary to study patients with massive hemothorax or mediastinal hemorrhage the number of cases was small we performed simple ct in only  cases of suspected pericardial effusion from over  cases of cpa and discriminated imh and pfl in less than half of the cases considering that approximately  of cpa cases contained type a acute aortic syndrome the number of patients who survived and came to the hospital was relatively small at one institution and should be studied in a larger number of patientsconclusionsmost cpaoa patients with significant pericardial effusion had acute aortic dissection among these patients the incidence of imh was slightly higher than that of pfl and similar results were obtained by investigating patients with cardiac tamponade who were alive upon arrival at the hospital accordingly the outcome of imh is not necessarily better than that of pfl and the acute outcome of imh needs to be improved by early surgical treatment especially in patients with the

GZWQH_49_Subcultural_Difference_in_positive_affect_between_Han_and_Uyghur_Chinese_input.json,Research paper_Journal article,3598,0, 29,0,12,Introduction Methods MRI Data Acquisition Data Preprocessing Statistical Analysis Results Questionnaire Data Brain Structures of PA Moderation analysis Discussion Limitations Conclusion,subcultural difference in pa between han and uyghur chinese the moderating role of dacc gray matter volumepurpose affect is generated by adapting to the environment and positive affect pa related to personal growth and development is more susceptible to culture previous research has shown that han chinese have more emotion regulation and less positive emotional experience than uyghur chinese however the neural mechanisms underlying this behavior remain unknown in the current study we examined the relationship between anatomical variations in brain structure and pa and then explored how parelated brain structures modulate the subcultural difference in pa between han and uyghurmethods using structural magnetic resonance imaging smri and voxelbased morphometry vbm approach we recruited  han chinese and  uyghur chinese individuals a multiple regression model in spm was used for wholebrain level analysis to identify regions in which gray matter gm volume was significantly correlated with pa and then a moderation analysis was performed to assess whether brain anatomy variation affects the strength of the subcultural difference in paresults our results showed that the pa of han was significantly less than that of uyghur and the pa of han was significantly associated with larger regional gray matter volume rgmv in the dacc implicated in dialectical thinking moreover structural variations in the dacc moderated the subcultural difference in pa between han and uyghur and the subcultural difference in pa was evident only among those relatively high in gm volume of daccconclusion our study indicates that the increased rgmv in the dacc might help han chinese with high dialectical thinking regulate pa more and thus reduce the positive emotional experience consistent with previous evidence that increased dialectical thinking promotes subcultural differences in pa our findings suggest that subcultures can also shape the brainkeywords pa pa subcultural difference emotion regulation dialectical thinking voxelbased morphometry vbmintroductionaffect is the result of adapting to the environment seeking advantages and avoiding disadvantages during the evolution positive affect pa is a pleasant state that contains additional experiential content about situational meaning compared with negative affect na related to survival a large number of crosscultural studies have shown that pa related to personal growth and development is more susceptible to culture emotion regulation strategies influence emotional experience and there are different ways to regulate pa across cultures eastern culture is characterized by the connection between individuals and others emphasizing interdependence with others western culture is characterized by individual independence at the same time cognitive style plays an important role in regulating pa in western culture the dominant cognitive style is linear pays attention to the logical classification of things and prefers analytical thinking in eastern culture the dominant cognitive style is grounded in dialectical thinking it is characterized by the middle way and prefers to focus on different aspects of things dialectically for example the tao te ching chapter  described misfortune lurks good luck good fortune lurks misfortune interdependent selfconstrual sc and analytical thinking have led to the hedonic regulation of pa in western culture the westerners pursuit of maximizing positive emotional experiences the belief that pa are related to personal achievements and encourage individuals to pursue more positive emotional experiences on the other hand eastern culture engage in less hedonic emotion regulation and contrahedonic regulation believe that affect is social individual pa can cause envy of others that destroy harmonious social relationships in addition eastern culture treats pa in a dialectical and balanced way and believes that positive emotional experiences are not so important in daily life easterners tend to consider extreme joy begets sorrow and pa was more suppressed because of different emotion regulation strategies easterners experience fewer pa than westernerscultural differences in pa exist not only in eastern and western cultures but also within the same country a recent study found that latino experiences pa more than asians but less than european americans a similar situation exists in china china is a multinationality country and some nationalities have their own subcultural scripts for example the han chinese and uyghur chinese differ in many aspects historically the subsistence pattern of han was sedentary farming and the uyghur was nomadic herding the subsistence pattern affects the individuals cognition of self and the relationship between self and others individuals from farming cultures may have more mutual relationships and connections between themselves and others while individuals belonging to nomadic cultures may be more selfindependence on the other hand language is the carrier and foundation of culture  and an important factor that affects the way of cognition the languages used by the han and uyghur are different chinese characters are mainly ideographic and highly dependent on the context as a typical alphabetic language uyghur is mainly phonetic emphasizing language form and grammar in addition and has more influence on han chinese and han has more dialectical thinking than ethnic minorities including uygher dialectical thinking tends to understand the world in a way of change contradiction and wholeness dialectical thinking emphasizes the control of pa and has the greatest impact on emotional experience than cultural values individualismcollectivism and sc independentinterdependent generally speaking there are differences in selfcognition and thinking styles between han and uyghur in particular han with more dialectical thinking engage in contrahedonic regulation which experiences fewer pa than uyghur  however many of these results were obtained using selfreport questionnaires and behavioral experiments which are still largely unknown about the neural mechanismcognitive neuroscience studies found that dorsal anterior cingulate cortex dacc plays a key role in monitoring and resolving conflict during information processing recent research found that the more dialectical ones thinking style was the more active dacc was during processed selfrelated conflict information dacc plays a critical role in dialectical thinking not only that the dacc is an important brain region for emotional regulation in a recent metaanalysis using coordinatebased activation likelihood estimation of neuroimaging studies dacc was found to be involved in cognitive emotion regulation cognitive reappraisal using cognitive reappraisal strategies when human subjects successfully regulated affect was specifically accompanied by hyperactivation in dacc in addition in the topdown regulation of affect by the cognitive control system dacc implicated in performance monitoring evaluation and feedback may help track the extent to which ones current cognitive reappraisals were changing emotional responses in the conscious level it can be seen that both dialectical thinking and cognitive emotion regulation focus on the monitoring evaluation and change of cognitive information and their influence on affect are similar which may be the main reason for the overlap region in daccwith the development of neuroimaging technology cultural neuroscience has attracted increasing attention from researchers culture influences peoples cognition and behavior through values and norms that constitute daily social realities in which culture continuously interacts with the mind and shapes the neural activities of the brain in which the structure and function are considered plastic cultural variation in psychological processes is traits and it is suitable to use structural magnetic resonance imaging smri to investigate the neural substrates voxelbased morphometry vbm is one such smri that has grown in popularity since its selfintroduction and is widely used in cultural neuroscience researchs for example a recent study using the vbm method examined  chinese young adults and found that independent sc was associated with increased gray matter gm volume in brain regions such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex vmpfc right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dlpfc and right rostrolateral prefrontal cortex rlpfc in another recent study kitayama and colleagues scanned  japanese adults and observed that the more interdependent sc was the smaller the gm volume of individuals in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex ofc interdependent sc was inversely associated with ofc volume therefore the current study attempts to use the vbm to explore the neural basis of subcultural variation in pa between han and uyghur chinese previous behavioral studies have shown that the han chinese had a higher degree of dialectical thinking than the uyghur chinese the han chinese carry out more suppression and control of pa which may be the primary reason for the difference in positive emotional experience between the han and uyghur in addition the behavioral results have shown that the stronger dialectical thinking tendency was associated with fewer positive emotional experiences and it is important that such the contrahedonic regulation of pa exists only in the higher dialectical thinking group we thus hypothesize that the regional gray matter volume rgmv related to dialectical thinking eg the dacc would be correlated with pa which only in han chinese further dialectical thinking has different effects on groups with different degrees of dialectical thinking dialectical thinking affects positive emotional experiences greater among higher dialectical thinking groups than among lower dialectical thinking groups building on this evidence we hypothesize that the subcultural difference in pa between han and uyghur chinese would be more pronounced among the higher rgmv related to dialectical thinking than among lowermethodsparticipantsa fortysix righthanded undergraduate students at the university of southwest in chongqing were paid to participate in this study seventyfive of them  women  men were han chinese the average age was  sd  years with a range of  to  years the remaining   females and  males were uyghur chinese born and raised in xinjiang with an average age of  sd  years with a range of  to  years all participants were healthy and none of the participants had a history of neurological or psychiatric disorders the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of southwest university the participants provided informed consentquestionnaire positive and negative affect schedule panaspositive affect was assessed using the pa subscale of the chinese revised edition of the panas the scale is composed of  items for pa eg enthusiastic excited and  items for negative affect na eg afraid nervous participants rated the extent to which they generally experienced each particular positive and negative emotion on a point scale from very slightly or not at all to extremely the chinese revised edition of the panas has good crosscultural applicability which is also applicable to the chinese and the cronbachs alpha reliability of pa and na was adequate  and  respectively  in this study the alpha coefficients for pa and na were  and  respectively in the han chinese sample and  and  respectively in the uyghur chinese sample since pa is correlated with na the na score was controlled as a covariate in this studymri data acquisitionall mri images were acquired using a tesla siemens trio scanner to acquire highresolution tweighted images a magnetizationprepared rapid gradient echo mprage

to obtain the gm volume of the images the image intensity of each voxel was modulated the modulated images were smoothed with a gaussian kernel of mm full width at half maximum fwhmstatistical analysisthe preprocessed gm images were included in the statistical analyses to test our predictions a multiple regression model in spm was used for wholebrain level analysis to identify regions in which gm volume was significantly correlated with pa scores of han and uygur chinese respectively gm values lower than  were first excluded to avoid edge effects around the border between gm and wm we utilized the nonstationary clusterlevel family wise error fwe correction for multiple comparisons and the corrected threshold for regions of significance was p   at the cluster level followed by p   at the voxel levelmoderation analysis was conducted to confirm whether brain anatomy variation affects the strength of the subcultural difference in positive emotional experience between han and uyghur chinese by using the process macro for spssto exclude the influence of irrelevant variables gender age na score and total brain gm volume were used as covariates to control for the above statistical analysisresultsquestionnaire datain order to verify the difference in pa between han and uyghur chinese the independent sample ttest analysis showed that the pa score of han was  sd and

explore the brain regions associated with pa in han and uyghur chinese we performed a multiple regression analysis after controlling for sex age na score and total brain gm volume whole brain analysis revealed that the total pa score of han was significantly negatively associated with the rgmv in the dacc mni peak coordinates    number of voxels r   p   figure  no significant rgmv associated with

volume plays a moderating role in the subcultural difference in positive emotional experiences between han and uyghurfigure  dorsal anterior cingulate cortex dacc volume moderated the positive emotional experience difference between han and uyghurdiscussionin this vbm study we explored the neural basis of the subcultural differences in pa between han and uyghur chinese as predicted our findings provided evidence that the increased gm volume in the dacc predicted positive emotional experiences in han chinese importantly the difference in pa between han and uyghur chinese was evident only among those relatively high in the gm volume of the dacc these findings were consistent with our hypothesis that increased dialectical thinking as indicated by the increased gm volume of the dacc promoted subcultural differences in paour behavioral results showed that han chinese experienced less pa than uyghur chinese which was consistent with previous results in a study focusing on nonstudent survey objects it was found that han adults had significantly fewer than uyghur adults with positive emotional experience although the research groups in this study were college students who are more influenced by mainstream culture and the differences among the subjects are smaller the results still showed that there were significant differences in pa between han and uyghurwe further found that the pa scores of the han were significantly negatively associated with gm volume in the dacc as a key hub of cognitive emotion regulation the dacc received emotional information from the amygdala on the one hand and emotion regulation instructions from the frontal cortex on the other hand and adjusted the strategy and intensity of emotion regulation through cognitive change in in addition some studies found that the dacc was directly involved in the downregulation of emotions and activated more by reappraisal and distraction emotion regulation strategies deng and colleagues also found that compared with uyghur the attention resource of han was not quickly invested in positive emotional information and the involvement degree was lower moreover recent studies using vbm method have frequently observed the significant positive correlation between the dacc gm volume and the higher level of emotion regulation strategies such as cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression which can weaken emotional experience more importantly wang and colleagues found that the dacc was a key region for dialectical thinking and the relative activation of the dacc during dialectical selfthinking had a significant positive correlation with the more dialectical ones thinking style was dialectical thinking emphasized the controlling of pa and believed that excessive pursuit of positive emotional experience was easy to extreme joy begets sorrow miyamoto and ma found that higher dialectical thinking groups asians suppressed the experience of pa through dialectical beliefs furthermore and dialectical thinking can negatively predict positive emotional experience and dialectical thinking significantly reduces positive emotional experience by activating linear thinking and dialectical thinking respectively therefore the increased rgmv in the dacc might help han chinese with high dialectical thinking regulate pa more through cognitive reappraisal suppression and distraction emotion regulation strategies thus reducing the experience of paimportantly our results indicated that the rgmv of high dacc played a moderating role in the subcultural difference of pa high dacc gm volume is usually linked to greater emotion regulation ability meanwhile high dacc gm volume also represented a high level of dialectical thinking associated with more emotion regulation in this study compared with uyghur han chinese was more influenced by confucianism which has a high degree of dialectical thinking a recent behavioral study found that dialectical thinking was more likely to affect the positive emotional experience in high dialectical thinking group whereas not significant in low dialectical thinking group which effect was more obvious with the improvement of the degree of dialectical thinking in addition after positive events the pa of the higher dialectical thinking group was less improved than those of the lower dialectical thinking group and the change amount of pa in the higher dialectical thinking group was negatively correlated with the belief of dialectical thinking these findings are consistent revealed that dialectical thinking affected the positive emotional experience greater among higher dialectical thinking group than among lower dialectical thinking group therefore with the increase in dacc volume the ability of han to regulate pa is significantly enhanced while the positive emotional experience of han is decreased and the subcultural difference in pa between han and uyghur nationality is more pronouncedlimitationssome limitations of the current study need to be addressed first the participants of our study were college students with a small age span and high education level and there was insufficient ecological validity in crosscultural research and the promotion of the results has certain limitations different age groups are affected differently by culture and society studies have found that uyghur individuals have undergone a change from the relational selfconstrual in adolescent to the collective selfconstrual in adulthood while han individuals have no such change in addition dialectical thinking changes with age older people tend to be more dialectical thinking thus further study should combine longitudinal and crosssectional designs to explore the neural mechanism of the difference in pa between han and uyghur at different ages second this study did not distinguish between acculturation orientation assimilation integration separation or marginalization in uyghur chinese and acculturation orientation influences emotional experience hence further research could examine whether different acculturation can influence the subcultural difference in pa between han and uyghur chinese finally the results of this study may be a combination of environment and genes which have been shown to play an important role in cultural variation of brain structure future investigations should examine these correlations to establish a link between the brain culture and genesconclusionin this study the vbm approach was used to explore the neural basis of the subcultural differences in pa between han and uyghur chinese the results showed that the pa of han was significantly less than that of uyghur and the pa of han was significantly negatively correlated with the volume of gm in the dacc implicated in dialectical thinking processes moreover structural variations in the dacc moderated the difference in pa between han and uyghur the greater the gray matter volume of the dacc the greater the subcultural difference in positive emotional experience between han and uyghur these results indicate that the high degree of dialectical thinking may be the reason why the han regulated pa more and the ability of han to regulate pa is enhanced with the improvement of the degree of dialectical thinking thus the difference in pa between the han and uyghur is more obvious

closely associated with viral structural protein c erns and e as well as nonstructural protein nsa using confocal and immunoprecipitation assays we confirmed the interactions between csfv proteins and copii components and demonstrated that csfv utilizes the copii machinery to acquire the viral envelope from the er taken together our findings highlight the role of copii in csfv morphogenesis and support the hypothesis that flavivirus is infectious upon envelopment at the er and exits the cells via the secretory pathwayclassical swine fever csf is a serious threat to the development of the pig industry further understanding of the lifecycle of csfv will help to eliminate csf in china and many other countries but the mechanism of csfv morphogenesis has not been fully characterized here we focused on the copiimediated early secretory pathway to explore the mechanisms and exact site of csfv particle formation we showed that copii vesicles contain intact infectious virions and that the assembly and envelopment of csfv are closely related to copii components and pathways this work fills an important part of the mapping of the csfv lifecycle which might provide a cellular target for csf therapy and controlintroductionclassical swine fever csf is an acute contagious disease caused by classical swine fever virus csfv csfv belongs to the genus pestivirus within the family flaviviridae which comprises of a large group of enveloped viruses with a singlestranded rna genome of positive polarity other members of the flaviviridae that cause severe disease and mortality in humans and animals include the hepatitis c virus hcv dengue virus denv zika virus zikv west nile virus wnv and bovine viral diarrhea virus bvdv the csfv genome contains a large open reading frame orf encoding a precursor polyprotein which is cleaved into four structural proteins and eight nonstructural proteins by host and viral proteases structural proteins include c erns e and e which assemble with viral genome rna into infectious particles nonstructural proteins include npro p ns ns nsa nsb nsa and nsb which are responsible for viral genome replication and virion morphogenesisit is generally believed that positivesense rna viruses rearrange the cellular endomembrane to form membranous microenvironments for cytoplasmic replication and morphogenesis several flaviviruses can remodel the endoplasmic reticulum er to form viral replication factories and assembly platforms using various strategies for instance infection with denv or zikv induces invagination of rough er membranes toward the er lumen and creates clusters of vesicles called vesicle packets vps viral genome replication occurs in vps and newly synthesized rna genomes assemble with capsids within the er cisternae close to vps in contrast the replication organelles of hcv doublemembrane vesicles dmvs are formed upon er membrane protrusion toward the cytosol the newly synthesized rna was delivered to the assembly site by nonstructural proteins and viral particles budded into the er lumen previous studies have shown that the viral replication complex which contains dsrna and nonstructural proteins is distributed close to the endoplasmic reticulum er however the host organelles and proteins involved in virus morphogenesis and the precise mechanisms of csfv assembly and budding remain poorly characterizedin eukaryotic cells vesicular transport is responsible for communication and exchange of substances between organelles anterograde transport from the er to the golgi apparatus is mediated by coat protein complex ii cop iicoated vesicles formed at er exit sites eres a longlived subdomain of the er the cop ii machinery consists of a small gtpase sar and two heterodimeric subcomplexes secsec and secsec upon activation sar penetrates and curves the er membrane recruiting the secsec dimer to form a flexible inner layer sec is the main copii adaptor that concentrates cargo by recognizing specific sorting signals in cargo the sarsecsec complex enables secsec recruitment to form an outer cage which provides a scaffold for sustaining membrane curvature and inactivates sar to induce copii vesicle fission from the er several viruses hijack copii vesicles for genome replication and virion maturation for instance poliovirus utilizes the copii budding mechanism to form replication complexes in the er in ebola virus infection copii mediates the intracellular transport of viruses through the interaction between vp and secc we previously reported that raba a regulator of copii transportation is associated with the assembly of csfv virions however the role of copii in the csfv lifecycle has not been determinedin this study we attempted to unravel the possible function of the copii system in the lifecycle of csfv by systematically analyzing the relationship between csfv production and copii expression in vivo and in vitro the distribution of viral proteins and particles in copii mutant cells the presence of csfv components in isolated copii vesicles and the interaction between viral and copii proteins demonstrating that csfv hijacks the copii pathway to transport infectious progeny virions emanating from the er our findings provide new insights into the life cycle of csfv and new data to support the conclusion that the replication and assembly of csfv occurs in the erresultscsfv increases the expression of cop protein in vivoto determine the effect of csfv infection on the copiimediated secretory pathway in vivo we characterized the differential expression of copii components in the spleen kidney tonsil and intestine which are the target organs of csfv of control or csfvinfected piglets using immunohistochemistry ihc and immunoblotting ihc showed upregulation of sarb and seca in the spleen tonsil and intestine in the csfvinfected group compared to the control group fig ac similarly immunoblotting assays showed that the expression of sarb sec and sec was increased in the spleen and intestine following csfv infection fig d in the kidney csfv infection did not result in significant changes in sarb expression but enhanced the expression of sec and sec these results indicate that csfv infection promotes the expression of copii components implying an active role for copii in the csfv lifecycleknockdown of cop components suppresses csfv productionto determine whether copii is involved in the life cycle of csfv we examined csfv replication in copiideficient cell lines we first constructed lowexpressing cell lines of sarb sec and sec which are located in the core inner layer and outer layer of cop using an shrnamediated lentivirus system fig a however the viability of the cell lines was not significantly affected compared with the control cells fig b the knockdown efficiency was detected by immunoblotting assay and the results showed that the expression of the target protein in knockdown cell lines was reduced to  of sarb fig c  of sec fig d and  of sec fig e which can be used in subsequent studies we then detected csfv replication in knockdown cell lines realtime pcr results showed that the viral genome copy levels were all reduced significantly both at  and  h postinfection hpi and immunoblotting showed that the viral structural protein e was decreased in knockdown cell lines indicating that the knockdown of copii components suppresses the replication of csfv these data suggested that copii is necessary for csfv infectioncop mediates csfv virions exit erto investigate the stage of the csfv life cycle for which copii is required we analyzed the effects of copii inhibition on csfv replication within the first life cycle of csfv after infection we first used a lentivirus system to construct mutant cell lines of sarb active mutant sarbhg and inactive mutant sarbtn which prevented the formation and transportation of copii vesicles through different mechanisms fig a the cck assay showed that the viability of mutant cell lines was higher than  of that of the control cells fig b which could be used for followup infection assays for the csfv infection test realtime pcr showed that viral genome copy levels were not affected by the sarb mutation within the first lifecycle indicating that copii is not required for viral genome replication fig b immunoblotting assay showed a slight decrease in viral protein expression fig d but the infectivity and titer of progeny viruses decreased significantly in both mutant cell lines fig ef indicating that copii plays a role in producing infectious progeny virions these data suggest that the copii pathway is necessary in the late stages of the csfv life cycle virion assembly budding or releasegiven that copii mediates the classical secretory pathway from the er where several flaviviruses assemble and bud we wondered whether copii is involved in the trafficking of csfv virions we first analyzed the codistribution of csfv e protein with er in sarb mutant cell lines at  hpi a time point before virion release by immunofluorescence as shown in fig g the distribution correlation between e and er was increased from  of control cell lines to  and  of active and negative mutant cell lines respectively in the sarbhg cell line e was gathered into a spot that strongly colocalized with er whereas in the sarbtn cell line e and er were codistributed around the nucleus fig g indicating that cop supports the exportation of e from the er we then observed the distribution of virions in the mutant cell lines by transmission electron microscopy tem at  hpi interestingly for the first time we found that csfv particles gathered in the er and were distributed along the plasma surface of the er in the sarbhg cell line the number of virions aggregated in the er was much greater than that in the control cells moreover several virions in the assembly were found in the expanded er lumen fig h indicating that the exportation of csfv virions from the er was blocked by the copii mutation in the sarbtn cell line rare virions were found on the er surface with only some virions in the enlarged er lumen fig h indicating that virion formation was suppressed by copii mutation these data suggest that the copii pathway supports csfv morphogenesis and mediates csfv virion exit from the ercop vesicles carry csfv particlesto confirm that copii vesicles mediate the exit of csfv virions from the er we characterized copii vesicles in csfvinfected pk cells we first isolated intact copii vesicles from csfvinfected cells by immunoprecipitation with an antiseca antibody that binds specifically to the outer coat of copii vesicles as described in materials and methods fig a isolated copii vesicles were identified using tem and immunoblotting the tem results showed many intact vesicular structures with an average diameter of nearly  nm fig b and immunoblotting showed that the isolated vesicles contained copii components seca sec sec and sarb and copii cargo protein ergic but no calnexin fig c an er marker was detected indicating that immunoprecipitation with the antiseca antibody effectively enriched intact copii vesicles and the isolated vesicles were not contaminated with er impurities we then detected viral components in the isolated vesicles and showed that the isolated vesicles contained viral genome rna fig d and envelop protein e fig cd we further freezethawed the vesicles to release the virus particles harbored in copii vesicles and then incubated them with pk cells for  h to detect the infected plaques of csfv by immunofluorescence with antie antibody as shown in fig e the vesicles formed clear plaques in pk cells indicating that the copii vesicles had csfv infectivity fig e furthermore we performed immunetem to characterize the isolated copii vesicles and showed that the vesicles were positive for the csfv e protein fig f overall these results suggest that the copii vesicles contain intact infectious csfv particles therefore copii vesicles are intracellular transport carriers of csfv virionsproximitydependent biotinylation of cop components and cargoes in pk cellswe found that the formation of csfv virions in the er was suppressed by the sarb inactive mutation fig  to further explore the role of copii in csfv morphogenesis we first established biotin ligasecatalyzed proximity labeling pl which has emerged as a new approach to study protein and subcellular compartments in living cells because of its spatial labeling and nontoxicity to capture the components and cargo of copii vesicles in pl a specific protein is genetically fused with a promiscuous biotin ligase that biotinylates endogenous proteins within a few nanometers when treated with biotin biotinylated endogenous proteins can be identified using conventional biotin capture methods in this study sarb was genetically fused with the e coli biotin ligase bira bioid and its widely used variants bioid and turboid fig a the streptavidin blot assay showed that bioid labeled several proteins whereas bioid and turboid barely labeled the proteins within  h of biotin treatment all three ligases labeled multiple proteins after more than  h of treatment figb but the labeling efficiency of bioid was higher than that of the other two enzymes figc therefore we used bioid for labeling next we performed a streptavidin pulldown pd assay and found that sarbbioid biotinylates sec and seca in a biotin dosedependent manner for easy detection we used  m biotin for  h in sarbbioid mediated biotinylating finally we examined the specificity of sarbbioid mediated pl through streptavidin pd and streptavidin fluorescence it was shown that the five components of copii as well as the cargo protein ergic were biotinylated but little labeling was observed for the control mitochondrial protein tom figef suggesting that sarbbioid could specifically capture the components and cargo of copiimultiple proteins of csfv are the cargoes of cop vesicleto identify the viral structural and nonstructural proteins that are transported through copii vesicles we examined the biotinylation of exogenously expressed viral structural and nonstructural proteins in sarbbioid mediated pl cells streptavidin pd showed that the structural proteins c erns and e as well as the nonstructural protein nsa were biotinylated by sarbbioid figa we then performed streptavidin fluorescence to confirm biotinylation of the identified viral proteins confocal assays showed that these four proteins were all codistributed with sarbbioidbiotinylated proteins indicating that c erns e and nsa were efficiently labeled by sarbbioid figb these results suggested that copii vesicles are closely associated with the transport of viral structural proteins implying that copii is involved in csfv virion formationinteractions between csfv proteins and cop componentsto confirm the role of copii in virion morphogenesis we performed an immunofluorescence confocal assay and immunoprecipitation to detect the interactions between csfv proteins and copii components confocal assay showed that viral envelope proteins erns and e strongly colocalized with seca figa which is a copii outer coat protein and a marker of the copii vesicle budding site eres indicating that csfv may acquire an envelope at the eres moreover e and c have a strong colocalization with seca figa a cargo catcher for copii transportation indicating that the copii vesicle is the place for envelop proteins and capsid meeting a premise for the viral budding process furthermore an immunoprecipitation assay showed that viral capsid protein c bound to seca indicating that the csfv capsid is captured by seca to enter copii vesicles these results suggested that the csfv capsid utilizes the assembly mechanism of copii to acquire the viral envelope from the er in conclusion this study shows that csfv utilizes copii machinery to form progeny virions on the er and hijacks copii vesicles to exit the erdiscussionnumerous enveloped viruses manipulate and usurp the cellular compartments of the secretory pathway to promote genome replication virion assembly and egression this study explored the role of the copii system which mediates anterograde transport from the er to the golgi apparatus in csfv replication and morphogenesis we showed that csfv infection promoted the expression of copii proteins in vivo and knockdown of copii components decreased csfv production in vitro in addition the inhibition of the cop pathway by sarb mutation blocks the exportation of csfv e protein and virions from the er and leads viral protein and particles to aggregate in the er moreover we found that the copii vesicles contained intact infectious csfv particles demonstrating that the copii secretory system is responsible for the exportation of csfv mature virions from the er the copii pathway also supports trafficking of other viruses previous studies have shown that the copii protein sara is involved in hcv secretion and hcv lipoviroparticles have been detected in isolated copii vesicles in addition parvoviruses were engulfed into copiicoated vesicles enroute to the golgi and plasma membrane upon association with the er underlining the general role of the copii pathway in virus intracellular traffickingwe also found that csfv virion assembly occurred in the er and depended on the mechanism of copii formation in sarbhg mutant cells in which sarb was locked in the active state and the assembled copii vesicle could not pinch off from the er an increased number of virions were trapped on the surface of the er in sarbtn mutant cells in which sarb is locked in an inactive state and copii cannot assemble only a few particles which should be naked nucleocapsids due to their smaller size and crystalline arrangement were found in the lumen indicating that the formation of csfv particles was inhibited by copii deficiency the extensive colocalization of copii components with viral structural proteins and the binding of seca with viral capsid proteins indicates that the copii machinery is involved in the assembly of nucleocapsids in addition through proximity labeling identification and confocal assay we showed that the copii pathway is associated with the transport of csfv nsa which is an erlocated viral protein that interacts with the viral capsid protein to promote virion assembly notably nsa can also bind to raba a regulator protein of the copii pathway that is involved in csfv assembly therefore viral nucleocapsids were formed in the er lumen in a copiidependent mannerviruses acquire their envelope at the plasma membrane when they exit the host cell but there is growing evidence indicating that this is not the case for all viruses in positivestrand rna virus envelopment the compartments of the early secretory pathway often supply the donor membrane such as the er of flaviviruses ergic of coronaviruses and golgi of togaviruses in this study the codistribution of seca and seca with viral envelope proteins indicates that the copii machinery supports csfv envelope acquisition at the eres combined with the existence of intact virions in isolated copii vesicles we conclude that the csfv progeny virions assemble in the er and bud into copii vesicles to exit via the secretory pathwaythe morphogenesis in er and copii vesicles allows virions to be transported through the secretory pathway toward the plasma membrane and promotes their final release interestingly dmvs formed by some viruses such as poliovirus and hcv carry autophagy proteins lc and beclin therefore they are also referred to as autophagosomelike vesicles these viruses utilize autophagosomelike vesicles to enhance viral replication and nonlytic egression through the secretory autophagy pathway although we did not find similar structures in csfv and other pestivirusinfected cells the autophagy pathway is necessary for csfv replication and release and more importantly we have previously shown that csfv progeny virions accumulate in autophagosomes before release however the origin of autophagosomes in csfvinfected cells remains poorly understood recent studies have shown that both copii and ergic originate from the membrane of autophagosomes therefore whether the csfv virions in copii vesicles traffic directly to autophagosomes or traffic through the golgi or other compartments to the autophagy pathway is worth exploringin summary this study demonstrated that csfv assembles in the er and buddes into copii vesicles to exit the ermarerials and methodscells and virus porcine kidney pk cells and human embryonic kidney hekt cells were cultured in high glucose dmem

mritrackable multipotent autologous mesenchymal stromal cell product developed for intracerebral transplantation we evaluated the safety and tolerability of the product as well as monitored neurological recovery and the behavior of the transplanted cells in patients in the subacute phase of ischemic strokemethods we performed an openlabel singlesite doseescalation study adults with severe disability national institutes of health stroke scale nihss score   and modified rankin scale score mrs  were transplanted with huns  days after ischemic stroke with a single dose of  or  million cells via perilesional stereotactic transplantation safety monitoring neurological evaluation and radiographic evaluation were performed throughout  year after the transplantation this trial was registered with the umin clinical trial registry number uminfindings seven patients were recruited between april  and august  all of whom fulfilled the criteria successfully achieved cell

to the cell products were observed improvements in nihss and mrs ranged from to  median  and  median  respectively transient hyperintensity around the injection site on tweighted fluidattenuated inversion recovery flair mri was observed between  days and  months after transplantation and cell migration and engraftment to the infarction border especially to the inner surface was found between one and six months after transplantationinterpretation intracerebral transplantation of huns was safe and welltolerated and was associated with improved neurological function flair signals in the early phase and cell migration and engraftment to the ischemic boundaries in the latter phase are considered to be the therapeutic mechanismsfunding japan agency for medical research and development amedintroductionischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death and adult neurological disability worldwide the disease can be chronologically divided into acute  hours subacute   months and chronic phases the only treatments currently approved are intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and intraarterial mechanical thrombectomy in acute phase however nearly  of the patients suffer residual neurological deficits and require daily assistance even after successful revascularization rehabilitation is then applied to gain functional recovery after subacute phase of the disease however the effects decrease over time and the recovery reaches plateau several weeks to months after stroke due to limited endogenous recovery capacity of the braincell therapy is a promising strategy to enhance functional recovery in patients with ischemic stroke and studies in animal models have identified multiple effects on recovery including cell differentiation immunomodulation antiinflammation and stimulation of endogenous repair processes angiogenesis and neurogenesis although a variety of cell types have been explored as candidate donor cells autologous mesenchymal stromal cells mscs possess great potential as cell sources that are easily obtainable and expandable and can be used with no ethical issues or unwarranted immunoreactionrejection our group has continuously reported preclinical animal studies using mscs for subacute and chronic models of ischemic stroke several important clues are found through these studies that are applied in this trial for better clinical results which are mscs can be sufficiently expanded by human platelet lysate pl compensable to animal blood origin products intracerebral transplantation is superior to the intravenous approach in functional recovery for the subacute and chronic phases and  superparamagnetic iron oxide spio cell labeling enabled cell tracking by magnetic resonance mr imaginghere we

and second screening was set one week prior to the transplantation approximately  months from the ischemic stroke whether patients modified rankin scale mrs are more than  this would allow only patients with unrecovered severe motor deficits to be included in this study the main exclusion criteria were prior disabling stroke severe hemorrhagic transformation from ischemic stroke and severe

stools were observed edema was found in the colon on computed tomography leading to the diagnosis of ischemic enterocolitis although the patient had already restarted his antiplatelet drug soon after the surgery he was suffering from severe diabetes mellitus and arterial atherosclerosis and postsurgical invasiveness may have provoked the disease fasting with intravenous fluid hydration quickly resolved the symptoms and the patient started to take oral food in a few days this is reported to be a sae possibly related to surgical procedures including the absence of antiplatelet drugsadverse events aes that were seen more than   of the patients are listed in the table  the highest ae was headache which all patients  experienced during the study period due to the surgical procedure however worst ctcae grade of headache was reported to be  which was mild or moderate in severity other aes were not related to cell products or surgical procedures there were no cases of parenchymal or subdural hematoma in this series which is a major concern of intracerebral transplantationefficacy evaluationneurological and functional scores showed consistent recovery throughout the study period fig  although the patients showed preoperative neurological improvement which can be considered as natural recovery of the disease some of the scores nihss and bi showed significant acceleration of daily incremental recovery in the early postoperative period up to one month after transplantation furthermore the bi and fim scores which indicate the quality of daily activities showed significant improvement between  and  months these data indicate that huns can achieve both early and late recoveriesradiographical evaluationqualitative brain imaging showed a temporary hyperintensity signal around the cells on tweighted flair mri in all patients the signals were found as early as  days after transplantation peaked at approximately  days and mostly diminished at  months after transplantationcell migration and engraftment were also observed in all patients which was monitored by the movement of spiolabeled cells through t mri fig  and supplementary fig  the t signal can be found at the transplanted site immediately after surgery and the signal decreases as time advances the signals were then found at the infarction border as early as one month after transplantation and were clearly seen at  months interestingly these t signals were mostly observed at the inner border of the infarction periinfarct area near the subventricular zone once the signals appeared at the site they persisted throughout the study period indicating that the transplanted cells migrated and engrafted in the periinfarction areadiscussion this firstinhuman trial of intracerebral transplantation of mritrackable mscs against the subacute phase of ischemic stroke offers preliminary data on feasibility tolerability and cellrelated safety we were able to find several new aspects the cell from the patient itself could be expanded to sufficient amounts using allogeneic platelet lysate there were no serious adverse events related to the cell product functional recovery was found in bimodal fashion with early and late stage flair high signal presumably representing release of trophic factors was observed in the early period and cell migration and engraftment to the ischemic

potential risk of prion viral or zoonoses contamination which may require a long duration  years of followup due to its window period in this study we applied allogeneic human platelet lysate which is obtained from three different healthy donor containing    ngml plateletderived growth factor pdgf and the fact that decimation was required for five of seven patients highlighting the high potential of pl however we encountered one patient who did not reach the preplanned cell number    pdgf in the pl used for this patients medium was within the normal range  ngml and we considered that patient factors may be responsible for this unexpected event although the number of mononuclear cells  x  was mostly similar to that in other patients this patient developed severe deep venous thrombosis before the bone marrow harvest in the femoral vein due to hemiparesis and compression of the puncture site after thrombectomy mscs are reported to have the capacity to enter the blood stream from the bone marrow to migrate to the inflammation site and we assume that mscs in this patient may be moved to the inflammation process taking place at the femoral vein resulting in less mscs in the bone marrowsafetyin this trial there were no hemorrhagic complications related to cell transplantation procedures or cellrelated adverse events we paid extreme caution to prevent hemorrhagic complications during surgical manipulation the effort includes adequate cessation of antithrombotic drugs with sufficient hydration before surgery or the use of a reversal agent for direct oral anticoagulants which is performed just before transplantation previous reports of intracerebral cell transplantation for ischemic stroke showed no or very low incidence of hemorrhagic complication  our recent report of intracerebral stem cell transplantation for traumatic brain injury reported  of patients with parenchymal or subdural hematoma which  of them reported headache there was no lifethreatening hemorrhage requiring removal of the hemorrhage and every effort should be made to minimize surgical complications to ensure high efficiency in stem cell therapymotor recoveryfunctional recoveries were continuously observed for up to one year in our patients these data uniquely showed the twostage effect of recovery which first accelerated the early recovery presumably through the trophic factor effect and second enabling motor recovery in the late phase by cell engraftment and differentiation one of the key factors in this trial was the use of autologous cells which avoids immune rejection of the transplanted cells the movement and engraftment of the labelled cells indicate the superiority of autologous cells over allogeneic cells however the natural course of improvement through rehabilitation must not be underestimated in this phase and the patient inclusion criteria differ between trials six articles examined stem cell therapy for the subacute phase of ischemic stroke and most of them could not achieve statistical difference between the cell therapy and control groups these data suggest that even though recovery was achieved it may be accomplished through natural recovery by rehabilitation we noticed that the heterogeneity of recovery between patients and appropriate selection of the control group will be necessary to fully prove the effectiveness of cell therapymritransient highintensity flair signal at the site of transplantation shortly after transplantation was seen in all patients in which the peak of the signal was seen around days  to  and resolved by  to  months transient flair high signal has been previously reported by other groups and the size of the flair high signal correlated with functional recovery the data presented here are in line with our findings that the site of flair high was negative for diffusionweighted image which means that it is not cytotoxic edema or acute ischemic stroke we experienced acceleration of speech deficit aphasia recovery in one of the patients during the first two weeks of transplantation and showed a strong flair signal we assumed that trophic factors released from transplanted cells such as vascular endothelial growth factor vegf are related to this phenomenon vegf is known for its vasculogenesis capacity and can open the bloodbrain barrier bbb allowing intravascular water to pass through the bbb and create transient edema a cell that can produce a certain amount of vegf can also produce other trophic factors useful for recovery and this phenomenon can be a potential biomarker for the recovery of cell therapywe also observed cell migration and engraftment as seen by t mr imaging while the t signal representation of transplanted cells diminished over time at the transplanted site a de novo t signal appeared around the periinfarction border one to  months after the transplantation and the signal remained at the site for at least one year we have previously reported that tlabelled cells can migrate to the ischemic boundary zone in an animal model and migration is controlled by cxcr on the cell surface recognizing stromal cellderived factor from the damaged neurons to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of the mobility of transplanted cells in the human brain in which the cells are gathered to the inner border of the infarction however there is a possibility that the signal can be from other patientderived cells such as microglia and macrophages obtaining spio by phagocytosing transplanted cells and reaching the ischemic boundary zone for debris clearinglimitationthis study has several limitations the small sample size limited the number of patients exposed to each dose level and was inadequate to draw any conclusions regarding the efficacy of the stem cell product and a low incidence of adverse events may be masked safety assessments were only performed for up to one year subsequent followup is currently ongoing and we have not encountered any adverse events related to the cell products although a longer safety followup is necessary the openlabel design and lack of a control group mean that these exploratory efficacy data should be considered with extreme caution it is understandable that any neurological change over time might result from the natural recovery of the diseaseconclusionfirstinhuman trial using labeled

Macroscopic failure characteristic 5 Conclusion,experimental investigation on strength deformation and failure characteristics of hollow cylindrical sandstone under axial torsional testabstract based on the characteristics of the changes in the stress magnitude and orientation of the surrounding rock caused by the excavation of a deeply buried tunnel a series of axial torsional tests on four sandstones considering the rotation of the stress principal axis were carried out using a selfdeveloped hollow cylinder torsional apparatus the general experimental results are obtained first by analyzing the strength and deformation curves it is found that the peak shear strength of rock is nonlinear and positively correlated with axial stress and negatively correlated with the rotation angle of the stress principal axis and the stressstrain curve has the characteristics of compaction elasticity yield and hardening then the influence of the rotation of the principal stress axis on the rock strength and deformation characteristics under different initial stress states was analyzed the results show that the rotation of the stress principal axis can aggravate the damage of the rock and the greater the initial damage degree the stronger the effect will be and conversely the weaker it will be finally the applicability of the crack propagation model considering stress principal axis rotation was verified from an experimental point of view by analyzing the rock failure characteristics and the evolution mechanism of the internal rock cracks under the axialtorsional test was discussed introductionwith the rapid development of the social economy in recent years peoples demand for the development and utilization of underground space has never been strong a large number of deep rock mass projects have emerged in many fields such as the exploitation of mineral resources the construction of largescale underground caverns for hydropower projects the development of oil and gas the deep buried disposal of nuclear waste and the utilization of geothermal energy the ensuing complex geological environment and special construction techniques have led to a series of new scientific phenomena in the deformation and destruction of surrounding rocks therefore it is necessary to explore the mechanical properties of rocks in complex environmentssandstone one of the most common geological rock bodies in deep buried underground engineering has been studied by many scholars and has obtained rich research results first the basic mechanical properties of sandstone were fully studied based on conventional rock mechanics tests with the improvement of test technology the stress state that can be achieved by test equipment becomes increasingly complicated and scholars have a better understanding of the mechanical properties of sandstone zhu jiebing et al conducted triaxial unloading rheological experiments and rheological model studies based on the green sandstone of the diversion tunnel of the jinping ii hydropower station studied the effects of different confining pressures stress states and unloading on the deformation characteristics and parameters of sandstone by conducting triaxial cyclic loading and unloading tests zhang junwen et al used a multifunctional true triaxial fluidsolid coupling system to perform true triaxial tests on sandstone under different stress paths and simulation depths and obtained the evolution characteristics of the progressive failure mechanical behavior of sandstone under true triaxial conditions huang da et al carried out a direct shear test in which the normal stress was gradually unloaded while the shear stress was kept constant and revealed the mechanical mechanism of rock mass shear failure induced by excavation unloading with the development of research the dynamic characteristics of sandstone are gradually being considered x b li et al conducted an experimental study on the impact of the same dynamic load under different axial compressions and the critical impact failure of rocks under different axial compressions gong fengqiang et al used the hopkinson pressure bar combined with a dynamic and static loading device to conduct a onedimensional experimental study on the dynamic characteristics of sandstone under combined dynamic and static loading in recent years with the emergence of nuclear waste disposal geothermal development oil and gas exploitation and other projects many scholars have focused on the mechanical behavior and seepage characteristics of sandstone under multifield coupling temperature chemistry stress and seepagein recent years many researchers have found that the stress state of the surrounding rock in deep engineering often suffers from the rotation of the principal stress axis under the influence of excavation disturbance which means that the mechanical properties of the surrounding rock are affected by both the magnitude and orientation of the stress although scholars have obtained rich results in the study of sandstone their focus is on the impact of stress or external environmental changes on the mechanical behavior of sandstone ignoring the effect of stress orientation accurately describing the strength deformation and failure of rock masses is the theoretical basis for engineering safety and stability evaluation therefore an analysis of the mechanical behavior of sandstone under changes in the direction of stress is necessary based on the selfdeveloped rock hollow cylindrical torsion shear test system  axialtorsional tests were carried out on four types of sandstones and analyzed from the aspects of strength deformation and failure characteristics first the strength and deformation characteristics of sandstone under the rotation of the principal stress axis were obtained by analyzing the relationship between the axial stressshear stress and stressstrain then the influence of the initial stress state was explored based on the strength and deformation behavior of the rock under different axial stress levels finally the macroscopic failure characteristics of the rock and the microscopic crack propagation law were analyzed to explore the mechanism of rock crack evolution under the rotation of the principal stress axis experiment methods specimento compare and study the mechanical characteristics of different types of sandstone under combined axial and torsion loads red sandstone white sandstone lime sandstone fine particles and lime sandstone coarse particles were used to conduct related experiments all four types of rocks were from sichuan province china with uniform texture and no obvious defects as shown in fig the hollow cylinder specimens with an outer diameter of  mm inner diameter of  mm and length of approximately  mm were cored from the same block of the material using the doubledrill coring system which can drill the outer and inner bore simultaneously according to the xray diffraction xrd test results the main minerals in sandstone are quartz albite microcline kaolinite calcite and illite as illustrated in table  at the same time in order to better analyze the influence of principal stress orientation on rock mechanical properties conventional rock mechanics tests were carried out on all four sandstones to obtain their basic mechanical parameters detailed information is provided in tables  and  testing scheme and procedurethe axial torsional test realizes the continuous rotation of the stress axis by changing the axial and shear stresses based on this feature a selfdeveloped hollow cylinder torsional apparatus was used to conduct a series of tests this paper  has a specific introduction to the test equipment the specific test loading path is shown in figure  the process oa means that after the axial stress is loaded to a predetermined value the constant pressure control is maintained and then the torsion force ab is applied at an oil discharge rate of  mlmin until the sample is damaged b in this test the corresponding axial stress application level was determined according to the uniaxial compressive strength of the different types of sandstone table  to obtain more reliable test results for different rock types three sets of parallel tests were performed for each test condition and the average results were selected for data analysis characteristics of rock strength and deformationas is well known our understanding of rock mechanical properties begins with strength and deformation this section mainly conducts research from two aspects of rock strength relationship curves and deformation relationship curves to study the influence of stress orientation on rock mechanical properties peak strengthin order to analyze the strength change characteristics of various types of sandstone under axialtorsional test conditions visually and comprehensively the characteristics of the deviated plane axial stress vs shear stress and the principal stress plane average stress generalized shear stress and stress spindle rotation angle were targetedobserving the axial stress vs shear stress curve in table  it can be observed that the peak strengths of the four sandstones increase nonlinearly with the increase in the axial stress and the increment amplitude is gradually reduced among them lime sandstone fine particles was slightly different from the other three sandstones when the axial stress is small a small increase in the axial stress causes the rock shear strength to increase rapidly as the axial stress increased the growth slope rapidly decreased under the condition of a larger axial stress the shear strength of the obtained lime sandstone fine particles is relatively discrete this change feature is basically the same as that of the conventional rock mechanics test confirming the reliability of the basic principle of the axial torsional testin the principal stress plane the average stress and generalized shear stress show a nearly linear positive correlation whereas the rotation angle of the principal stress axis decreases with increasing average stress which is approximately a quadratic parabola function this law was consistently reflected in the four sandstonesto further analyze the relationship between the rotation angle of the principal stress axis and the average stress it can be divided into two stages according to the slope change trend between them table table  in stage i the rotation angle of the principal stress axis of each sandstone decreases rapidly with an increase in the average stress and until stage ii the change in the stress principal axis rotation angle with the average stress is very small and gradually tends to a certain valuethe critical axial stress values of each sandstone were as follows red sandstone mpa white sandstone mpa lime sandstone coarse grain mpa and lime sandstone fine grain mpa combining the uniaxial compressive strength of each sandstone red sandstone mpa white sandstone mpa lime sandstone coarse grain mpa and lime sandstone fine grain mpa it was found that the critical stress value of each rock increased approximately with the increase in its uniaxial compressive strength lime sandstone fine particleslime sandstone coarse particleswhite sandstonered sandstone which means that the critical stress value is closely related to the properties of rock materials and the mechanism will be discussed in detail below stressstrain relationshipto comprehensively study the deformation characteristics of the rock based on the experimental principle and combined with the strength analysis method the shear stressshear strain coordinate system and the generalized shear stressgeneralized shear strain coordinate system are selected to analyze the change law of the deformation curve the test data of different axial stress levels white sandstone  mpa  mpa  mpa  mpa lime sandstone fine grain  mpa  mpa  mpa  mpa and lime sandstone coarse grain  mpa  mpa  mpa  mpa are plotted in the shear stressshear strain coordinate system and the generalized shear stressgeneralized shear strain coordinate system table  to analyze the deformation characteristics of each sandstonein the coordinate system of shear stress  shear strain the shear strain increases with the increase in shear stress when the shear stress reaches a certain value it exhibits an obvious strain hardening phenomenon especially in the critical failure of rock with the increase in axial stress the shear strain of red sandstone and gray sandstone coarse grain is relatively small and the white sandstone even decreases while the gray sandstone fine particles shows a trend of decreasing first and then increasing the analysis was based on the characteristics of each sandstone compared with the other three types of rocks the uniaxial compressive strength and brittleness of gray sandstone fine grain are higher and they show obvious brittleness under the smaller axial stress while the ductility characteristics show slowly under the larger axial stressconsidering that the rock is simultaneously subjected to axial stress and shear stress under the conditions of the axialtorsional test the corresponding axial strain hoop radial and shear strain are generated to reflect the comprehensive deformation characteristics of the rock the generalized shear stressgeneralized shear strain curve is selected for perform analysis taking lime sandstone coarse grains as an example similar to the conventional uniaxial compression stressstrain curve the stressstrain curve of the rock under axialtorsional test conditions can also be divided into four stages the initial compaction stage elastic stage yielding stage and strain hardening stage by analyzing the corresponding strain drop change trend of the rock under different axial stress failures it was found that as the axial stress increased the failure of lime sandstone coarse grains changed from brittleness to ductilityin contrast to the variation characteristics of shear stress shear strain the generalized shear strain of each sandstone increased significantly with the increase in axial stress this is because the generalized shear strain is a comprehensive concept and the rock undergoes greater deformation in the axial radial and circumferential directions under a larger axial stress in summary the author believes that the generalized shear stressgeneralized shear strain should be selected for the analysis of the rock stressstrain relationship under axialtorsional test conditions discussionthe existing research results show that the initial stress state of rock has an important impact on its deformation and failure this study explores the influence of principal stress rotation on rock mechanical behavior under different initial stress states by applying different axial stresses and the axial compression ratio was selected for quantitative analysis the axial compression ratio is the ratio of axial stress to uniaxial compressive strength it not only reflects the damage degree of the rock at different axial stress levels but can also characterize the initial stress state of the rock in addition it can normalize the test results of the four sandstones which is conducive to obtaining universal laws therefore this section will analyze the relationship between the axial compression ratio of each sandstone and the shear stress the generalized shear stress and the rotation angle of the principal stress axis as shown in figure in figure ab when the axial compression ratio of red sandstone is n the shear stress mpa and the generalized shear stress qmpa when the axial compression ratio of red sandstone is n shear stress mpa and generalized shear stress qmpa the growth rate of the shear stress was  and the growth rate of the generalized shear stress was  when the axial compression ratio of white sandstone n the shear stress mpa the generalized shear stress qmpa when the axial compression ratio n the shear stress mpa the generalized shear stress qmpa the growth rate of the shear stress was  and the growth rate of the generalized shear stress was  when the axial compression ratio of lime sandstone coarse grain n the shear stress mpa the generalized shear stress qmpa when the axial compression ratio n the shear stress mpa the generalized shear stress qmpa the growth rate of the shear stress was  and the growth rate of the generalized shear stress was  when the axial compression ratio of lime sandstone fine grain n the shear stress mpa the generalized shear stress qmpa when the axial compression ratio n the shear stress mpa the generalized shear stress qmpa the growth rate of the shear stress was  and the growth rate of the generalized shear stress was  it was found that the shear stress and generalized shear stress of sandstone under the axialtorsional test condition both increase with an increase in the axial compression ratio and the higher the rock strength the greater the increase this law is similar to the confining pressure effect in conventional triaxial tests the larger the initial stress of the rock the stronger the bearing capacity that is the highstress environment improves the bearing capacity of the rock to a certain extentcompared with the conventional rock mechanics test the axialtorsional test realizes the continuous rotation of the principal stress spindle and it is necessary to explore the change law between the stress spindle rotation angle and the axial compression ratio figure c shows the relationship between the axial compression ratio of each sandstone and the rotation angle of the principal stress axis it was found that  the principal stress axis rotation angle corresponding to each sandstone decreases nonlinearly with the increase in the axial compression ratio and the decreasing trend gradually slows down eventually tending to the same value of   under the same axial compression ratio the higher the strength of the sandstone the larger the corresponding principal stress axis rotation angle when it fails this feature is particularly significant at lower axial compression ratios what is the profound significance of the acquisition of these laws how does this help us understand the influence of the initial stress state on the mechanical properties of the rock under the rotation of the principal stress axis the author believes that it can be combined with section  to conduct a comprehensive analysis from an energy point of viewas mentioned above the average stress of each sandstone in the principal stress plane is related to the rotation angle of the stress axis and there is a critical average stress value that divides the curve into two stages the critical average stress value of each sandstone obtained in section  can be converted into the critical axial compression ratio by using formula  as shown in table it is calculated that the critical axial compression ratio of each sandstone is basically between  specifically when n is less than  the rotation angle of the principal stress axis decreases significantly with an increase in the axial stress when n is greater than  the angle does not change significantly these results are consistent with the results obtained above this shows that it is feasible to characterize sandstone with a critical axial compression ratio many scholars have found that the cracking strength of rock is generally  c  and the critical axial compression ratio is beyond this range which means that a certain degree of damage has occurred in the rock it can be seen that the corresponding principal stress axis rotation angle when sandstone fails under the axialtorsional test is closely related to the initial stress state of the rockbefore conducting the analysis we need to understand two basic consensuses  the loading process of the rock satisfies the law of conservation of energy that is the axial stress applied by the loading device to the specimen is a process of continuous work and this part of the energy is stored in the specimen in the form of elastic energy  the propagation direction of the microcracks in the rock is closely related to the orientation of the principal stressbased on the above consensus we know that when the applied axial stress level is low that is when the energy stored in the rock is small the primary microcracks inside the rock are compacted the density of the microcracks is greatly reduced and the ability to resist deformation is enhanced at this time the stress at a larger change in direction can cause the microcracks to penetrate and eventually lead to the destruction of the rock as the internal energy of the rock increases until it exceeds the cracking strength of the rock microcracks of different lengths and directions within the rock rapidly sprout and expand and the internal damage of the sample is intensified and the ability to resist deformation is gradually lost at this time a small rotation angle of the stress axis can aggravate the interpenetration of microcracks and cause damage to the specimen it can be seen that regardless of the initial damage degree of the rock the rotation of the principal stress axis aggravates the deformation and failure of the rock however the initial damage degree affects the strength of the stress spindle rotation aggravating effect the greater the initial damage degree the stronger the aggravating effect and vice versabased on the above analysis the author believes that the critical axial compression ratio can be used to determine the strength of the stress principal axis rotation aggravating effect when the axial compression ratio of the rock exceeds the critical value a small rotation of the principal stress axis will cause larger deformation and severe damage to the rock at this time it is necessary to strengthen the monitoring of the change in the rock stress direction and take timely measures to maintain rock stability the discovery of the abovementioned laws has improved our understanding of rock mechanics properties and provided more important theoretical support for the safe and effective construction of rock engineering characteristics of rock failurethe failure of the rock during loading is the macroscopic expression of its internal force this section will analyze the influence of the stress axis rotation on the characteristics of failure limited by the length of the paper this section analyzes several failure samples under typical axial stress for each type of sandstone as shown in table  the red dotted line in the sample failure diagram indicates the fracture surface of the sample the rupture angle in the rupture angle principal stress axis rotation angle curve refers to the angle between the fracture surface and the vertical direction and the principal stress axis rotation angle is the angle between the maximum principal stress and the vertical direction when the rock fails macroscopic failure characteristicas can be seen from table  the failure mode of red sandstone and white sandstone under low axial stress is an oblique shear crack through the upper and lower ends of the specimen when the axial stress is higher the failure mode is transformed into an oblique shear main crack accompanied by several secondary tensile cracksthe failure modes of lime sandstone coarse grains with axial stress were similar to those of red sandstone and white sandstone the difference is that the failure under a higher axial stress is more severeunlike the three sandstones the shear failure of lime sandstone fine particles under low axial stress only occurred in the middle area of the sample as the axial stress increased the failure area gradually expanded to both ends of the specimen and generated several tensile cracks and the degree of damage gradually increased and even the phenomenon of rock ejection appeared the reason for the analysis is that lime sandstone fine particles has high and obvious brittleness especially under higher axial stress which releases large amounts of energy at the moment of failure resulting in severe damagein summary with the increase in axial stress under the axialtorsional test the failure modes of the four sandstones gradually changed from shear failure to tensileshear failure and the damage degree became more severe mechanism of fracture evolutionas early as  eberhardt performed a threedimensional numerical simulation of tunnel excavation and found that the rotation angle of the principal stress axis controls the direction of crack propagation and proposed a crack propagation model considering the rotation of the principal stress axis although scholars have been discussing the relationship between principal stress axis rotation and rock mechanics based on the model for two decades little research has been conducted on the verification of rock mechanics in this study based on the relationship between the fracture angle of sandstone and the rotation angle of the principal stress axis under the axialtorsional test the evolution mechanism of the internal fractures in the rock is explored as shown in table according to table  the fracture angles of the four sandstones under different axial stresses have a certain correlation with the rotation angle of the principal stress axis but the specific changes are slightly different with the increase of axial stress the fracture angle of red sandstone and white sandstone gradually changes from the rotation angle of the principal stress axis to greater than the rotation angletaking white sandstone as an example when the axial stress is lower than mpa the fracture angle is approximately the same as the rotation angle when the axial stress is higher than mpa the fracture angle is larger than rotation anglecoincidentally this critical value is consistent with what has been obtained in section  and  based on the above analysis it can be seen that when the axial stress is lower than mpa the cracks in the rock are in a stable state at this time the damage of the rock is dominated by the rotation of the principal stress axis so the fracture angle of the specimen is consistent with the rotation angle when the axial stress was higher than mpa the internal cracks of the rock were unstable its expansion depth and density change significantly under the rotation of the principal stress axis the rock fails at a small rotation angle and finally the fracture angle is larger than the rotation angle at this stage the rotation of the principal stress axis accelerated the crack propagation of the rock and intensified the failure process of the rockwith the increase in axial stress the fracture angle of lime sandstone coarse grains gradually changes from the rotation angle of the principal stress axis to less than the rotation anglethis feature can be explained as follows lime sandstone coarse grains is more brittle than white sandstone when the applied axial stress is close to the uniaxial compressive strength of the rock significant damage occurs inside the rock and there are many vertical tensile cracks considering that crack growth is not simply selected in its extending direction the optimal direction is selected based on the interaction of adjacent microcracks based on this understanding the rotation of the principal stress mainly plays a role in aggravating the penetration between cracks and has little influence on the direction of crack propagation finally it shows a tensileshear failure modethe fracture angle of lime sandstone fine grains gradually changes from significantly greater than the rotation angle to slightly less than the rotation angle with an increase in the axial stressthe change trend is slightly different from that of red sandstone white sandstone and lime sandstone coarse grains the author speculated that this phenomenon was mainly related to the internal composition of the rockas shown in figure  the internal pores of the coarsegrained structure are large and few and the internal pores of the finegrained structure are small and manyfrom the perspective of energy crack propagation in rock is a process of energy dissipation and the crack always propagates along the path with less energy dissipation which generally occurs at the boundary between particles and cementin the coarsegrained structure owing to the large particle size and more cementitious materials filled between particles the crack propagation path is relatively short this means that under a lower axial stress the corresponding fracture angle of the rock failure is almost consistent with the rotation angle of the principal stress axisfor the finegrained structure owing to the large specific surface area between the particles the crack propagation path is relatively long and the entire process dissipates more energy finally the fracture angle is greater than the rotation angle the compactness and strength of white sandstone red sandstone lime sandstone coarse grain and lime sandstone fine grain increase in turn under a lower axial stress the relationship between the corresponding fracture angle and the rotation angle gradually changes from almost consistent to a fracture angle greater than the rotation angle in summary the internal composition of the four sandstones is different which makes the relationship between the fracture angle and the rotation angle slightly different but the change law between them reflects the same fracture propagation mode under the rotation of the principal stress axisthat is the propagation direction of the crack tip was parallel to the principal stress orientation and deflected with the rotation of the principal stress axis expanded and even penetrated each other and finally led to rock failure it should be noted that the final failure mode of rock is caused by the joint action of the internal composition and structure of the rock distribution of primary fractures rotation angle of the principal stress axis and other factorstherefore the rock failure law obtained in this study not only confirms the crack propagation model considering the rotation of the principal stress axis proposed by predecessors but also further refines the relationship between the model and rock stress state which provides a reliable basis for popularization and application conclusionthe strength deformation and failure characteristics of sandstone under the continuous rotation of the principal stress axis were studied through an axialtorsional test of four types of sandstone based on the test results the following conclusions were obtained by analyzing the relationship between the axial stressshear stress and mean stressrotation angle the variation law of sandstone strength is obtained the results show that the peak shear strength of different sandstones under the axialtorsional test has a nonlinear positive correlation with the axial stress and a negative correlation with the rotation angle of the principal stress axis the deformation characteristics of sandstone were analyzed by analyzing the relationships between shear stress and shear strain and generalized shear stressgeneralized shear strain the results show that similar to the conventional rock mechanics test the stressstrain relationship of sandstone can be divided into the initial compaction stage elastic stage yield stage and strain hardening stage the difference is that the axial torsional test focuses on the relationship between the generalized shear stress and generalized shear strain by applying different axial stresses the influence of principal stress axis rotation on rock mechanical behavior under different initial stress states was explored it was found that the rotation of the principal stress axis can aggravate the deformation and failure of the rock and the initial stress state affects the strength of the effect and the critical axial compression ratio is proposed as the criterion specifically when the axial compression ratio of the rock is greater than the critical value that is when the initial damage degree is large the rotation of the principal stress axis at a small angle will cause the rock to be violently damaged at this time certain measures such as surrounding rock support avoidance disturbance etc reduce its destructiveness exploring the evolution mechanism of rock fractures under the rotation of the principal stress axis based on rock failure characteristics the results showed that the rotation of the principal stress axis affected the expansion direction of the internal cracks in the rock which intensified the expansion and penetration of the cracks to a certain extent the applicability of the considering stress principal axis rotation crack propagation model is confirmed and it is believed that the final rock failure shape is not only affected by the principal stress axis rotation but also the internal composition structure of the rock and the distribution of primary fractures are also important influencing factors

acid as both a catalyst and a solvent tctctf in conventional methods metal ions remain and large quantities cannot be synthesized our new method solved these problems and achieved a higher quality tctctf tctctf had a layered structure and a composition with a cn ratio of  which is close to the ideal valuekeywords covalent triazine framework tricyanotriazine liquidphase synthesisnitrogencontaining carbon materials such as graphitic carbon nitride gcn and ndoped graphene have been extensively studied as catalyst supports sensors semiconductors electrode materials photocatalysts and reaction catalysts in order to fully exhibit the properties of nitrogencontaining carbon materials synthesis of controlled structures is essential the covalent triazine framework ctf is a structurally controlled nitrogencontaining carbon material among them ctf synthesized from tricyanotriazine tct is one of the most nitrogencontaining carbon materials n atom content is at similarly to other nitrogencontaining carbon materials ctf synthesized from tct tctctf has been studied as a catalyst and a gas adsorbent with a large specific surface area in general tctctf is synthesized by heating tct and zinc chloride at high temperatures in a sealed tube however in such a method zncl remains in the product and adversely affects its physical properties in these studies ctf synthesized from dicyanobenzene does not have a nitrogen atom in the vicinity and zinc ions can be relatively easily removed because of its low coordination force with respect to zinc ions whereas tctctf has a nitrogen atom with coordination force in the vicinity such as phenanthroline and it is easy to coordinate zinc ions causing difficulty in removing the ions because chelate structures such as phenanthroline are used as ligands residual metallic components as impurities have adverse effects on their use in such applications therefore it is necessary to synthesize tctcfts without the use of metal ions in previous methods mass synthesis could not be attained because of the closed conditions thus tctctf can be synthesized under open conditions without metal ionsin the field of organic synthesis triazine cyclization of cyanocompounds has been studied under various synthetic conditions in particular the cyclization reaction of low molecular weight compounds has been extensively synthesized at low temperatures using trifluoromethanesulfonic acid tfoh as a catalyst in organic solvents the polymerization reaction of cyanocompounds such as tctctf is probably carried out under such conditions however in practice at such a low temperature the reactivity is low therefore it is difficult to obtain highmolecularweight compounds such as tctctf as a solution to this problem it is conceivable that the reactivity is improved by raising the temperature but the organic solvent is decomposed under hightemperature conditions when a superacid such as tfoh is usedpreviously attempts have been made to synthesize ctf using tct and tfoh but the reaction conditions were too mild to achieve metalfree synthesis of tctctf and ultimately zncl was used in another method dicyanobenzene was cyclized for ctf by using chcltfoh at  k this procedure can synthesize a thin film of ctf by reacting at the twoliquid interface without metal ions but the reaction temperature is much higher than the boiling point of chcl which results in intense boiling therefore using this method largescale synthesis for industrial manufacturing is difficult in addition as described above when dicyanobenzene is used as the raw material the metal ions can be removed by the purification step thus the synthesis method using no metal ions is not importantfigure   reaction scheme of tctctf from tct using tfohin this study metalfree tctctf was synthesized from tct in a liquidphase reaction under open conditions using only strong acids without metal compounds and organic solvents in general organic solvents the produced tctctf has low solubility and precipitates form during the reaction and the reaction stops whereas tctctf shows high solubility in hot tfoh and the dissolved state is maintained until the end of the reaction heated tfoh was suitable for the synthesis of tctctf in terms of solubility and reactivitythe raw material tct purchased from synchem inc and the catalyst tfoh purchased from fujifilm wako pure chemical corp was used as received without further purification the tct  mg was dissolved in  g of tfoh and heated under reflux conditions for  h in a nitrogen atmosphere figure  after the reaction excess water was poured into the reaction mixture and the mixture was filtered the residue was washed with sonication with water and  aqueous nh and dried under vacuum finally  mg of tctctf was obtained as a blackpurple solid after the reaction by ftir analysis the peak of cn at  cm disappeared completely the peaks of triazine at outofplane ring bending  cn stretching   semicircle stretching  quadrant stretching and  cm were determined in the tctctf structures  the peaks at  and  cm are impurity structures of nh co and spch respectively the broad oh peaks between  and  cm correspond to absorption and crystal water or nh figure figure   experimental ftir spectrum of tctctf the red lines showed tctctf peaks and blue lines showed the peaks contained impurity structuresin ref  tctctf was synthesized at a low temperature at room temperature using tfoh the reactivity was low and the product was precipitated during the reaction thus the homogeneous reaction system could not be maintained on the other hand the hightemperature reaction in this study improved the homogeneity as well as the reactivity forming more tctctfcompared to the reaction using tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether tegd as a solvent supporting information s tegd was decomposed in the presence of heated tfoh and a side reaction occurred thus the synthesis of tctctf requires a strong acid such as tfoh with high catalytic activity and high temperature but organic solvents cannot tolerate such conditions by comparing the reaction using zncl supporting information s because the reactivity of zncl was lower than that of tfoh even at higher reaction temperatures  k tctctf was not generated from the above synthetic studies it was found that tctctf was obtained from tct by reacting tfoh with a strong acidity at a high temperature at the boiling point of tfohfigure  shows the xray diffraction xrd pattern of tctctf the peak at ca  was  as staggered packing abc stacking this peak was equivalent to the ab stacking graphite  peak and originated from the layered structure the distance between the tctctf layers was   which was calculated by the peak top of  using the scherrer equation this peak is similar to the results of ref seventeen and sharper than that in ref   and  the peaks at  and  obtained in this work can be assigned as     and   from these results it was found that the reaction using tfoh effectively formed a laminated structure of tctctf on the other hand in the case of using the conventional zncl because a reaction at a high temperature over  k is used to promote the reactivity side reactions other than the formation of a laminated structure occurred and an amorphous structure was formed moreover because the distance between layers was narrower than that of graphite tctctf was   graphite was   the interaction between layers was also stronger than graphite in addition to the van der waals force which is responsible for the interaction between graphite and tctctf in tctctf the electrostatic interaction between the layers due to the polarization between the c and n bonds of triazine was also responsible for the reduction of the interlayer distancefigure   experimental xrd pattern and photograph of tctctf the peaks were assigned by calculated result of staggered packing in supporting information of ref figure  shows scanning electron microscope sem images of tctctf tctctf had flaky and the layered structure this result was consistent with the xrd results from this result in opensystem and liquidphase synthesis at the completely soluble the growth of ctf in the plane direction was large and therefore the interlayer interaction was strong therefore opensystem and liquidphase synthesis was suitable for ctf synthesis from tcttable  shows the chn elemental analysis of tctctf components other than c h and n were calculated as the oxygen atoms because the calculated atomic ratio of cn was nearly equal to  which was the ideal ratio of tctctf tctctf was reacted as intended without side reactions the ho atomic ratio was approximately  thus it was considered that h and o were derived from adsorbed or crystallized water ho from these results the composition formula of tctctf was calculated as cnho compared with the reaction using tegd the atomic ratio of cn was  it was considered that the reaction using tegd did not progress as intended supporting information s it was considered that the nitrogen content decreased because the originally contained water or the alcohol component decomposed from tegd by strong acid reacted with the cyano group of tct and deaminatedfigure  sem images of tctctf a low and b high magnificationtable    elemental analysis of tctctffigure  shows the experimental cs and ns xps spectra of tctctf the experimental peak of cc was adjusted to  ev from the results of the cs and ns spectra it was considered that the triazine structure assigned at  and  ev was the main structure for tctctf figure  and table  in particular the intensity of the cc peak which is an impurity is much smaller than that in a closed system using znclin the conventional method using zncl the cn ratio from the results of elemental analysis was close to  but it was estimated from the xps results that there are many structures other than triazine because cc bonds are rich to compensate for the low reactivity of zncl the reaction was allowed to react at a high temperature of  k or more at such a high temperature decomposition of the triazine ring is considered to be involved therefore although the composition ratio was close to the ideal value the structure was considered to be different from the ideal structure of the ctf therefore tctctf synthesis in the open system in this study is a more structurally controlled synthesis method than that in a closed systemfurthermore from the xps results f and s atoms which may be contaminated by tfoh were not confirmed figure s therefore tfoh did not react with tct and could be removed completely by washing with aqueous nh compared with the reaction using tegd the experimental cs and ns spectra were complex therefore the reactions did not progress as intended figure s this was considered because the originally contained water or the alcohol component decomposed from tegd by strong acid reacted with the cyano group of tct and deaminated this is why the reaction with tegd showed peaks of co co and coo in cs xps these results were the same as those of the elemental analysisfigure   experimental cs and ns xps spectra of tctctf black line was experimental data and color lines were peak fittingtable   reported assignments of xps of tctctffigure  shows the experimental solidstate cnmr spectrum of tctctf after the synthesis of tctctf the peaks at  ppm of cn in tct disappeared completely and the peaks at  and  ppm as triazine were observed this result is consistent with the disappearance of cn in the ftir spectra the peaks at  and  ppm were also confirmed in ref fifteen and similar results were obtained the reason for observing two peaks as triazine it was considered that the triazine ring in the upper and lower layers of the tctctf layers had different environments for carbon atoms in staggered packing such as the ab stack of graphite layers or that the environment around the triazine was different depending on the position of the crystal water the two peaks at   and   ppm in reference were observed as one broad peak with a shoulder and the peaks in this study were observed as two clear peaksfigure  shows the experimental raman spectra of tctctf in general the peak at   cm is called the g band which corresponds to the quadrant stretch of cc bonds in carbon materials such as graphene and the peak at ca  cm is called the d band which corresponds to the defects however ctf does not have a hexagonal network of only carbon atoms such as graphene so even with the ideal structure shown in figure  it is considered that the d band should still be observed this should be due to the fact that unlike a defect it is a sixmembered ring containing a hetero element and has a vacancy structure in the presence of vacancy defects in graphene or carbon nanotubes it has been reported that the d band forms tctctf had g and d bands but the broad peaks were attributed to the presence of impurity components cc or graphitic nitrogen as confirmed by xps the peaks at   and  cm are referred to as g d gd and g bands which are evidence for carbon materials in the raman spectrum of the tctctf sample these peaks were observed as broad peaks which were also observed under closed conditions using zncl in ref  and  the idig which is generally used to discuss the quality of carbon materials was  which was higher than that of graphene with vacancy defects in the basal plane of carbon nanotubes and also higher than that of edges one of the defects on graphite the large idig can be attributed to either vacancies or the presence of graphitic nitrogen tertiary amine in the basal planefigure   experimental solid cnmr spectra of tctctf spinning side bandsfigure   experimental raman spectrum of tctctf excitation wavelength of raman spectrum was  nmin summary tctctf was obtained from tct in an open system and liquidphase synthesis at high temperature using tfoh as the solvent and the acid catalyst without using metal ions the reaction was completely dissolved and no extra byproducts were produced the tfoh used in the reaction was also completely removed with aqueous nh and a highpurity tctctf was obtained tctctf had a layered structure and a composition with a cn ratio of  which is close to the ideal value in other words the tctctf obtained in this study was more structurally controlled and more crystalline than the conventional methodsupporting informationfurther analysis data and the compared data of tctctf synthesis using tetraethylene glycol

production utilizing biomass has received interest in recent decades among them glucose conversion into valuable products has been highly researched owing to its abundance price competitiveness and carbonneutral cycle in this study various types of brnsted acid groups according to their pka values and specific alkyl spacers were impregnated into uio and the catalytic activity for levulinic acid la production from glucose was investigated moreover by controlling the reaction temperature it was demonstrated that the uionhrsoh catalyst with the strongest brnsted acid and desired alkyl spacer can produce la in   yield to the best of our knowledge the effect of an alkyl spacer and brnsted acid group for biomass conversion was first discovered and this research is expected to serve as a fundamental study for designing mof catalysts for la production introductionin recent years the usage of fossil fuels to generate energy and industrial products has been recognized as a major cause of environmental pollution and global warming and has been getting negative recognition in addition concerns about the depletion of fossil fuel reserves and the unstable supply of underground resources have led to advances in green technologies capable of producing sustainable energy and industrial products in this regard biomass which is defined as all the organic materials that come from plants and animals has been highlighted as an alternative resource due to its nontoxicity infinite supply and carbonneutral cycle despite these advantages green technologies are struggling with the relatively low activity and high costs of biomass conversion to produce energy or valuable products requiring technological advancementseveral biomass compounds including forest residue crop and food or animal waste have been considered as potential materials that can be utilized for energy generation and petrofree commodity production among the candidates the researchers focused on lignocellulosic biomass which was the most abundant biomass independent of famine and ethical arguments lignocellulosic biomass was mainly defined as carbohydrate and aromatic polymers derived from forest residues the supramolecular lignocellulosic biomass can be easily depolymerized into monosaccharides cc sugars by hydrolysis and it has been researched as a starting material for the catalytic conversion of biomass because of its low cost and superior solubility in solventsuntil recently several valuable products derived from monosaccharides including hydroxymethylfurfral hmf  sorbitol methyl lactate and levulinic acid la have been reported among them levulinic acid la which was selected as one of the top  chemicals in the us department of energy and lbnet lignocellulosic biorefinery network was considered as the most promising material due to a wide range of functionality and applicability the functional group in la ketone and carboxylic acid can be converted into various derivatives which can be applied in biofuel additives biobased solvents resins plasticisers and petrofree polymers in light of these promising market potentials there are significant interests in producing la with a high yield from biomassla production from monosaccharides usually glucose was performed by an acidcatalyzed multistep reaction and each of these reactions behaves differently depending on the acid type of catalyst scheme  in the first step the isomerization of glucose to fructose was carried out by the cc hydride transfer reaction which was promoted by the lewis acid site thereafter la was produced by sequential dehydration of fructose and degradation of hmf in the presence of ho and brnsted acid sites several studies have investigated the efficient production of la from glucose using the following multistep reaction scheme homogeneous catalysts such as inorganic acids ionic liquids and metal chlorides were first evaluated as la production catalysts it has been reported that glucose can be converted into la in  yield at  oc in the presence of m hso solution  in addition and peng et al  revealed that transition metal chloride especially crcl was effective for the conversion of cellulose to la affording an optimum yield of  at  oc despite the high yield ratio of la from biomass the homogeneous la production system cannot be applied in the industry owing to the requirement of a tricky purification step and catalyst recycling problemheterogeneous catalyst which possesses several benefits such as easy separation catalyst reusability and stability has been developed as an la production catalyst to deal with the limitations of homogenous catalysts nevertheless the proton h donor ability of the heterogeneous catalyst was less than that of the homogeneous catalyst resulting in a deficient production yield of la meanwhile upare et al reported that the brnsted acid site introduced graphene oxide gosoh can produce la from c carbohydrates with  yield following these studies numerous approaches were conducted to introduce brnsted acid sites on heterogeneous catalysts such as metal oxides metal phosphate and zeolites however the introduction of brnsted acid sites through metal chelation and atom doping leads to a decrease in lewis acidity resulting in a heterogeneous catalyst as an inadequate catalyst for la production thus the immobilization of brnsted acid sites on heterogeneous catalysts while maintaining lewis acidity remains an issue in the catalyst industryrecently metalorganic frameworks mofs constructed from metal ionsclusters and organic linkers have attracted attention as heterogeneous catalysts because of their superior surface area tunability and intrinsic lewis acidity in particular mofs have been widely applied as catalysts because additional functionalities can be easily introduced in mof catalysts via several methods including pore encapsulation metalchelating and organic linker modification in fact it was reported that the solidified phosphonic acid hpwo and lysine which can act as brnsted acid incorporated mof catalyst milfe present  of la production yield from glucose whereas milfe shows only  la yield nevertheless impregnation into mofs via pore encapsulation induces a decrease in porosity resulting in reduced contact opportunity between the reactant and catalyst as another approach yabushita et al revealed that po introduced in an mof catalyst nu via metal chelation can present enhanced activity to generate hmf from glucose nevertheless the introduction of brnsted acid by using pore engineering or metal cluster bonding can reduce the porosity and intrinsic lewis acidity of mofs therefore a novel functionalization method that maintains the inherent properties of mofs is required recently chen et al reported that sulfonic acid soh functionalization in mof mil cr via ligand functionalization can enhance the hmf production yield while preserving lewis acidity and porosity these study revealing that the impregnation of brnsted acid sites in mofs can increase the la or hmf production yield but there are no fundamental studies on how brnsted acidity and flexible spacers can affect catalytic activityherein several brnsted acid functional groups with diverse pka values were introduced in the mof catalyst to monitor the effect of brnsted acidity and flexible spacers the functionalization of mofs was performed on the basis of organic linker modification to preserve the intrinsic lewis acidity and porosity of the mof among the tremendous series of mofs uio series zr iv was selected as the platform material owing to the lewis acidity and acid resistance attributed to strong zro bonds various brnsted acid groups with different pka values were introduced into the organic ligand of mofs via postsynthetic modification psm or in situ synthesis moreover the brnsted acid with the desired alkyl spacer to increase the probability of collision with reactants introduced in uio and the catalytic activity for la production from glucose was evaluated it was expected that this study will prove the fundamental idea of the pka value which is a suitable spacer

discussion synthesis and characterization of the catalysts with brnsted acid sitesthe brnsted acid groupfunctionalized mof catalysts used in this study are summarized in figure  the acid moiety with various pka values soh  poh  coh  and oh  were selected to evaluate the effect of the brnsted acid group on the production of levulinic acid la production from glucose uio catalysts containing brnsted acid functional groups were synthesized via a solvothermal method using a stoichiometric mixture specifically the phosphonic acid functional group was introduced by sequential ligand exchange and hydrolysis reaction to avoid loss of lewis acid sites derived by metalphosphonate chelation additionally uio catalysts that possess brnsted acid groups with specific alkyl spacers were prepared by a simple modification reaction to prove the effect of flexibility the alkyl spacer in the catalyst was expected to facilitate the rotational motion of the functional group resulting in an improvement in the reaction activity in order to investigate the effect of the alkyl spacer on the catalytic activity the pka values of the implanted brnsted acid groups with an alkyl spacer rsoh  and rcoh  were similar to those of brnsted acid without a spacer the introduction ratio of brnsted acid was regulated to a similar value  mol figure  metalorganic framework mof catalysts used in this work with various brnsted acid group all brnsted acid groups were introduced about  mol the crystal structure and porosity of the catalysts were analyzed by xrd and n adsorption isotherms figure  the uio with brnsted acid group presented sharp peaks at  o   o  and  o  which is consistent with the xrd pattern of uio figure a this indicates that the crystal structure was preserved even when functional groups were introduced into the framework the n adsorption and desorption isotherms of the catalysts are presented in figure b all catalysts present type i behavior for n adsorption which reveals microporous structure of catalysts the bet surface areas of uio uiooh uiocooh uiosoh and uiopoh were calculated as     and  mg respectively it was expected that the reduced surface area of the catalyst was induced by the increased molecular weight of the catalyst due to the introduction of brnsted acid sites nevertheless the catalysts display a desired surface area resulting in the maintenance of the porosity of the catalystslikewise the uio catalysts with alkyl spacers and brnsted acid sites were characterized as shown in figure c all catalysts present a sharp xrd pattern without noticeable change in uionh this indicates that the crystal structure of the catalysts was almost the same as that of the pristine catalyst even after postsynthetic modification of the organic ligand n isotherms of the uionh with desired alkyl spacer and brnsted acid are shown in figure d compared with the parent uionh sbet was reduced by approximately   after modification but considering the increased molecular weight of the catalyst these values were regarded as reasonable in the sem analysis figure s the morphology and particle size of the uio catalyst with various functional groups were similar to those of uio  nm in this manner it was confirmed that brnsted acid was successfully introduced into the mof catalyst without loss of crystallinity and porosityfigure  xrd patterns a and c and n adsorptiondesorption isotherm at  k b and d of brnsted acid introduced uio catalystsquantitative analysis of the brnsted acid sites was performed using h nmr figure  due to the solubility of mof the uio catalysts were digested using hfdmso  volume ratio and the h nmr spectra of the ligand solution were observed in figure a the organic ligand with brnsted acid group present distinctive peak  to  ppm which was assigned as ohbdc cohbdc sohbdc and pohbdc respectively by comparing the integrated ratio between unmodified bdc  and each peak the introduction ratio of brnsted acid was calculated to be  mol  similarly the uio catalysts with the desired alkyl spacer and brnsted acid group displayed characteristic peaks not only in the aromatic region  ppm but also the alkyl region  ppm in nmr analysis figure b considering the integrated ratio of each peak it was determined that  mol  of the desired alkyl spacer and brnsted acid were successfully introduced into the uio catalyst the detailed functionalization ratio of the brnsted acid groups is shown in table the ftir spectra of the obtained catalysts are illustrated in figure s each catalyst with a specific functional group exhibited a unique peak at  cm co bending  cm co stretching  and  cm symmetric and asymmetric oso stretching  cm poh and  cm po stretching which were derived from the brnsted acid group by combining h nmr and ftir spectra the introduction of brnsted acid sites to uio catalysts was demonstratedfigure  h nmr spectra of brnsted acid impregnated uio catalysts hfdmsod  was used as solventsdespite the confirmation of brnsted acid sites in mof catalysts the maintenance of intrinsic lewis acidity and quantitative comparison of brnsted acid in catalysts is still required with following reference the nhtpd analysis was selected as a suitable characterization tool to measure total acidity of catalysts before measuring nhtpd the thermal stability of mof catalysts was examined by using thermogravimetric analysis tga figure s the functional groupintroduced uio catalysts exhibited a weight decrease at  oc due to combustion of the brnsted acid group therefore the tpd measurement temperature was assigned as  oc figure s using tpd analysis the total acidity was calculated by integrating the peak areas and the total acidity is summarized in table  the total acidity of the catalysts increased with decreasing pka values of the brnsted acid group it was expected that nh gas was captured by the brnsted acid group in the uio series resulting in high acidity to better understand the nature of the acid in situ drift analysis was performed and representatively uionhrsoh was shown in figure s when nh gas was absorbed in the lewis acid site only asymmetric symmetric bending vibrations of coordinated nh were detected on the other hand the nh gas that strongly attached to brnsted acid sites becomes nh ions resulting in   cm   being assigned to the asymmetric symmetric bending vibration of nh by comparing these peak intensities the quantification of the lewis and brnsted acidity can be determined as shown in table  the measured lewis acidity of the mof catalysts was maintained at  mmolg whereas the brnsted acidity increased with a decrease in the pka value by combining these characterizations the successful introduction of brnsted acid sites in mof catalysts while maintaining intrinsic features was confirmedtable  the properties and quantification of acid site of prepared mof catalystsa bet surface area measured by n adsorptiondesorption

ftir drift at a desorption temperature of  oc catalytic performance for la production effect of pka value in brnsted acid sitein order to observe the effect of the pka value on la production the catalytic reaction with brnsted acid site introduced catalysts was carried out in an aqueous state and the glucose conversion and la yield are shown in figure  the catalyst fraction and reaction temperature were fixed at  relative to glucose and  oc respectively all reactions using mof catalysts present almost  glucose conversion within  h whereas only  of glucose was reacted in the blank test it was interpreted that the intrinsic lewis acid and impregnated brnsted acid sites accelerated the consumption of glucose from the viewpoint of la production the uio and uionh catalysts which only possess intrinsic lewis acidity exhibit negligible la yield    even after  h meanwhile the brnsted acidintroduced uio catalysts exhibited   la production yield under the same conditions la production kinetics are displayed in figure s and s moreover the production yield of la varied depending on the type of brnsted acid sites introduced in figure a the uio catalysts with stronger brnsted acid groups lower pka values exhibited higher la production yields considering the multistep la production mechanism it was concluded that the strong brnsted acid group can facilitate sequential dehydration of fructose by donate protons h resulting in a high yield of la similarly the catalyst with a low pka value of the brnsted acid group displayed a higher la yield in a series of uio catalysts with the desired alkyl spacer figure b a detailed comparison of the catalytic activities is summarized in table  the strongest brnsted acid group soh was concluded to be the most suitable functional group for la production and catalysts with sulfonate groups uiosoh and uionhrsoh were utilized for further studyfigure  glucose conversion and la yield using mof catalysts a uio

flexible spacer in catalytic performancethe catalytic reaction with uio and brnsted acid additive sohbdc was conducted to observe the effect of the distance between the lewis acid sites and brnsted acid sites as shown in table  entry  the uio catalyst with brnsted acid additive sohbdc displayed only  la production yield whereas the uiosoh catalyst produced  la with the same catalyst fraction these interesting results indicate that since the uiosoh catalyst possesses both lewis acid sites and brnsted acid sites inside the framework the distance between the two acidic sites was shorter resulting in a high la production yieldto better understand the reaction dynamics within the multistep reaction a kinetic study using two types of brnsted acid introduced catalysts with or without alkyl spacers uiosoh and uionhrsoh was carried out figure  uionhrsoh with brnsted acid and the desired alkyl spacer produced  la within  h whereas uiosoh presented only a  la production yield however for a relatively longer reaction time from  to  h the la yield increment slope of each catalyst was almost similar this indicates that the la yield difference between the two catalysts was derived from the reactivity difference in the relatively short time region from  to  hfigure  kinetic profile la conversion vs reaction time with uiosoh and uionhrsoh catalysts reaction conditions  wt glucose aqueous solution  mol of catalyst  ocdespite the kinetic study of each catalyst the specific role of brnsted acid and alkyl spacer in la production cannot be completely understood because of the complexity of the multistep reaction therefore the reaction products for each step fructose hmf and la conversion were observed at various reaction times figure  in the case of the uiosoh catalyst figure a the concentration of fructose produced by the isomerization of glucose steadily increased up to  h considering that fructose was not only the reaction product for glucose isomerization but also the reactant for la production the increase in fructose concentration means that glucose isomerization was performed more rapidly than la production after a certain time  h the fructose content slowly decreased with an increase in the la yield on the other hand the uionhrsoh catalyst system exhibited a steady decay in fructose concentration after  h figure b this demonstrates that the reaction rate of sequential dehydration of fructose and degradation of hmf facilitated by the brnsted acid site was faster in the case of uionhrsoh than uiosoh we assumed that the flexible alkyl spacer in the uionhrsoh catalyst increases the possibility of conflict between fructose and brnsted acid sites via rotational motion resulting in faster consumption of fructose than uiosoh catalystsfigure  reaction product fructose hmf and la yield with various reaction time using a uiosoh b uionhrsoh as catalysts reaction conditions  wt glucose aqueous solution  mol of catalyst  oc effect of reaction temperature in la productionin order to observe the effect of temperature on la production the la production reaction was conducted at various temperatures using uionhrsoh as the catalyst figure  interestingly the hmf yield gradually decreased with increasing temperature considering that the activation energy of hmf formation from glucose  kjmol was higher than that of la production from hmf  kjmol it can be concluded that the high temperature promotes faster la production and results in a relatively low yield of hmf in actuality the uionhrsoh catalyst displayed a  la production yield at  oc whereas only   yield was observed at  oc with an increase in the reaction temperature the la yield steadily increased but a reduction in la yield was detected at  oc it was considered that the reason for the decrease in la yield at  oc was the sidereaction of hmf the aldehyde and hydroxyl groups can form ketal by polycondensation resulting in the formation of insoluble humin as a byproduct despite the high activation energy of polycondensation  kjmol the high temperature can induce condensation polymerization of hmf resulting in a low yield of la in this manner and the reaction temperature with the highest la yield  oc was selected as the optimal temperature for la production in other series of catalysts the la yield and glucose conversion at various temperatures are summarized in table  similarly the la production yield increased for all cases with increasing reaction temperature on the basis of these data it was concluded that   of la can be produced by the uionhrsoh catalyst at  oc and these catalysts are expected to be future la production catalysts with dualacidic sitesfigure  la and hmf yield from glucose using uionhrsoh catalysts

temperature conclusiondualacidic mof catalysts with lewis and brnsted acids were successfully synthesized by maintaining the intrinsic properties of mofs and were investigated for the production of levulinic acid la from glucose in aqueous solution with various brnsted acid groups the strongest brnsted acid functional group soh exhibited a higher la production yield via sequential dehydration of fructose and degradation of hmf in addition the desired alkyl spacer can accelerate la production yield by increasing the possibility of conflict between the fructose and brnsted acid sites the optimized uionhrsoh catalyst can convert glucose to la in   yield at  oc furthermore by optimizing the reaction temperature a  la production yield was obtained for the uionhrsoh catalyst which had the highest la production yield in the mof catalysts these uionhrsoh catalysts not only exhibit intrinsic lewis acidity but also brnsted acidity and flexible spacers were anticipated as potential

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Acknowledgement REFERENCE,nuclides retention evaluation algorithm of radionuclides retention in lung based on artificial neural networkfengdi qin fanbi meng xiyu yanga  zhengzhong hea songbo tana zhenlei feng jian shanaabstract an accurate revaluation method of the retention of inhaled radioactive substances in lung is key to limit the personal dose human respiratory tract model is widely used in the evaluation however the use of this model requires complex mathematical or physical models which is not conducive to nonprofessional applications and the model update is complicated in this study an artificial neural network model was established to evaluate the retention of radioactive substances in lung studies have shown that artificial neuron network can be used to evaluate retention of radionuclides in respiratory in addition for the artificial neuron network who has completed the training the new data of other models can be used to continue the training which can make the evaluation result of ann close to the new data this model can simplify the process of mathematical and physical model thus making evaluation as accurate as possible at the same time provide a new method for radionuclides retention in lung evaluationkey words respiratory system exposure internal lungs human radiation effectsintroducionthe production of nuclear industry is often accompanied by the release of radionuclides into the atmosphere and high concentration radioactive aerosol environment such as nuclear leakage etc which people exposed to is likely to bring people excessive internal radiationansoborlo et al  rage et al  in addition lungs will be exposed to continuous irradiation caused by longlived radioactive materials deposited in itqianlan et al  it is important to evaluate the retention of radionuclides in lung for calculating the radiation doseqianlan et al  however the clearance process of radioactive substances in lung is very complicated so it is necessary to establish a method or model that can calculate it accuratelyinternational commission on radiological protection icrp putted forward human respiratory tract model hrtm for the first time in icrp publication no in  in order to study the clearance process of radioactive materials in lung icrp  in  the publication icrp publication no published the details of the new model of human respiratory tract in radiation protection icrp  and revised hrtm was given in icrp publication no icrp  analytical solution of different equations of hrtm was putted forward when acutely ingesting radionuclides with unit activity ishigure et al  further an opensource implementation kdep which can evaluate the deposition of radionuclides well based on icrp lung deposition model had been developed klumpp et al  however according to the research of n h harley et al there were errors between the calculated results and the measured values reported by icrpharley et al  comparing with the model parameters were more important for the evaluation of lung dosepuncher et al  many researchers have also analyzed the clearance and retention of radionuclides in human body studies have shown that the deposition fraction of the first and second generation bronchus was the largest and the dose distribution in respiratory tract was unevenzhu et al  high experimental cost and implacable technical requirements also lead to hrtm limitation in applicationzhu et al  sanchezcrespo a and others used lung scintigraphy to evaluate the clearance and transportation of particles in healthy lungssanchezcrespo  furthermore many cases of radionuclides retention were investigated excellentlypoudel et al  due to the uneven distribution of nuclides in respiratory tract and the complicated clearance process the calculation results of retention were inaccurateharley et al  at present a rapid accurate and lowcost method is needed for the calculation of radionuclides retention in respiratory tractartificial neural network ann is a network structure formed by many interconnected units neurons it can simulate relationship between input and output ann has great advantages in dealing with fuzzy random and nonlinear datazhao et al  in this study by the fuzzy processing ability of ann the clearance data of uranium and plutonium in icrp were used and the factors affecting radionuclides clearance and lung retention had been simulated and trained the calculation results of this method were consistent with the evaluation standard of icrp thus this method can reach the purpose of evaluationmethodologyhuman respiratory tract modelthe initial deposition of inhaled radionuclides in lung is related to the median particle size of the activity of radionuclidesicrp  fraction deposition of  m particles is shown in table  during the clearance process the radionuclides deposited in lung are divided into three compartments according to the different state of the sediment in other compartments except et particles in initial state particles in transformed state and bound materialfig icrp  furthermore icrp is classified into three categories according to the size of the radionuclide hemolysis rate in the inhaled respiratory tract type f fast type m middle type s slowicrp fig  model of particle transport relationship between three states the arrow shows the clearance direction of the material and spt sp and st are dissolution rate fb is the fraction of bound state icrp   table  lists parameters of substances in different states given in icrp reporttable  fraction deposition of  m particles in region of the respiratory tracttable  transfer parameters of particles in three states dthe hrtm revised in icrp publication no report includes two major regions the external thoracic airway et and the thoracic region thicrp  et is composed of anterior nasal passage et posterior nasal passage oral passage pharynx and larynx et similarly the thoracic region is composed of bronchiolar bb and alveolar alv the pulmonary lymphatic system is composed of lymphatic tissue lnet associated with the outer thoracic airway and lymphatic tissue lnth associated with the thoracic regionicrp  the model illustrates the clearance process and rate of radionuclides between different compartments in the hrtm according to hrtm and the transformation model of particle states in it a mathematical model can be established to describe the process of radionuclide clearance fig fig  radionuclides clearance model arrow shows the clearance direction p is the particle in initial state b is the bound material and t is the particle in transformed state each clearance process ratio is provided by icrp publication noicrp there are three timedependent clearance processes for particles in the initial state clearance to the transformed state body fluids and bound material hence the change process of the particles in the initial state can be expressed by the dynamic equation eq where  is the amount of particles  is number of particles in initial time is decay constantmoreover particles in transformed state came from particles in the initial state at the same time they will be clarified to body fluids and bound material accordingly retention of particles in transformed state can be expressed by the kinetic equations eq where  is the amount of particles  is number of particles in initial time correspondingly there is a dynamic equation for the particles in the bound materials which can be expressed as a formula eq where  is the amount of bound materialsbased on the three basic equations of eq  eq  and eq  the process of clarification and deposition of radionuclides in the entire respiratory tract can be described by a mathematical model the functions performed by each module are established through matlabsimulink take the alv as an example of the internal structure diagram of the compartment fig fig  simulation model of alv compartmentin order to make it easier to be operated and to establish a radionuclide clarification process each compartment was encapsulated as a subsystem and then it is supposed to establish a data transmission channel for the subsystem in accordance with the clarification process in the icrp publication no during the simulation process the entire clarification process will be analyzed according to the transfer mode and transfer process in the hrtmestablishment of ann modelann has a strong selflearning functionlee et al  ann can establish and store the functional relationship between influencing factors and retention through learning the intake time types and species of particles and retention of nuclides in lung in this study bp back propagation neural network with feedback was used in the training process of bp neural network there are two information transmission lineszhao et al  one is the successive forward propagation of signals and the other is the backward propagation of errors this backward propagation can correct each weight one by one so that the error between the output of ann and hrtm calculation results can be minimizedthe structure of annthe ann structure shown in fig was adopted in this study which includes two hidden layers one input layer and one output layer each neuron sums the neuron data of the previous layer with different weights and then transmits it to the next layer of neurons through the activation functionfig  diagram of the ann structure in which the bias value of neuron is not shown each node represents a neuron a fully connected ann was used in this studyinput and output of annin the process of establishing ann for predicting radionuclide clearance data the main factors affecting radionuclide clearance in lung are considered as follows types of radionuclides f s m etc converted to ascii values median particle size of activity of radionuclides this paper mainly considers  microns so it will not be studied as an influencing factor and intake time so the number of input neurons of ann was set to be  in this study the retention data of radionuclides in each compartment is taken as the target considering that there are  compartments in hrtm and there are two divisions et and th thus the number of neurons in ann output layer is set to be  after considering particles entering bloodthe number of hidden layers and neurons in anna twolayer multilayer perceptron can establish all kinds of region classificationskoyuncu  therefore the number of hidden layers of ann in this study is set to be  the number of neurons of layer  is set to be  according to the outputs of ann moreover the range of number of layer  neurons can be determined based on eq where  and  is the number of neurons of input and output c is a constant range from  to  therefore the numeric range of neurons of layer  can be determined from  to  the best number is  which determined after comparing errors one by oneactivation function and signal transformationactivation function between layer and layer can improve the learning ability of ann for complex questionslee et al  eq  was selected to the activation between hidden layer  and hidden layer  meanwhile eq  was selected as activation function  between hidden layer  and output as well as the levenbergmarquardt lm adopted as training method lee et al if  represents the lth layer the output of the jth neuron then the output of the ann can be expresses as eq where  is the connection weight between the neurons in the lth layer to the lth layer and  is the bias value of the lth layerif e represents the error index of the ann and  represents the actual retention data corresponding to the output neurons then the error function of the ann is eqwhere the determination of the error is crucial for ann which corrects the connection weights between neurons that transmit data to each other through error reverse transmission  so as to achieve the purpose of making accurate prediction eq where j is a jacobian matrix  is a scale factor  is a unit matrix k is an iterations of annwhether the ann can successfully obtain the transmission mechanism of hrtm through training will depend on the correction of weights by errorslee et al  as to the determination of weights the root cause comes from the meansquare error mse between the calculated values of ann and hrtm in each iteration that is eq the retention of radionuclides in lung can drop to a very low level these magnitude data makes the errors of ann decrease rapidly and quit the training process in the processing process this study built a function eq  to preprocess the output data retention fraction and then trained ann such a process can ensure the effective learning of ann figfig  magn   itude transformation and training processresultscomparison of ann results with hrtm resultsthe detention amount of radionuclides in different compartments is differenticrp  take uo the compound of u as an example radionuclides can be cleared to a very low level in  to  days in most compartments however after  days alv and int compartments still have a retention fraction of more than  the ann prediction results fig a and hrtm calculation results fig b is similarfig  retention fraction of uo in various compartmentscompounds formed by u can also be classified as f m and s substancesicrp  the calculated results of ann on these three kinds of substances fig fig   retention of different types of u in lungcalculated results show that the retention of u in type f reached the lowest level in about  hours after it entered the body according to icrp publicationsicrp  icrp  the halflife of type f substances in lung is about  minutes  absorption ann predicted that type m substances of u fig b remained in the lung for about  days the halflife of type m is  hours  absorption and  days  absorption substances of type s comparing type m have a longer retention time fig cd type s substances can only absorb  in  hours while it takes  days to absorb icrp  the clearance trend of ann prediction results figad accords with the detention of radionuclides published in icrp publication no report icrp error analysisann showed some errors in the prediction of radionuclides clearance process in lung and the error results vary in different compartments back propagation used in the research corrects ann by means of error back propagationlee et al  therefore the error caused by ann is inevitable the absolute error directly generated by ann can be expressed by eq where y  is the direct prediction value of ann y is the training goaltherefore the clearance result x of radionuclide in lung can be expressed as eq where  which represents the relative error directly generated by annintegrated error  of ann is subjected to absolute error  directly generated by ann eq  and eq  taking uo as an example within  days the magnitude distribution of relative error is  or less fig a however after the data is converted by eq  the relative error rises by an order of magnitude the average relative errors of other compartments except lnth and int are lower than the error rose wavily with local minima in some time points in fig ab the reason is that in the training process of ann the time point of the training set data is set as the training target therefore the training error of ann at these time points is the minimum the error of prediction results near the trained time point meanwhile is relatively slight the prediction error of other u compounds also maintains this rule fig ce the mean absolute errors of predictions for the four research objects were all at a low level less than  fig ffig  the relationship between error and training time series only thoracic region was consideredthe integrated error predicted by ann in various compartments is different taking uo as an example fig  the more complicated the clearance process of the reservoir is the more difficult it is for ann to learn the retention and the greater the integrated error is bbseq and bbseq are compartments which will be cleared slowly both are only clear to lnth after initial deposition which is easily obtained by ann so the integrated error of those compartments is slight the retention situation of bb and bb consists of two clearance processes comparing bbseq and bbseq it is more difficult for ann to get their retention situation during training thus the integrated error of bb and bb is higher than bbseq and bbseq there are three clearance processes for lnth which need to accept radionuclides from compartments of int bbseq and bbseq therefore the learning process of ann is most difficult in this compartment as well as the integrated error is maximum in itfig   average error of each compartment in thoraxthe error in ann training is uncertain in this study the structural parameters of ann has been determined the reason of uncertain mainly is that random selection of initial parameters such as bias and weights and allocation of training set test set and verification setlee et al  in the prediction process the trained ann is used to predict at this point the prediction error of ann have been determined in the training processperformance of anntaking one of training programs of ann as example uo the regression coefficient between target and ann output is  which proves that the ann training result is close to the lung retention result of radionuclide calculated by hrtm in addition the regression coefficients of ann validation set and test set are  and  respectively and the overall value is  when the epoch was  the ann had the best performance reaching  fig  it indicates that ann constructed in this study can obtain the retention amount of radionuclides in the body effectively after training and make predictionfig   performance of anntraining ann based on the uo of icrp publication no after the completion of the training the retention data of icrp publication no of different proportions will be added to continue the training based on the original training predictions of ann are moving closer to icrp publication no fig a and the regression between icrp publication no and  can be calculated separately fig b as the regression coefficient between icrp ann and icrp increases the regression coefficient between icrp ann and icrp decreases this shows that for the trained ann continuing training with the new data can make the training result closer to the data used for the new training if the latest data are from actual cases the prediction results of ann may be closer to the reality without updating the model and parametersfig  different proportions of icrp report data to continue the training results b is that regression between icrp publication no and  the regression coefficient between the predicted results and reference  increases while that between the predicted results and reference  decreasesprediction results of different substancestaking different types of compounds of u as examples fig  the parameters and process of clearing uf and m substances in hrtm are consistent and the retention of uf and m substances in ann prediction results are the same figs b and b according to prediction results of ann aduuo like uf has the lowest retention in about  days but the rate of aduuo is faster the reason is in hrtm the conversion rate of aduuo from initial state to transformed state is lower than that of uf and at the same time the rate of blood inhalation of transformed aduuo is higher than that of transformed uf icrp  the prediction results of ann were close to those of hrtm and the average relative errors for aduuo and uf are  and  respectively fig  ab and d uf was basically cleared from lungs within one day and the clearance rate was fast but the relative error of ann prediction was high  fig  c and dfig  retention of various compoundsfor pu of types m and s ann predicted well fig d the average relative errors were  and  respectively fig d the pu of type m was cleared around  and the radionuclides remained after  days have no practical significance the pu of type s stayed for a long time and  pu was still unclear after  days the prediction results of m and s categories were close to the situation in icrp publication no report icrp fig  prediction error of ann for different substances ac is the variation of predicted results over time for different substancesdiscussion and conclusionto evaluate the retention of radionuclides in lung quickly based on the theory of hrtm reported by icrp this study simulated the clearance process of radionuclides inhaled once and acutely in lung by using the simulation function of matlabsimulink ann was used for training and several different nuclides were used for verification the results show that the model can predict the retention of radionuclides in each compartment accurately according to the types species and time of input radionuclidessimulink model has advantages in solving different equations so the ann trained data according to the model established by simulink in this study simulink needs to establish different equations based on hrtm before building the model compared with the analytical solution of hrtmishigure et al  simulink model is simpler however the process of establishing simulink model is professional complex and prone to error which makes it difficult to be popularized and applied into practice in contrast as an open source implementation kdep has mature algorithms and performs well in evaluating radionuclides retention based on hrtm klumpp et al the method of this study can avoid the reestablishment of mathematical and physical models which makes the study of radionuclides retention in lung easier in the fundamental of using training ann gaseous radioactive substances such as radon krypton xenon etc have not been studied thoroughly however these gaseous radioactive substances may even be the object of great scientific research for example radon is the second largest carcinogenhenderson et al  and krypton and xenon are the emission gases of nuclear power plantsthere are uncertain in process of evaluating retention of radionuclides by hrtmharley et al  and the development of hrtm is subject to the research influence of respiratory tract morphology dosimetry physiology bioanalysis and measurement clearance and deposition of radioactive substances etc every version of new publication of icrp on hrtm will be revised in model and parameters just to make prediction more accurate in this study ann obtained a trend of nuclides retention timedependent which is close to hrtm this shows that ann can be applied to the evaluation of radionuclides retention in the lungs by using the data retained in report no  directly and continuing to train the neural network trained in report no  the prediction results can approach that in report no  perhaps based on the development of retention measurement ann who completes the training through continuous training of actual cases can make the prediction result close to the actual case harley et al  sanchezcrespo  poudel et al acknowledgementthanks to

covidrelated public stigma is a major challenge with scarce available evidence this study aimed to determine the disparities and factors associated with covidrelated public stigma in the thai populationmethods we conducted a crosssectional study involving a voluntary online survey conducted in thailand from april  to may   we invited  participants to complete a series of questionnaires including the validated covid public stigma scale and relevant covidrelated psychosocial issues multinomial logistic regression was performed to investigate the factors associated with covidrelated public stigmaresults the prevalence of covidrelated public stigma was   confidence interval ci  for nominimal   ci  for moderate and   ci  for high we observed disparities in the prevalence of covidrelated public stigma according to participant characteristics and psychosocial factors using the nominimal group as a reference group the six predominant risk factors significantly associated with a moderate and high degree of covidrelated public stigma were middleaged adults or older male divorcedwidowedseparated current quarantine status moderatesevere fear of covid and mediumhigh perceived risk of covid additional risk factors significantly related to a high degree of covidrelated public stigma were religion buddhist region of residence noncapital city and exposure to covidrelated informationconclusions disparities in covidrelated public stigma due to sociodemographic and psychosocial issues are frequent in the thai population to reduce public stigmatization early identification of vulnerable groups and the development of tailored mitigation strategies should be implemented during the pandemickey words covid fear mental health perceived risk public stigmaintroductionthe incidence of psychosomatic illness has increased since the emergence of coronavirus disease  covid  these conditions are expected natural psychological responses to unpredictable fastspreading infectious diseases like what had been experienced from prior outbreaks such as sarcov or mercov dubey et al  measures to contain the spread of the virus such as lockdowns home confinement strategies restriction of travelling and misinformation obtained from online social networking sites have been shown to be detrimental dubey et al  ransing et al covid has caused universal awareness anxiety and distress partly due to fear of infection leading to the socalled covid effect international federation of red cross and red crescent societies and unicef  kaufman et al  the effect provokes diseaseassociated social stigma xenophobia and discrimination against people who are perceived to have been in contact with the virus or those with certain ethnic backgrounds international federation of red cross and red crescent societies and unicef  social stigma or public stigma of infectious diseases has long been acknowledged in the past such as hiv hepatitis c virus tuberculosis and zika and is now acknowledged amid the covid pandemic baldassarre et al  public stigma usually creates discriminatory behaviors such as isolation refusal to receive services harassment and bullying people who are victims of social stigma can develop social avoidance denial of healthcare and perhaps even be in danger of violence dubey et al  the incidence of hate crime towards specific ethnicities ie asians has been reported in the united states and worldwide in addition stigma toward covid may lead to adverse mental health outcomes including suicidal behavior griffiths and mamun  guo et al to date few studies have reported the prevalence and factors associated with covidrelated public stigma none of the existing studies have focused on public stigma in thailand while the pandemic is still ongoing understanding covidrelated public stigma and its related factors can help define the target population prone to social stigma and develop tailored mitigation strategies therefore we conducted this study to determine the prevalence and factors associated with covidrelated public stigma in the thai populationmethodstudy design and participantsthis was a crosssectional analytical study based on the health outcomes and mental health care evaluation survey under the pandemic situation of covid homecovid the details of the protocol have been published elsewhere nochaiwong et al  in brief an open online voluntary survey encompassing a set of questionnaires was sent via the surveymonkey platform which limits onetime participation per unique internet protocol

participant characteristic strata we applied a twostage multinomial logistic regression approach to determine factors associated with the degree of covidrelated public stigma using nominimal as a reference group in the first stage the crude association between participant characteristics and the degree of public stigma moderate or high was analyzed using univariable multinomial logistic regression models to identify candidate risk factors next candidate risk factors with a pvalue  were included in the multivariable multinomial logistic regression models using the stepwise backward

disparities in covidrelated public stigma in the general thai population we found that covidrelated public stigma was common during the pandemic in thailand critically the estimated prevalence of a high degree of covidrelated public stigma was frequent at   ci  this rate was highly variable by participant characteristics and psychosocial issues regarding the pandemic moreover our risks set findings for the development of a mediumhigh degree of covidrelated public stigma that can provide information on the targetspecific population and minimize public stigmatization in public health settingsfew studies have addressed covidrelated public stigma in the general population owing to the lack of a validated tool these studies have shown that covidrelated public stigma is a common phenomenon in several countries cassianimiranda et al  chory et al  jiang et al  li et al  smith et al  zhang et al  similar to our study the prevalence of moderate and high degrees of covidrelated public stigma accounts for more than half of the surveyed population in many countries furthermore our findings underscore that participant characteristics as well as psychosocial issues during the pandemic are significantly associated with the degree of covidrelated public stigmacollectively based on common risk factors our findings revealed that middleaged adults or older   years had a higher risk of being at a moderatehigh degree of covidrelated public stigma than young adults not surprisingly the older population particularly in advanced age and with multimorbidities is at risk of a severe and critical stage if infected with covid leading to greater awareness of infection males have also been reported to have more severe covid gao et al  which may be recognized as a person at risk of being a moderatehigh covidrelated public stigma than others interestingly the explanation may be dealing with masculinity in which such norms are social rules that expect men to be strong and may invoke behaviors of responsibility to protect their family and community chatmon  according to previous reports mostafa et al  yuan et al  we found that cohabitants are more aware of covid infection due to fear of contagion to their couple additionally married people particularly healthcare workers illustrated more personalized stigma and had concerns about public attitudes mostafa et al  people who experienced the current quarantine status certainly perceived a higher risk of covid infection and had a higher stigma score in our observation some studies have shown that quarantine cases are prone to selfstigma and stigmatization by society yuan et al  in addition a study in quarantined healthcare workers also reported that guilt towards family members and friends leads to avoidance of contact with neighbors and the community do duy et al  finally both perceived fear and risk of covid infection were recognized as strong factors contributing to covidrelated public stigma in our study indeed the feeling of fear and subsequently perceived risk of a newly emerging infectious disease usually arises from the uncertain and unpredictable course of the disease technology including the internet social media creates infodemics passing around the news of covid cases mortality and its communicability can accelerate more fear and perceived dangerousness to people moreover stigma from perceived risk can also be mediated by fear of covidapart from the common factors some unique variables including religion buddhism living in a noncapital city and exposure to covidrelated information are associated with only a high degree of covidrelated public stigma in thailand buddhism contributes to most of the population  followed by muslims  christians and others  national statistical office and ministry of digital economy and society  buddhists are associated with the doctrine of cultivating compassion to attenuate prejudiced attitudes towards other social groups davidson and anne  in the case of the covid pandemic comparison with the irreligious population may reflect a few aspects including liberality and acceptance of the behaviors of others including mistakes or errors however some hidden residual factors such as borderline personality narcissism or carelessness towards religion predominantly in the younger population which are associated with lower stigmatization meaney et al  yuan et al  were not investigated in our study therefore this finding requires further confirmation for residential areas we postulated that people living in the noncapital area had a higher degree of covidrelated public stigma because of their fear and perceived risk of covid infection spreading from the capital city as most cases in thailand at the time of data collection were based on the capital city and its environs theoretically media exposure has been suggested as a potential factor for perceived stigmatization among people at a high risk of contagion duan et al  in this case we can apply to covid that media images and influences may lead to prejudice and discrimination resulting in violence against some ethnic groups such as asian people in the us and worldwideto our knowledge this is the first study to report on the prevalence of covidrelated public stigma in thailand this study was based on a nationwide survey with a large sample size unlike previous studies we used the validated covidpss to measure covidrelated public stigma among the thai population nochaiwong et al  however our results should be used with consideration of some limitations first we used wave i of the homecovid representing only the early phase of the pandemic when circumstances could be different from other periods we also lacked information regarding the knowledge of covid infection in which misinformation or lack of knowledge may generate more fear and anxiety about the disease and increase stigma although stigma changes over time and context the results of this study are believed to be beneficial for future emerging infectious diseases second our findings were based on an open online survey therefore information bias should be considered in addition it may be generalized only to those with access to the internet third despite an ancillary analysis confirming the risk factors in line with the main analysis uncertainty with respect to exposure to covidrelated information resilient coping perception and the risk of covidrelated public stigma need to be confirmed in further studies fourth further associations between public stigma and adverse mental health ie anxiety stress and depression are warranted to address public health concerns lastly the longerterm effect of stigma research is needed because our findings reflected only the shortterm effects and the impact of stigma may change as the pandemic evolvesgiven the high burden of mental health and psychosocial issues during the pandemic it is crucial to minimize covidrelated public stigma due to the negative consequences of stigma including an unwillingness to disclose covid infection or testing and seeking treatment recently a randomized trial in the general united states population by valeri et al  suggested that videobased interventions involving reliable information on covid prevention strategies video encouraging digital social activity and video sensitizing to covidrelated stigma are effective in reducing covidrelated public stigma however its utility could be limited by its generalizability to other populations and crosscultural adaptation to larger public health effects to help the target population and supplement the previous intervention trial our findings support proactive mental health surveillance by identifying the person who may be vulnerable or at risk of public stigmatization in particular middleaged adults or older male sex marrieddomestic partnership divorcedwidowedseparated buddhist living in the noncapital city current quarantine status high perceived fear or risk of covid infection to promote mental health wellbeing multimodal strategies involving public health education and knowledge programs for empowering and supporting vulnerable populations and antistigma policies enforced in legal legislation should be promptly implemented during the pandemicin conclusion covidrelated public stigma is highly prevalent and varies among thai populations the results of this study highlight the disparities in the prevalence of covidrelated public stigma according to sociodemographic and psychosocial issues our study also showed the possibility of identifying vulnerable groups and participants who are at risk of stigma during the pandemic which should be targeted by strategies aimed at mitigating the impact of public stigma on health

phenotype among alcoholrelated liver diseases while metabolic syndrome is a dominant risk factor of incident nonalcoholic fatty liver disease the role of metabolic syndrome in alcoholic fatty liver disease has not been clarified yetmethodsa retrospective cohort study was performed at a health checkup center in japan subjects consisted of male participants without fatty liver who consumed ethanol of  gweek or higher adjusted hazard ratios and  confidence intervals at the baseline examinations for incident alcoholic fatty liver disease were estimated using cox modelresultsa total of  participants were included in this study during  personyears of followup  new cases of alcoholic fatty liver disease developed  per  personyears after adjustment for age smoking status alcohol consumption the hazard ratio for a  kgm increase in body mass index was   the hazard ratio of subjects with high triglyceride and low highdensity lipoproteincholesterol levels were   and   respectivelyconclusionsobesity high triglyceridemia and low highdensity lipoproteincholesterolemia are independent risk factors of alcoholic fatty liver disease in japanese men who consumed alcohol habitually in people with these risks triglyceride lowering and highdensity lipoproteincholesterol raising by improving insulin resistance and weight maintenance in addition to abstinence from alcohol would be effective in preventing the development of alcoholic fatty liver diseasekeywordsalcoholrelated liver disease fatty liver obesity dyslipidemia metabolic syndromebackgroundas viral hepatitis is being eradicated alcoholrelated liver disease arld is attracting attention as a major cause of chronic liver disease cirrhosis as well as hepatocellular carcinoma  arld is a chronic liver disorder caused by habitual consumption of alcohol for this reason warnings and social support for alcohol dependence have been continuously implemented however the prevalence of arld is not decreasing as it persists worldwidesimultaneously hepatic steatosis has attracted attention in individuals who consume alcohol alcoholic fatty liver disease afld is indeed a syndrome as a counter concept of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld in nafld hepatocyte steatosis due to overnutrition is considered the cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma  furthermore in viral hepatitis it has been reported that steatosis caused by viral infection is a risk factor in the development of chronic fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma  thus there is a concern that hepatic steatosis itself may be a fundamental problem in various chronic liver diseaseshistorically malnutrition has been the major problem in individuals with arld on the other hand epidemiological studies have shown that hepatic steatosis is a risk factor of cirrhosis in arld as well as nafld and that cirrhosis is a risk factor in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma  afld has been considered a risk factor of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in addition to the volume of alcohol consumption or genetic susceptibility for them  highrisk lifestyle including diet and smoking as well as body weight gain have been recognized as risk factors of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and also as underlying factors in individuals with afld  these risk factors are also associated with metabolic syndrome in fact the prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome in arld patients is as high as  and  respectively and their comorbidity has been reported to be associated with increased liverrelated mortality in arld patients  thus metabolic syndrome might have a pivotal role in arld and nafldas described above in arld steatosis and metabolic syndrome are increasingly recognized as prognostic factors however compared with epidemiological studies on nafld the role of metabolic syndrome in the natural history of afld has not been completely elucidated therefore we performed a retrospective cohort study to determine the different influences of components of the metabolic syndrome on the development of afldmethodsstudy population and designin this study we analyzed the data which was registered as the nafld in gifu area longitudinal analysis nagala study the nagala study database consists of the results of health checkup programs apparently healthy local citizens who live mainly in gifu prefecture the central region of japan received the health checkup programs at asahi university hospital annually and biannually the aim of the health checkup programs was to detect chronic diseases associated with lifestyle and malignant neoplasms in healthy citizensdata collection and measurementsanthropometric clinical and laboratory evaluation was conducted anthropometric data involved height body weight and blood pressure body mass index bmi was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared a standardized selfadministered questionnaire was used to collect information on each participants medical history and lifestyle factors including smoking habits alcohol consumption and physical activity smoking was defined as the use of tobacco and smoking status was categorized into three groups never smoker exsmoker and current smoker we used data on the amount and type of alcoholic beverages consumed per week to estimate weekly ethanol intake subjects with an ethanol intake   gweek at baseline were defined as subjects who consume alcohol habitually  participants who regularly played some sport at least once a week were classified as exercisersmetabolic abnormality was defined as follows  high blood pressure systolic blood pressure   mmhg or diastolic blood pressure   mmhg or the use of oral antihypertensive medications  high blood glucose fasting blood glucose   mgdl or receiving antidiabetic medications  high triglycerides fasting plasma triglycerides   mgdl or receiving medications for high triglycerides  low hdl high density lipoprotein cholesterol fasting plasma hdl   mgdl or receiving medications for low hdl cholesterol definition of afldafld was defined as fatty liver found in participants who consume alcohol habitually fatty liver was diagnosed by the findings of abdominal ultrasonography performed by a trained technician  among the four known diagnostic criteria hepatorenal echo contrast liver brightness deep attenuation and vascular blurring hepatorenal echo contrast and liver brightness are required for fatty liver the ultrasonographic definition is the same as those for nafldstatistical analysisbaseline characteristics were summarized as frequency percentage for categorical variables and as median interquartile range iqr for continuous variables characteristics at the onset of afld or at the time of the last physical examination of nonafld subjects were summarized in the same way comparisons of categorical variables between subjects with and without afld were performed with the pearsons chisquared test those of continuous variables were performed with the kruskalwallis test adjusted cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios hrs and  confidence intervals cis for development of afld according to the components of the metabolic syndrome at baseline age smoking status and alcohol intake were considered as confounders personyears were calculated as the sum of the followup periods from baseline to the occurrence of afld or the last physical examination statistical analysis was performed using jmp version  software sas institute inc cary nc usa we used twosided

and low hdlcholesterolemia were independent risk factors of afld in japanese men who consume alcohol on the other hand among the components of the metabolic syndrome hypertension and high glucose were not significant risk factors the volume of habitual alcohol consumption at baseline does not predict incident afldfatty liver in nondrinking citizens is widely recognized as nafld nafld is the hepatic phenotype of the metabolic syndrome and obesity and metabolic abnormalities are risk factors for its incidence  nonalcoholic steatohepatitis nash is observed in a part of individuals with nafld and the pathology of nash seems to be similar to that of chronic hepatitis in subjects with arld  nash is a risk factor of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma  these findings suggest that hepatic steatosis in subjects who consume alcohol in other words afld could be a risk factor of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma  it is unclear whether afld is a phenotype of metabolic syndrome like nafld or not  our study revealed that three of the five components of the metabolic syndrome obesity hypertriglyceridemia and low hdlcholesterolemia are significant risk factors of incident afld on the other hand all components of metabolic syndrome are strong risk factors of incident nafld  the results of the present study suggest that overnutrition and abnormal lipid metabolism might be important triggers for the development of liver steatosis in men who consume alcohol habitually previous report showed that overweight individuals are more likely to develop hypertriglyceridemia due to alcohol consumption than lean individuals  and individuals with obesity and abnormal lipid levels may synergistically induce liver steatosis under alcohol consumption abstinence from alcohol alone is not sufficient to prevent the development of afld and attention to metabolic abnormalities is also necessary weight maintenance in obese alcohol consumers and improvement of insulin resistance in alcohol consumers with high triglycerides and low hdlcholesterol levels may be important in preventing the development of fatty liverin patients with metabolic syndrome chronic inflammation of visceral adipose tissue leads to increase in free fatty acid ffa from adipocytes high level serum ffa increases hepatic ffa uptake which subsequently upregulates very lowdensity lipoprotein vldl synthesis in the liver upregulated hepatic ffa uptake also increased carbohydratederived de novo lipogenesis via increased sterol regulatory elementbinding protein srebpc expression  adipokine abnormalities such as decreased adiponectin play a role in fat accumulation on the other hand alcohol consumption increases the hepatic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydroxide nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ratio which leads to impaired mitochondrial betaoxidation of fatty acids increased fatty acid synthesis and increased hepatic triglycerides  alcohol can upregulate srebpc expression directly via acetaldehyde and indirectly via stimulation of factors including early growth response protein and tumor necrosis factor  alcohol also downregulates factors that decrease srebpc expression including adiponectin  ethanol consumption directly or indirectly inhibits peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor  furthermore adenosine monophosphateactivated protein kinase ampk increases acetyl coenzyme a carboxylase acc activity and decreases carnitine palmitoyltransferase cpt activity resulting in fat accumulation  thus nafld and afld share common etiological mechanisms such as altered expression of lipid metabolismrelated transcription factors and abnormalities in adipokines these mechanisms can explain the similarity in pathological features and natural history hypertension and hyperglycemia rather than obesity and abnormal lipid metabolism may be the unique pathogenetic factors in nafld but these need to be assessed by future researcha lipid profile of high triglycerides and low hdlcholesterol is common in subjects with fatty liver  insulin resistance is a strong underlying mechanism of this dyslipidemia  leading to increased rates of hepatic triglyceride synthesis and vldl particle production followed by low hdlcholesterol  while alcohol consumption does not produce favorable changes in hypertriglyceridemia it may induce an increase in hdl levels by a mechanism that inhibits cholesteryl ester transfer protein cetp activity  although hdl plays beneficial multifaceted roles in the presence of inflammation oxidative stress and glycemic abnormalities hdl particles may be converted to dysfunctional molecules with proatherogenic effects  circulating levels of hdl are reduced in patients with nafld suggesting the presence of dysfunctional hdl particles in these patients  the protective effect of high hdlcholesterolemia against the development of afld and the importance of hdl quality in afld patients have not yet been investigated and further studies are neededour study has limitations first our database consisted of apparently healthy citizens who underwent a health checkup program our sample may contain more healthconscious people than general population further our epidemiological study is complementary to epidemiological studies that consist of hospital patients who consume alcohol habitually second this study was conducted in japanese men and the results may differ in other racial and ethnic groupsconclusionsour study shows that obesity high triglyceridemia and low hdlcholesterolemia are independent risk factors of incident afld in japanese men who consume alcohol habitually in patients with these risks triglyceride lowering and hdlcholesterol raising by improving insulin resistance

WUIYU_2_чд╛хМ║шбАх╕╕шзД_input.json,Research paper_Journal article,2783,2, 18,0,4,INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION,the association of the alteration of blood routine check parameters and cognitive impairment shenzhen ageingrelated disorder in chinaabstract objective previous studies have indicated that there is a correlation between marker alterations in routine blood checks and cognitive impairment  in our research we aimed to explore the relationship between marker alterations in routine blood checks and cognitive impairment methods in this retrospective casecontrol study  people over  years of age were enrolled from  community health centers in luohu district of shenzhen city from  to  according to the mmse score and educational level  participants were divided into a cognitive impairment group n and a normal cognitive function group n nonparametric test chisquare test and binary logistic regression were applied to analyze the obtained data results compared to the normal cognitive function group the lymphocyte to monocyte ratio lmr packedcell volume pcv and platelet count plt in the cognitive impairment group were significantly lower   vs     vs     vs   p respectively and monocyte count and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration mchc were higher    vs       vs    p respectively  in addition mchc odds ratio or  condence interval ci p   and pcv odds ratio or  condence interval ci p   were independently associated with cognitive impairment conclusion the alterations of some blood routine check parameters including the reduction of lmr pcv and plt and the elevation of monocyte count and mchc may be associated with cognitive impairment therefore the alterations of blood routine check parameters might have diagnostic and predictive value for dementia patientsintroductiondementia is an increasingly common syndrome in the aging population alzheimers diseasead is the main type of dementia which has a devastating impact on global human health and the economy over the past decades many scientic experiments have been conducted to explore the pathology of ad to discover novel treatments ad is characterized by neuronal and synaptic degeneration together with an extensive number of amyloidbeta a plaques and neurofibrillary tangles which may have occurred before symptoms appeared screening reliable and suitable biomarkers before their clinical manifestations become apparent has been an urgent drive for ad investigators compared to the cerebrospinal uid csf which is now widely used as a diagnostic source to aid the clinical diagnosis of ad peripheral blood samples are easier to collect and noninvasive as highly invasive procedures are not appropriate for the screening process accumulating evidence shows that besides the wellknown markers a and tau protein in blood many peripheral blood routine parameters may be novel markers to reflect the prognosis of ad and other neurological disorders but results are inconsistent and lack reproducibility routine blood biomarkers may be correlated with cognitive impairment it has been shown that mpv and pdw are decreased in patients with mci and ad lower hemoglobin levels are associated with cognitive impairment and elevated rdw is related to reduced brain volume and cognitive dysfunction therefore in our study we aimed to investigate the association between alterations in peripheral blood parameters and cognitive impairment among the elderly in shenzhen citymethodsstudy populationin this study we enrolled  participants aged over  years from  community health centers in luohu district shenzhen city from  to  finally  participants were eligible for the analysis and the inclusion criteria were as follows age  years intact visual and auditory function and ability to complete the mmse test as the purpose of this study was to analyze routine blood parameters it was necessary to exclude diseases associated with acute or chronic infectious diseases malignant tumors blood system diseases and severe liver and kidney diseases that may aect routine blood indicators as well as other neurological disorders that could lead to cognitive impairment written informed consent was obtained which included permission for the analysis and data sharing this study was approved by the institutional review board of each participating site according to the mmse score and education level participants were finally divided into a cognitive impairment group n and a normal cognitive function group nclinical variablesthe routine laboratory parameters analysis was measured

cognitive impairment group and a normal cognitive function group and compared the differences between the two groups including demographic and laboratory results the kolmogorovsmirnov test was used to assess the normality of continuous variances participants characteristics were summarized as mean standard deviation or median first quartile third quartile for continuous data dependent on their distribution and counts proportions for categorical variables continuous data were analyzed using the mannwhitney test if there was a skewed distribution category data were analyzed using the chisquare test a binary logistic regression analysis was performed for statistically different indicators all statistical analyses in this study were performed using spss software version  ibm spss inc chicago il usa and statistical signicance was set at p  resultsin total  elderly with cognitive impairment median age  females  and  elderly with normal cognitive function median age   females  were included in our study there was no signicant difference in sex between the two groups in terms of laboratory parameters the followings were signicantly dierent between the cognitive impairment group and the normal cognitive function group as shown in table  lmr vs  pcv vs  plt vs  prespectively monocyte count   vs   p and mchc    vs    p the binary logistic regression showed that mchc odds

results of associations of peripheral blood biomarkers with cognitive impairmentstatistically signicant differences at ptaileddiscussionin this study we evaluated the association between alterations in routine blood parameters and cognitive impairment among  elderly patients according to our results we found that older age decreased lmr pcv and plt and an increase in monocyte count and mchc were associated with cognitive impairment among the elderly which may contribute to the early evaluation and diagnosis of adplatelets play important roles in neurodegenerative cardiovascular and psychiatric diseases and have been widely used as a peripheral model to study the molecular mechanisms of ad platelets are the primary source of circulating app and app may represent the major source of a the cleavage product of app detected in whole blood it has been demonstrated that amyloid precursor protein app is expressed at similar levels in platelets and the brain previous studies have suggested that platelet app metabolism may promote a accumulation in the brain one recent study identified essential functions of the app family for normal hippocampal function and circuits during development one study showed that the platelet level was statistically lower in patients with ad which is consistent with our findings  studies have shown that platelets can accumulate and release neurotransmitters such as serotonin glutamate and dopamine to our knowledge the glutamate is a pivotal excitatory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system which is related to cognitive function it was also verified that the tau protein another important pathophysiological component of ad is present in platelets in addition it has been proven that platelet size could reect platelet activity which is related to a variety of proinammatory diseases mpv the most commonly used measure of platelet size is an early marker of activated platelets and has different trends in different disease conditions pdw another platelet index could also indicate variations in platelet size although some previous studies have indicated that mpv and pdw were decreased in mci and ad patients we did not find significant differences in the mpv and pdw levels between these two groups table in our study there were significant differences in the monocyte count and lmr between the two groups table  the inflammatory response is known to be a chief factor in the generation of a plaques and neurofibrillary tangles which initially execute protective functions and eventually result in neural degeneration and the manifest symptoms of ad bloodderived leukocyte subpopulations including lymphocytes monocytes and neutrophils have been identified in the brains of patients with alzheimers disease and in corresponding animal models monocytes could reflect the innate immune inflammatory status in the circulation and chronic inammation might cause an increase in the monocyte count circulating in the blood subsequently high monocyte levels may activate glial cells to secrete cytokines such as il and tnf to damage the integrity of the bloodbrain barrier bbbwhich is critical in the pathogenesis of ad increasing evidence has shown that serum levels of neopterin produced by activated monocytes are related to their capacity to release ros which is higher in ad patients than in agematched healthy controls in our previous studies we found that high plasmalevels of aconsistently increased the number of monocytes in the spleen of tg mice in line with several studies decreased lymphocyte count in the cognitive impairment group was observed between these two groups although there was no significant difference in our study the decrease in lymphocyte count as part of the immune regulatory barrier could reflect the bodys stress response tnf released by microglia is able to recruit lymphocytes from the peripheral circulation across the bbb into the cns which leads to a reduction in their numbers in the peripheral circulation furthermore it has been shown that increased telomerase activity in lymphocytes could result in the reduction of lymphocyte proliferation in patients with alzheimers disease with regard to neutrophils the increase in neutrophil count is usually related to the occurrence progression and severity of inflammation the depletion or inhibition of neutrophils reduces alzheimers disease pathogenesis and cognitive impairment in mouse models of cognitive dysfunction in recent years an increasing number of studies have focused on nlr a combined inammatory biomarker that could have an advantage over a single leukocyte subtype and have relatively higher clinical signicance the potential role of the nlr in ad was first investigated by kuyumcu et al who found that the nlr was significantly higher in ad patients than in controls several studies have also reported that elderly people with ad have a higher nlr than healthy controls although we did not find a significant difference in our study in summary it was thought that the nlr is not specific enough to be used as a definitive diagnostic tool for ad or mciour data indicated that the pcv hct level decreased in the cognitive impairment group which is consistent with a previous study pcv is viewed as a simple indicator of the number and volume of rbcs the erythrocyte count and hemoglobin level were not significantly different between the two groups but were lower than those in the normal cognitive function group ad is a complex multifactorial disease and anemia is known to be associated with alzheimers disease ad studies have suggested that lower hemoglobin levels are associated with poor cognition several mechanisms might explain this phenomenon hemoglobin is a hemecontaining protein that binds to oxygen carbon monoxide and nitric oxide erythrocytes  rbcs are the most common location of hemoglobin it is well known that the brain oxygen supply is mainly derived from oxygen carried by rbcs numerous studies have revealed that exposure to hypoxia induces amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein app leading to the accumulation of amyloid peptides in the brain notably in response to alzheimers disease microglia defend neurons by surrounding senile plaques to protect the brain and decrease damage its demonstrated that hypoxia compromises the mitochondrial metabolism of alzheimers disease microglia via hifone more possible explanation is that iron an important component of hemoglobin involved in the transport of oxygen is accumulated in tissue stores and not adequately mobilized in ad fauxet al found signicantly greater prevalence of abnormally high serum ferritin in ad together with lower plasma iron levels and transferrin saturation in ad which is in line with that iron metabolism was disrupted in cortical neurons in mouse models additionally studies have indicated that hemoglobin is a normal component of nerve cells which plays a role in intraneural oxygen homeostasis moreover decreased hemoglobin levels were associated with decreased cortical thickness in the frontal temporal parietal and occipital regions which are vital areas related to cognitive function besides hemoglobin it has been suggested that complementcr mediation is the predominant mechanism of a capture by erythrocyteswe found that the mchc level in the cognitive impairment group was higher than that in the normal group   vs   p which is consistent with the results of a previous study in fact results about mchc have always been controversial among different studies and several studies have demonstrated that decreased mchc is related to cognitive impairment while others have found that mchc value was not correlated with memory and cognitive abilities mchc indicates the amount of hemoglobin per unit volume which correlates the hemoglobin content with the volume of the cell therefore it is difficult to explain the results of elevated mchc according to the current literaturethere are several limitations to the present study first it should be more accurate if we combined the mmse with neuroimaging markers to evaluate cognitive function second we did not rule out some chronic comorbidities including hypertension hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus which are important confounding factors that may affect blood cell proles although we have found that differences in parameters are associated with cognitive impairment it remains unclear whether these changes are causes or resultsin summary our study suggests that biomarkers in routine blood samples may be related to cognitive impairment which is demonstrated by the decrease in lmr pcv and plt and the elevation of monocyte count and mchc further studies are needed to investigate the pathophysiological and clinical signicance of these changes in blood cells to offer new insights for the prevention and treatment of ad

the classroom and delivered via a web conferencing system however it should be noted that the implementation of hybrid classes will vary depending on the ratio of participants in the classroom to participants online in addition it is necessary to consider what equipment to use before conducting the class to allow both participants in the classroom and online to speak please check with your department on the usage of equipmentthe requirement for this type of media class online class is that the class is held simultaneously and interactively this requirement can be met by using a web

for this class type could be video materials created by the instructor recordings of classes held realtime using a web conference system and readymade video materials such as ocw open course ware and mooc massive open online coursethe requirements for this type of media class online class are the following twosufficient education is provided through questions and answers correction guidance etc by having teaching assistants meet students in person outside the classroom for every class or by having the classs instructors or teaching assistants use the internet or other appropriate procedures immediately after the relevant classthere is ensured opportunity for students to exchange opinions about the relevant classtherefore simply posting course materials does not meet the requirements for this class type to meet the requirements it is necessary to prepare web bulletin boards the bulletin board function in itclms is available at the university of tokyo and encourage students to exchange

consent FSR Collaborators Objectives Our mission Future perspectives,establishing evidence to improve stroke treatmentwhat is the fsr fukuoka stroke registrythe number of stroke patients is increasing with an aging society more effective preventive therapy against stroke and more efficacious poststroke therapy are needed however data on the epidemiology clinical outcomes and prognosis of stroke patients are currently insufficient therefore an urgent establishment of evidencebased medicine ebm for stroke is required we established a multicenter registry system of patients with acute stroke known as the fukuoka stroke registry fsr this database consists of clinical data on patients with stroke who were admitted to one of seven stroke centers in fukuoka japan within  days of onset these participating medical centers are equipped with stroke care units and can provide the best medical services currently available for stroke patients were diagnosed based on standardized diagnostic criteria and underwent optimal treatment we investigated individuals at risk of stroke patient treatment how the treatment improves symptoms or imposes residual deficits and patients lives after stroke in the long term this database clarifies the pathogenesis clinical course outcomes and prognosis of stroke patients our goal was to reduce stroke occurrence and improve activities of daily living and quality of life in patients with stroke using the results of our research fsrethical aspectsthe management of personal information in each medical institution strictly complies with related personal information protection laws and guidelines for the safe management of medical information systemsepidemiological and clinical research were developed in accordance with the ethical guidelines for epidemiological and clinical studies respectively and the research content was approved by the ethical review board of each medical institutionfor genetic research the procedure of obtaining informed consent consideration for the contributor handling of samples protection of personal information and consideration for each patient was conducted in accordance with human genome and genetic analysis ethical guidelines and has been examined and approved by the ethical review board of each medical institutionthe environment in which the correlation analysis of genetic and clinical information is conducted is limited to the main research institution kyushu university therefore more stringent safety control measures to protect information are providedfsr protects personal

stroke database information system the academic section and research institute for information technology of kyushu university in collaboration with ntt data corporation has completed the database system and is being monitored to ensure the highest level of information security in network communications and data storage facilitiesconsent samples were stored under strict conditions when a consenting donor requests the destruction of the contributed samples the samples are disposed of according to the sample disposal regulationspersonal information protectionin the prospective study all information about the consenting patients such as medical records prognostic investigation and blood samples plasma dna etc were converted into linkable anonymous informationin this study the name address and contact number were deleted from the samples and each sample was given a code so that it was unrecognizable by anyone except the personal information administrator and the information and samples were entered into the database under stringent controlthe reference tables that link the codes to the patients were strictly controlled by the personal information administrator of the department of medical informatics kyushu university hospitalin this way even the researcher in charge will not be able to recognize the dna owner in genetic analysis however if there is a need to

tissues figure iodine metaiodobenzylguanidine  imibg scintigraphy in the early phase abnormal radioisotope uptake was observed at the dorsal side of the pancreas between the ivc and celiac artery the abnormal uptake clearly persisted in the late phase no abnormal uptake was observed in any other sites whereas the site of the abnormal uptake was not the adrenal gland these findings suggested paraganglioma figure treatment course based on the findings described above a catecholamineproducing primary retroperitoneal tumor occurring between the aorta and vena cava was suspected we planned preoperative treatment with oral administration of an  blocker doxazosin and a  blocker bisoprolol fumarate followed by surgical resection regarding operative procedures because the tumor was located at the dorsal side between the aorta and vena cava we selected laparoscopic surgery using the retroperitoneal approachsurgical findings surgery was performed under general anesthesia with the patient placed in the lateral position with the left side down and rotated from vertical position to slightly the dorsal side ports were placed in the same manner as nephrectomy or adrenalectomy performed via the retroperitoneal approach in our department the mm port for the left hand of the operator was placed at the intersection between the back muscles lumbar quadrate muscle and the th rib at a site apart from this port by the width of  to  fingers the camera port  mm was placed between the th rib and the iliac crest almost on the axillary midline furthermore the port for the right hand of the operator was placed at a site apart from the camera port by the width of  to  fingers and the mm port for the assistant was placed at the cranial side of the port for the right hand of the operator figure  in the same manner as nephrectomy or adrenalectomy performed via the retroperitoneal approach the lateral conical fascia was incised to expose the surgical field and the right adrenal gland and right kidney were detached and resected as a result the tumor was identified figure a as detachment was further advanced the ivc adjacent to the tumor was identified figure b the ivc and the tumor were carefully detached by using dissection forceps figure cd when the ivc and the tumor were detached to some extent the tissue around the tumor was grasped while the anesthesiologist confirmed the absence of marked changes in blood pressure the tumor was laterally pulled to the extent not to damage it figure e and further detached then the aortic wall was identified figure f when the medial side of the tumor was detached to some extent forceps were inserted at its medial side the tumor was pulled laterally and ventrally to create a columnlike surgical field a bundle of tissues containing feeding vessels was gradually detached and resected with a sealing device figure g h to release the tumor figure i there was no apparent drainage vein in this patient after confirmation of the absence of major bleeding at the site of resection figure j and wound closure surgery was completedhistopathological findings macroscopically the tumor measured  cm was yellowish to brownish in color and had a distinct border figure a histologically tumor cells with a large cytoplasm stained as slightly eosinophilic granule by hematoxylineosin staining figure b proliferated in an alveolar form with an abundant capillary network zellballen pattern there was no sign of necrosis increased cell density or apparent vascular invasion the results of both synaptophysin staining figure c and chromogranina staining figure d which are highly specific to paraganglioma were positive in the alveolar area the ki positive rate was less than  the findings appeared to be those of paragangliomapostoperative course the patient started ambulation and oral intake on the day after surgery and was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day  the palpitation detected before surgery disappeared the

reference value  mgday and urinary normetanephrine  mgday reference value  mgdaydiscussionof catecholamineproducing tumors those occurring outside the adrenal gland are referred to as paraganglioma  retroperitoneal tumors are considered to account for  of all tumors  and paraganglioma is considered to account for  to  of retroperitoneal tumors primary retroperitoneal paraganglioma is a relatively rare tumor   while paraganglioma can occur anywhere there are sympathetic ganglia its common sites of occurrence are the head and neck region and the retroperitoneum around the aorta  measurement of catecholamines and their metabolites is useful for diagnosis and ct and magnetic resonance imaging are useful for localization  mibg scintigraphy which is a radioisotope examination has a high sensitivity of  and a high specificity of almost   in our case  imibg scintigraphy showed marked uptake on the other hand there is also a report that fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography was useful for diagnosis in patients negative for mibg  for both pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma surgical resection is considered to be the firstline treatment strategy however in recent years the indications of laparoscopic surgery have been expanded because of rapid advances in the procedure it has also gradually been attempted for these diseases although it has been reported that standard surgical procedures can be applied to tumors with a diameter of  cm or less  no clear indication has been established since paraganglioma often occurs in contact with large vessels as seen in our case there is a risk of damaging large vessels thus laparoscopic surgery of paraganglioma is considered to be more difficult to perform than that for other diseases while we do not have any clear criteria for the indications of the procedure we consider that the indications should be carefully determined since the procedure necessitates strict intraoperative control of blood pressure in addition to preoperative treatment with  blockers and other drugs close cooperation with the departments of endocrinology and anesthesiology is also essential in our case because the tumor was adjacent to the pancreas and portal vein as well as large vessels such as the ivc aorta and celiac artery the magnification effect of laparoscopy was expected to be useful for securing the view of the retroperitoneum and identifying the detachment plane between the tumor and large vessels thus laparoscopic surgery was selected after consultation with the department of gastroenterological surgery we decided to first detach the anterior and posterior surfaces of the tumor which is located at the dorsal side of the ivc as much as possible through the retroperitoneal approach rather than the transperitoneal approach from the beginning if resection was difficult we would switch the retroperitoneal approach to the transperitoneal approach to continue laparoscopic surgery while keeping an option of converting to laparotomy in our case the tumor was located at the dorsal side of the ivc which is difficult to reach in open surgery using either the transperitoneal or translumbar approach however when the right adrenal gland and the right kidney were detached and resected to create a space by the retroperitoneal approach the tumor was identified relatively easily identification of the detachment plane between the tumor and large vessels under magnification of laparoscopy seemed useful for safe tumor resection regarding approaches xu et al  also have reported the efficacy and safety of the retroperitoneal approach meanwhile we have also experienced resection of paraganglioma by laparoscopic surgery using the transperitoneal approach at our department figure  since ct revealed a tumor at the ventral side of the ivc figure a the transperitoneal approach was selected as with nephrectomy and adrenalectomy using the conventional transperitoneal approach displacement of the duodenum allowed us to directly see the tumor between the ivc and aorta and to resect the tumor in a good visual field figure b although there is no established approach for laparoscopic resection of paraganglioma we consider that the approach should comprehensively be determined based on the location of tumors association with adjacent organs skills of surgeons etc there have also been reports of conversion to laparotomy due to difficult detachment from large and renal vessels   for tumors adjacent to large vessels such as the ivc and aorta we consider that surgery should be performed with vascular surgeons standing by in case of damaging large vessels at our hospital we perform surgery for such tumors under such a systemmalignant pheochromocytoma accounts for approximately  to  of pheochromocytoma arising from the adrenal gland whereas malignant paraganglioma accounts for  to  paraganglioma has been reported to be more likely to be malignant than pheochromocytoma   in the  world health organization classification of tumors pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma are assigned with disease codes of malignant tumors because there is no definitive evidence that they should be diagnosed as benign tumors   evaluation of malignancy is recommended even in the absence of apparent metastatic or local invasive lesions at the time of diagnosis the indices of histopathological malignancy include the ki positive rate  as the ki positive rate is  or higher the metastasis rate is considered to be higher however the ki positive rate in our case was less than  the grading system for adrenal pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma gapp which grades  items regarding histological findings and types of catecholamines produced has been reported to be useful for determining malignancy   the gapp scores are calculated for  items regarding pathological findings and one item regarding catecholamine types the total score is considered to correlate with the grade of malignancy the score of our patient was one point because he satisfied only the item of the noradrenalineproducing type he was categorized as having low malignancyfor postoperative followup catecholamines and blood pressure should be measured at  months after surgery and annually thereafter according to the treatment of pheochromocytoma in addition although our patient had a gapp score of one point which indicates low malignancy we consider it necessary to perform imaging studies for a long period of time to monitor for recurrence and metastasis because there is no evidence that the tumor is benignconclusionwe experienced a case of retroperitoneoscopic resection of primary retroperitoneal paraganglioma that occurred between the aorta and vena cava while reports on laparoscopic resection of paraganglioma have still been limited this procedure is considered to be difficult to perform because it is associated with the risk of damaging large vessels however our case suggested that this procedure could safely be performed because of the magnification effect of laparoscopic surgery if the indications were carefully determinedconflict of interest selfdeclaration the authors have no

to the emergency department of our hospital with sudden epigastric pain and vomiting he had a history of endoscopic resection via the retroperitoneal route for a retroperitoneal tumor located in the left diaphragmatic crus at another hospital  months previously xray examination and computed tomography ct revealed inversion of the stomach beyond the diaphragm into the thoracic cavity with the gastroesophageal junction serving as the fulcrum point leading to a diagnosis of postoperative diaphragmatic hernia accompanied by upside down stomach conservative treatment with insertion and placement of a nasogastric tube was performed with the expectation of spontaneous resolution but the event did not resolve spontaneously in addition gastric fluoroscopy showed that the contrast agent was accumulated in the stomach and did not flow from the pylorus to the anal side therefore surgery was scheduled the prolapsed stomach in the thoracic cavity was reduced to the abdominal cavity by laparoscopic surgery the hernia orifice was located adjacent to the esophageal hiatus the hernia orifice was closed with suture and then reinforced with mesh the postoperative course was favorable and the patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day  no recurrence has been observed for the past  years in general the pathological condition of upside down stomach observed in esophageal hiatal hernia may be found in postoperative diaphragmatic hernia laparoscopic surgery for postoperative diaphragmatic hernia exhibiting upside down stomach is considered to be a useful surgical procedure because it can simultaneously confirm the viability of the herniated organs reduce the organs to the abdominal cavity close and reinforce the diaphragmkeywords upside down stomach diaphragmatic hernia laparoscopic surgeryintroductionupside down stomach uds is a rare type of esophageal hiatal hernia accompanied by gastric volvulus which makes the stomach positioned cranial to the esophagogastric junction usually the primary disease is esophageal hiatal hernia and it is extremely rare that uds occurs after surgery of the diaphragmthis paper reports our case of postoperative diaphragmatic hernia with uds which was treated successfully by laparoscopic repair of hernia this case will be described below with some comments based on the relevant literaturecase reporta yearold man suffered from sudden epigastric pain and vomiting because the symptoms persisted he presented to the emergency department of our hospital he had a history of endoscopic resection via the retroperitoneal route for a retroperitoneal tumor located in the left diaphragmatic crus at another hospital  months previously there were accelerated respiration and tachycardia but blood pressure was maintained within the normal range xray examination and computed tomography ct revealed that the stomach was inverted beyond the diaphragm with the gastroesophageal junction serving as the fulcrum point almost the entire stomach was prolapsed into the left thoracic cavity figure   the patient was admitted with a diagnosis of postoperative diaphragmatic hernia accompanied by uds with the expectation that the uds would be released gastric decompression was performed using a nasogastric tube and the clinical course was observed however there was no release of uds and gastric fluoroscopy showed no flow of the contrast agent from the pylorus to the anal side for this reason laparoscopic surgery was performed the patient was in the openleg position with a mm port for camera set in the umbilical region a mm port for the left hand of the operator in the right lateral abdominal region and a mm port for the right hand of the operator in the left lateral abdominal region and a mm port for the assistant in the left hypochondriac region intraperitoneal observation revealed slightly bloody ascites laparoscopic adhesiolysis was performed as much as possible and the prolapsed stomach in the thoracic cavity was reduced the hernia orifice measured    mm and was located in the left diaphragm adjacent to the esophageal hiatus figure  there was no hernia sac indicating pseudohernia and the left lung was visible the hernia orifice was closed tightly with a  nonabsorbable suture then a mesh size of    cm for intraperitoneal placement bard  ventralight st was trimmed to a ushaped structure and fixed with suture around the esophagus to reinforce the diaphragm figure  the clinical course was favorable and the patient was discharged on postoperative day  no recurrence has been observed for  years since thendiscussioneven a single case of postoperative diaphragmatic hernia showing uds was not retrieved from the pubmed database using the key words postoperative diaphragmatic hernia and upside down stomach our case therefore represents the first reported case of such hernia in the world patients with esophageal hiatal hernia showing uds basically have a chronic clinical course and have main complaints of reflux esophagitisrelated anorexia gastrointestinal symptoms such as heartburn and epigastric pain and respiratory symptoms due to compression from the content of hernia often leading to surgery it has been reported that surgery should be performed immediately in such a condition  in our case the patient had an acute course and visited the hospital complaining of respiratory symptoms due to compressionthere is no established treatment for postoperative diaphragmatic hernia showing uds but we considered that treatment similar to that for esophageal hiatal hernia should be performed in other words the stomach with hernia should be returned to the normal anatomical position and the diaphragmatic hernia should be closed with suture and covered with mesh as for surgical approaches the surgical site is likely to be deep and a large incision is required for thoracotomy or laparotomy therefore the use of laparoscopy and thoracoscopy is useful udslaparoscopic surgery for esophageal hiatal hernia with uds has been shown to be superior to open surgery in terms of postoperative complications and length of hospital stay the abdominal and thoracic approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages in comparison with the abdominal approach it is easier with the thoracic approach to perform adhesiolysis when there is adhesion of the content of hernia including the stomach in the thoracic cavity in addition closure with suture is relatively easy because there is a wide surgical space in the thoracic cavity after reduction of the content of hernia on the other hand the abdominal approach is superior to the thoracic approach when detailed examination or resection of the herniated intraabdominal organ is necessaryhernia repairing procedures include the use of mesh as well as reefing of the hernia orifice fundoplication and gastropexy regarding the use of mesh there are many reports documenting that the recurrence rate can be reduced compared to the case without using mesh hashemi et al reported that the recurrence rate was  when laparoscopic surgery was performed for giant esophageal hiatal hernia without using mesh frantzides et al performed a randomized controlled trial of laparoscopic surgery for esophageal hiatal hernia with a hernia orifice   cm and reported that the recurrence rate was significantly improved from  in the nonmesh group to  in the mesh group major complications of mesh include damage to surrounding organs due to mesh esophageal stenosis esophageal mucosal ulcer severe adhesion scarring and infection on the other hand koch et al used composite mesh in  patients and reported that there were no meshrelated complications the use of mesh is not necessary for all cases and selection should be made for individual cases in consideration of the size of the hernia orifice and the fragility of the tissuein esophageal hiatal hernia with uds concurrent reflux esophagitis is often observed and in such cases addition of fundoplication is recommended generally the nissen and toupet methods are selected but the toupet method is reported to be associated with a lower incidence of dysphagia in the early postoperative periodlaparoscopy was selected for our case and mesh usually used for esophageal hiatal hernia was used in addition to closure of the hernia orifice with a nonabsorbable suture the patient developed acute reflux esophagitis at a young age because he usually had no symptoms of reflux esophagitis screening for reflux esophagitis could not be performed by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy therefore no fundoplication was performed and only a part of the gastric wall was fixed by suture to the diaphragm resulting in a favorable clinical coursealthough further accumulation of cases is needed laparoscopic surgery using hernia orifice reefing and mesh is considered to be useful as a means of treating postoperative diaphragmatic hernia

of  and  respectively one recovered to her baseline mrs score of  with the variant of the bilateral paramedian thalamic artery arising from a single p segment the occlusion of the unilateral p segment can be lifethreatening but timely endovascular treatment was effective we believe that the carotid as well as vertebral angiography rather than any vascular images is useful for immediate and reliable diagnosis of the relatively small vascular lesionintroductionparamedian thalamic arteries are perforator branches arising from the p segment of the posterior cerebral artery pca and supply to the paramedian thalamus and the rostral midbrain although overall rate remains unknown in patients with anatomical variants that the paramedian thalamic arteries supplying bilateral paramedian thalamus arise from a single p segment occlusion of the unilateral p segment can cause bilateral paramedian thalamic infarction with or without midbrain involvement in contrast to classic stroke manifestation paramedian thalamic infarction has been well known for exhibiting consciousness impairment from drowsiness to deep coma respiratory dysfunction ophthalmological and neuropshychological signs which were wellknown as top of basilar artery syndrome however if basilar artery occlusion was not observed on vascular images bilateral paramedian thalamic infarction caused by the occlusion of unilateral p segment could be undiagnosed especially in the setting of acute stroke intervention requiring timely diagnosis despite the severe outcome the awareness of both the variant of paramedian thalamic arteries and the clinical presentation of occlusion of such variants is valid for prompt diagnosis and interventionhere we describe the  patients successfully treated with endovascular intervention

monthdiscussionparamedian thalamic arteries supplying the thalamus and hypothalamus with or without midbrain arise from the p segment of the pca percheron described four variants of the paramedian thalamic arteries as follows type i is the most common each perforating arteries arises from bilateral pca type ii a perforating arteries arise directly from a single p segment type ii b truncal perforating artery called the artery of percheron arises from a single p segment type iii several small perforating branches arising from arc bridging the right and left p segments in the patients with type ii a or b variant bilateral paramedian thalamic stroke can be caused by the occlusion of the unilateral p occlusion the patients with the bilateral paramedian thalamic ischemia can often manifest top of basilar artery syndrome such as coma and respiratory distress with or without hemiparesis however if the basilar artery was patent on cta or mra the diagnosis might be misinterpreted by the physicians especially nonneurologists and be delayed and thus only conservative management might be applied in the present  patients all patients manifested deep coma two patients case  and  had respiratory distress and required respiratory support before endovascular intervention one patient case  had bilateral mydriasis therefore albeit the basilar artery was opacified in the patients presenting with top of basilar artery syndrome investigation of the bilateral paramedian thalamic ischemia should be performedin order to evaluate the occlusion of the p segment or bilateral paramedian thalamic artery we performed angiography directly after a noncontrast wholebody including brain ct scan showing no significant findings explaining coma on the basis of a suspicion of occlusion of basilar artery tip during the procedure all the patients underwent vertebral injection followed by carotid injection ipsilateral to the affected p segment before the endovascular treatment since the potential competitive flow between the p and the pcoa might make it difficult to diagnose whether nonopacified p segment on the vertebral injection indicated apparently aplastichypolastic or occlusion of the p segment in case  and  on the basis of the findings of both vertebral and carotid injection the occlusion of the p segment was confirmed in case  although it remained unclear whether the p segment was apparently aplastichypolastic or occlusion on the vertebral injection the smaller caliber of the right pcoa than p segment and the large and funnelshaped left pcoa implied that the right p was originally patent and then acutely occluded therefore when top of basilar syndrome is suspected by clinical symptoms in the setting of an acute ischemic stroke but basilar artery is patent on vertebral injection both the vertebral and the carotid injection were useful for investigation of true occlusion of the p segment from apparently aplastichypolasticmr andor ct angiography may be helpful for detecting the occlusion of the pca involving the p segment however as presented in case  the patient with isolated occlusion of the p segment might have respiratory distress in addition since motion artifact could severely influence for detecting small vasculature such as p segment reliable diagnosis of isolated occlusion of the p segment might be precluded with mr or ct angiographies in the present cases motion artifact caused by the respiratory distress or fluctuating consciousness disturbance might have an impact on diagnosis and treatment planning therefore we believe that a combination of the vertebral and the carotid injections should be performed for detecting the isolated p occlusion as well as the occlusion of pca involving the p segmentas a limitation of the combination angiography since absence of a p segment with ipsilateral fetal type origin of a pca on the vertebral and carotid injections do not prove the absence of the bilateral paramedian ischemia due to the occlusion of the aop its possibility should still attempt to be investigated on the high magnification vertebral angiographyconclusionthree patients with the occlusion of the unilateral p segment arising bilateral paramedian thalamic arteries were successfully treated with the endovascular treatment we believe that a combination of both the vertebral and the carotid injection rather than mr or ct angiography is useful patients for reliable diagnosis and timely interventionreference de la cruzcosme c marquezmartinez m aguilarcuevas r et al percheron

transient embolic material in chronic musculoskeletal pain  and gastrointestinal bleeding from neoplasms however tae using ipmcs for traumatic pseudoaneurysms has not been reported we herein report the first case of a refractory traumatic pseudoaneurysm which could not be embolized with nbca but could be embolized with ipmcs and microspheres without rebleeding this case report has been written following the care consensusbased clinical case reporting guidelinescasea previously healthy yearold man was injured in a traffic accident on arrival his vital signs were as follows blood pressure

necessary to use another embolic material that could be delivered more distallyas a substitute of nbca we selected ipmcs and microsphere embolization of the culprit arteries was performed with ipmcs and microsphere figa figb a suspension of g ipmcs in  ml of contrast medium was prepared and the suspension was stirred first this suspension was injected slowly through a microcatheter placed in the

not present rebleeding and obvious ischemic complications after the final tae followup cect  and  days after tae showed the pseudoaneurysm was completely disappeared figdiscussionthis was the first case report of the tae using ipmcs and microspheres for a traumatic pseudoaneurysm and showed two important clinical issuesfirst ipmcs could be delivered to the refractory pseudoaneurysm with small and tortuous culprit arteries which could not be reached by nbca nbca is considered to be used for small and tortuous arteries however the liquid nature of nbca makes it difficult to control the range of embolization precisely  a previous study reported that embolization might fail due to proximal embolization when nbca could not reach as distal as intended  ipmcs particles in a suspension with contrast medium were reported as small transient embolic material around  to  m  because of its small size and peripheral reachability it was effective and safe to use this material to embolize small culprit arteries for gastrointestinal bleeding from neoplasms  and chronic musculoskeletal pain  tae using ipmcs for a traumatic pseudoaneurysm has not yet been reported because the small particle size of ipmcs made it difficult to stop massive traumatic bleeding in our case the pseudoaneurysm could not be embolized despite multiple procedures of tae because nbca could not be delivered close to the pseudoaneurysm such cases might be applicable of tae of ipmcs although ipmcs was injected from the relatively proximal point of the culprit arteries it could successfully embolize the refractory pseudoaneurysmsecond the injection of microspheres in addition to ipmcs could prevent rebleeding as ipmcs has a temporary effect its embolization of rat renal arteries showed that recanalization occurred within  hours after the procedure  the previous study of gastrointestinal bleeding using ipmcs reported that rebleeding was observed in  of  procedures  therefore we utilized microspheres in addition to ipmcs the efficacy and safety of embolization with microspheres in combination with other embolic materials have been reported in uterine fibroid embolization  as a result in our case the refractory pseudoaneurysm could be embolized without rebleedingin trauma patients with severe tissue injury tae with ipmcs may be useful because of target artery size when tissue is damaged the angiogenesis with a surge of capillary growth occurs to supply adequate oxygen and nutrients to damaged tissue resulting increasing capillary density  in a such situation small capillaries can become the culprit artery of traumatic pseudoaneurysmsin conclusion ipmcs could be delivered to the refractory pseudoaneurysm with small and tortuous culprit arteries which could not be reached by nbca furthermore the injection of microspheres in addition to ipmcs could embolize such pseudoaneurysm without rebleeding further reports should be accumulated to determine other cases where ipmcs and

resistance gene mutation hashimotos thyroiditisintroductionthyroid hormone resistance syndrome thrs is characterized by reduced sensitivity of target organs or tissues to thyroid hormones the patients thyroid function can be manifested by increased levels of circulating thyroid hormones whereas serum concentration of thyroid stimulating hormone tsh is normal or slightly elevated most patients may simply have elevated blood thyroid hormone with no obvious clinical manifestations but some can exhibit symptoms of hyperthyroidism hypothyroidism or nontoxic goiter it is a rare disease with an incidence of   to  this disease has a genetic predisposition however a few cases are sporadic the main cause of this disease is thyroid hormone receptor deficiency due to gene mutation which can be autosomal dominant or occasionally in recessive inheritance since resistance to thyroid hormone was firstly observed in  by refetoff et al more than  cases originating from over  families had been reported most cases about  are caused by mutations in the thyroid receptor  gene on chromosome  while other cases are caused by mutations in the thyroid receptor  gene located on the chromosome  or genes related to the transport or metabolism of thyroid hormone current studies have shown that the mutation sites of thr gene are predominantly located in exons  to  however in this study we present a pediatric female patient with thrs harboring a novel mutation site in the exon  of thr gene and concomitant hashimotos thyroiditis ht we also review the current literature about the relationship of thr and autoimmune thyroid diseasecase presentationprobandthe proband a yearold chinese girl was admitted to endocrinology department of capital medical university affiliated beijing luhe hospital for

and comprehensive physical examination we found that this patient had no clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism such as tachycardia or palpitations heat intolerance or excessive sweating fatigue tremors sensitivity to the cold or unusual bowel habits etc her body weight did not change obviously during the half year additionally the girl was born fullterm weighing  kg having

with ht gene sequencing was performed to confirm this suspicion the results of sequencing revealed a new point mutation in the th exon of the thr gene c  ga this mutation caused the conversion of glutamic acid to lysine at position  p glulys thus she was diagnosed with thrs based on genetic analysis and no medication was given a low dose of levothyroxine sodium was given to control the goiter during followup thyroid function was stable with no evidence of worsening thyrotoxicosis and there was no significant change in goitertable  thyroid function and thyroid autoantibody tests of the

d partial sequencing results of exon  for the thr gene the arrows indicate the mutation site in the th exon of the thr gene c  gadiscussionthyroid hormone resistance syndrome thrs is a disorder characterized by low response to thyroid hormone due to mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor gene there are two subtypes of human thyroid hormone receptor thr and thr each subtype has different isoforms such as thr thr thr thr and thr  these receptors have specific organ distribution characteristics additionally genetic defects involving th cell transport and metabolism were also reported broadening our understanding of impaired th sensitivity all these features determine the diversity of clinical manifestations of thrs according to clinical manifestations thrs can be divided into three categories global resistance grth pituitary resistance prth and peripheral resistance prrth to thyroid hormone grth who represent the majority of patients have no distinctive manifestations except for goiter patients with prth mainly experience mild to moderate hyperthyroidism without ophthalmopathy and pretibial myxedema prrth may cause symptoms or signs of hypothyroidism the multiplicity of symptoms with not typical model makes this disease difficult to diagnose till now gene sequencing is considered as the gold standard for diagnosing thrsto date numerous mutations have been identified  of the mutations are located in the thrgene which consists of  exons most studies about thr gene mutation have revealed that mutations often occur in three hotspot regions between exons  and  located at codons   and  only a few cases reported that the mutation site can locate at codons  which is called the cold region point mutations are prevalent causing missense mutations while insertion mutations and deletion mutations are relatively rare  in this report the proband had no distinctive manifestations except for goiter thyroid function showed increased levels of circulating thyroid hormones with normal tsh concentration gene sequencing revealed a new point mutation in the th exon of the thr gene c  ga  a comprehensive examination was conducted on the probands pedigree we found out that her father had the same thyroid function and gene mutation site thus she was diagnosed with thrs due to a new point mutation in the th exon of the thr gene c  ga for this patient with thrs elevated thyroid hormones can compensate for hormone resistance in some degree and she had no clinical manifestations except for goiter we did not give her any treatmentin this pedigree report we found out that both the proband and her father were positive for thyroglobulin antibodies and thyroid peroxidase antibodies early in  gavin et al proposed a causal link between thyroid hormone resistance and primary autoimmune hypothyroidism they claimed that chronic tsh elevation in rth stimulates lymphocytes to produce the proinflammatory cytokine tnfalpha and tnfalpha mediates thyroid cell destruction by binding to its receptors on thyrocytes or indirectly by potentiating antibody formation although a number of cases have reported diagnosis of ht in patients with thrs   it is still debated whether ht is more prevalent in thrs or just coexist in the same individual by coincidence current researches have shown that both ht and thrs have certain genetic tendency combined with the above theory and this pedigree report we have the reason to believe that thrs increases the risk of ht thus in future we should focus on the incidence of ht in thrs patients and also we need to figure out the pathogenesisin conclusion thrs have no specific clinical features most of them have normal growth and present only with goiter altogether high th levels which makes diagnosing this disease difficult till now gene sequencing is considered as the gold standard for diagnosing thrs furthermore treatment should be individualized to control the patients symptoms rather than normalize the elevated th levels the advances in our knowledge about thrs raise novel questions about whether thrs are prone to th further studies need to explore the relationship between the two

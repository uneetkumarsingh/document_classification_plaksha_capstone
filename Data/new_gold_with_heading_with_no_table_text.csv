Others,ASAA_36.docx,Other,ASAA_36.docx,although standard treatments have been globally established for autoimmune hepatitis aih and primary biliary cholangitis pbc unmet needs in terms of treatment still remain for both disorders corticosteroids and azathioprine are officially approved for aih while intolerance due to a variety of adverse effects and incomplete response to these drugs clearly indicate novel therapeutic options for aih among other general immunosuppressive agents mycophenolate mofetil is a promising alternative because of excellent efficacy and better safety profile ianalumab antibcell activating factor receptor is another promising agent for aih and clinical trial is ongoing globally for patients with pbc who exhibit incomplete response to ursodeoxycholic acid udca about  of the whole farnesoid x receptor fxr agonists and fibrates are the most promising agents obeticholic acid a firstinclass fxr agonist was officially approved for pbc in the united states canada and european countries the longterm efficacy of a combination therapy of udca and bezafibrate was recently demonstrated in japan other fxr agonists and fibrates are under clinical trials although pbc is an autoimmune disease clinical trials of immunosuppressants and agents targeting to immunological key molecules have repeatedly failed the reason of this is believed that immunological attack against biliary epithelial cells had already occurred in very early phase of the disease and chronic cholestasis resulting in fibrosis is a main pathological feature of the patients with pbc in daily clinical practice  currently no drug including udca has been proved to be effective for primary sclerosing cholangitis psc and evidencebased therapeutic regimens are strongly awaited because pbc and psc partly shares its pathogenesis as chronic cholestatic disease fxr agonists and fibrates are also attracting attentions from researchers as well as pharmaceutical companies a secondgeneration nonsteroidal fxr agonist cilofexor stays ahead in a race a phase  clinical trial of cilofexor has been already launched and hopefully this drug will be the first drug which successfully demonstrates the efficacy and safety for psc in the near future besides the strong relationship of psc with inflammatory bowel diseases has suggested the huge impact of gut flora on pathogenesis of psc and particular pathogenic species in the gut may be involved with psc in this regard treatment with antibiotics is another candidate for novel treatment for psc although standard treatments have been globally established for autoimmune hepatitis aih and primary biliary cholangitis pbc a number of unmet needs in terms of treatment still remain for both disorders pbc is an autoimmune disease in which biliary epithelial cells are targeted by immune cells however clinical trials with immunosuppressive drugs and agents targeting immunological molecules have repeatedly failed presumably because immunological attack against biliary epithelial cells had already occurred in very early phase of the disease and chronic cholestasis resulting in fibrosis is a main pathological feature of the patients with pbc in the daily clinical practice thus drugs relieving chronic intrahepatic cholestasis are effective and ursodeoxycholic acid udca is officially approved and currently used as a firstline drug for patients with incomplete response to udca about  of the whole patients farnesoid x receptor fxr agonists and fibrates are the most promising agents obeticholic acid a firstinclass fxr agonist was officially approved in the us canada and european countries the longterm efficacy of a combination of udca and bezafibrate was recently demonstrated in japan other fxr agonists and fibrates are under clinical trialscorticosteroids and a combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine is a standard treatment regimen for aih and most of patients respond very well to these treatment regimens however development of a variety of adverse effects aes is a common feature of these drugs especially corticosteroids for instance patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or severe osteoporosis are intolerant to corticosteroids moreover it is not uncommon that elevation of transaminases sometimes occurs along with tapering of corticosteroids strongly indicating refractory to corticosteroids coadministration of azathioprine is strongly advisable for these cases intolerant or refractory to corticosteroids while development of severe aes due to azathioprine is predictable by testing of nudt polymorphism other aes could occur even in cases with safer nudt polymorphisms in this situation other immunosuppressive drugs such as mycophenolate mofetil mmf cyclosporine and tacrolimus are chosen among them mmf seems to be the most promising the easl guidelines for aih suggest mmf is an alternative choice in patients intolerant or refractory to standard treatment in our experiences in japan mmf is associated with prompt reduction of transaminases and reduction of corticosteroids and has a good safety profile another agent that is under development is ianalumab targeting bcell activating factor receptor baffr and clinical trial for aih is currently ongoing,

this paper reports an experimental and numerical study of the flame structure and reaction analysis of an nhhair turbulent diffusion flame numerical simulations are performed using a rans approach and comparing three different numerical schemes creck was found to perform better than okafor and gri a nox analysis was also performed revealing the location of the nox formationalthough the experimental results are interesting the proposed modelling strategy is not reliable rans modelling is considered too limited to correctly reproduce such complex flames which are expected to be highly impacted by turbulent mixing and differential diffusion moreover no real validation is proposed by the authors other than the plots shown in fig  where none of the proposed simulations seem to correctly capture the experimental pointsconsidering that most of the study is based on numerical predictions i cannot recommend this paper for oral presentation in a symposiumans in addition to fig  the flame length when the gas temperature distribution in the radial direction and flow velocity were changed has already been compared between the calculation and experimental results in many experimentsa please refer to the minutes of the international symposiuma in this manuscript the reference is indicated as  the experimental results agreed very well with the calculation results therefore we have been examining the formation of nox with a certain degree of calculation accuracy this study examined the reaction mechanism not only based on numerical calculations but also based on experimental validationa b because there was a character limit due to the writing guidelines many schematic diagrams of the experiment could not be inserted into this manuscript therefore misunderstandings might arise a certain number of pages can be secured due to the reviewers request so further experimental results can be added to this manuscripty okumura et al st international symposium on transport phenomena istp numerical simulation of ammonia burner with hydrogen flame stabilizer paper no  pages  ref no  in manuscriptn matsudat tsubotay okumurat horif akamatsu a consideration on lownox burner for coaxial ammoniajet flame arrangement of nox reduction area by duplex tubes for the design of lownox burner th symposium japanese on combustion no p  pagesreviewer  though a substantial amount of efforts had been expensed on this work it is regrettable that this paper does not produced much useful insights into the complex processes governing the stability and emissions of hydrogenammoniaair flames that the use of a more complete chemical kinetics scheme improves the prediction of flame properties especially in cases of highly diffusive hydrogen flame system is a foregone conclusion performing a set of computations to prove this point is unproductive moreover in the current study the best scheme did not produce even a satisfactory facsimile of the centerline temperature and species profiles this calls question to the justification for the authors to conduct an elaborate exposition of the chemical pathways of nox formation in this complex flame would it be better to conduct an analysis after achieving a more satisfactory simulation of the flame and flow structuresthe contribution of this type of study to advancing knowledge for technology development is dubious the flame configuration itself is problematic this setup of a coflow jet diffusion flame is in essence a hydrogen jet flame doped with a lesser amount of ammonia volumetric flow rate of hydrogen was set to more than three times that of ammonia at such high percentage of highly reactive pure hydrogen next to air it is not surprising that the coflow velocity can be increased to  ms incidentally what is the significance of air velocity of  mssolving the flame stability and emissions problems of burning ammonia in practical systems is very challenging it requires extensive and methodical laboratory studies to identify the appropriate burner and combustor configurations to achieve performance and emissions goals studies using idealized flame configurations such as the current one can be useful only if they address specific issues it is unclear which specific issue this study has addressedans in research on nhh a new fuel the comparison of experimental and calculation results in a turbulent flow field cannot be said nonproductive the flame structure regarding nhh in a turbulent flow field has not been analyzed yet and this study has indicated the consistency between experimental and calculation results for the first time the numerical calculation of a hydrocarbon fuel has been studied for approximately  years however research on nhh has just begun therefore many papers of research on ammonia basic research conducted by kobayashi et al and hayakawa et al have been published in proci  the mane of proceedings since around  until recent years from this point research on nhh is in the development stage in the world therefore it is considered important to show a scheme which is thought to be the best at present and its accuracy in flame research using a burner as shown below the differences in the centerline temperature and species profiles between the experimental and calculation results are not so large as the reviewer pointed outit is expected that the best scheme at present will be improved further and calculation results obtained using the improved scheme can accurately agree with experimental results although the scheme is in the development stage at present the social role of proci  the mane of proceedings is to widely propagate and discuss the scheme as you already know ammonia does not burn in the form of a simple substance and the calorific value of ammonia is approximately half that of methane therefore the combustion of ammonia is assisted by hydrogen however the calorific value of hydrogen is approximately onethird that of methane to obtain the calorific value of a hydrocarbon fuel using hydrogen and ammonia the blow rate of hydrogen and ammonia must be increased namely highintensity combustion must be realized to realize highintensity combustion a burner to generate a turbulent flow is indispensable in this manuscript  ms is an example of measuring the threshold value of air velocity when the burner is used and this value can be used as an index for highintensity combustion in this study nobody knew how long this value could be maintained when the air velocity exceeded  ms the ammonia flame could not be maintained what is the reason why it is not surprising that the coflow velocity can be increased to  ms in japan some companies have been developing an ammonia burner using a duplex tube this paper can sufficiently give technical knowledge to these companies reviewerdear authors of the manuscript flame structure and reaction analysis for ammonia turbulent burner with hydrogen flame stabilizeralthough the general topic of the manuscript is timely and relevant for the combustion community and a couple of methodological ideas presented in the paper are interesting in general the way the paper is written and results presented is far from satisfactory therefore i rate the present work as reject and provide few specific comments below that could be useful to the authors to improve their work for a future submissionreply for comment in general the use of the english language is rather poor throughout the manuscript to the extent that several points that the authors extract from the results are unclear the english used in the paper needs to be significantly improved if the authors would like to publish this paper in pci or elsewhereans the english language of this manuscript will be improved after proofreading by native speakers  also it is not clear what is the main aim of the paper if it is validation of the numerical results this should be clearly stated and a comprehensive validation presented alternatively if the aim of the authors was to demonstrate that flame anchoring for a hydrogenpiloted ammonia nonpremixed flame then this is discussed to an unsatisfactory extent in other words in my view the authors had the possibility to perform an interesting study focusing on model validation or flame stabilizationemissions but in the end they did neither to a satisfactory extentans the authors have been studying an ammonia turbulent burner with a hydrogen flame stabilizer focusing on the refinement of a model and nox emissions using the refined model because there was a character limit due to the writing guidelines the vilification of numerical analysis could not be inserted into this paper however the vilification of numerical analysis was sufficiently reported in reference  in response to the reviewers request in this process the experimental results and discussion of the reaction mechanism can be added to this manuscript therefore the indicated matters are added to this manuscript research on nhh a new fuel is in the development stage in the world and the scheme is also in the development stage at present under such circumstances if results obtained using a hydrocarbon fuel are not similar to those obtained using nhh the former results are insufficient to be published in other words if calculation results obtained using the scheme do not accurately agree with experimental results the publication of the calculation results is worthless if so the history of technology is in vain emergent technology can be advanced by the publication of study results from various aspects  in section  the numerical solver and its characteristics should be described in much more detail the authors mention a chen model but explanation nor reference is providedans in supplemental material s the content of the chen model and the reason for using it were already described a reference related to the chen model will be added to the text of this manuscript ys chen sw kim computation of turbulent flows using an extended k turbulence closure model nasa contractor report cr pp   significant focus is dedicated to the comparison between predictions from three chemical kinetics scheme but such comparisons are more efficiently performed in d and d calculations cantera and it is in general not necessary to do that again in d or d calculations what is the reason for repeating the comparison in the rans calculations the main conclusions about the accuracy of the different mechanisms as it appears could be already deducted from the d calculationsans at present many basic studies on ammonia only calculate d and d these studies should be expanded to research on combustors by only d and d calculations useful information on the applicability of ammonia to a turbulent flow field and the design of a burner cannot be obtained for many studies in which d calculation is only performed it is extremely important to elucidate the formation and reduction zones of nox in a threedimensional space  the comparison of the numerical and experimental results presented in figure  is not satisfactory and far from publication quality why not directly superimpose experimental data to numerical results the same is true for figures  in which the different line thicknesses that the authors use are very difficult to read and understandans if the experimental data are directly superimposed to the numerical results in figure  this figure will be difficult to understand without magnifying it when we magnified this figure the pages of this manuscript exceeded the page limit although an example of the comparison is exhibited below the comparison of the numerical and experimental results presented in figure  is not satisfactory and far from publication quality is considered excessively subjective  the authors propose a method to separate thermal and fuel nox based on marking of the nitrogen but it is unclear how this is implemented the description provided by the authors in section  is not satisfactory nor detailed enough ie how many extra species are needed to apply the method a large number i suspect what is the advantage of the method proposed compared to other and more conventional methods based on sensitivity analysis and chemical reaction pathwaysans have you read supplemental material s in this material additional reaction formulae and methods and calculation methods are described in detail in addition the law of conservation of mass can be valid even if thermal and fuel nox are separated because two fuel types are used and the ammonia flame is stabilized by hydrogen the formation routes of the two types of nox greatly differ from each other according to the place space in the future to reduce the amount of nox emissions it is extremely important to elucidate the origins of nox and the spatial distribution of radicals involved in nox i disagree with the affirmation of until the accurate calculation of a hydrocarbon fuel can be attained the publication of this study should be restrained although it takes  years to improve the calculation accuracy of a hydrocarbon fuel the calculation of nhh a new fuel has been in the development stage at present the scheme is also in the development stage under such circumstances the analysis of a phenomenon similar to that obtained using an actual burner in conjunction with the highly accurate scheme began and the calculation results were compared with the experimental results for the first time are these efforts worthless as the reviewer says from the perspectives of the history of technological development and the decarbonized society toward  we want the reviewers to comprehensively judge this manuscript in addition it is questionable whether reviewer has read the supplemental document the two copies of which were already submitted the reject of reviewer in  above is wrong because the reject is based on the reviewers personal satisfaction and subjective criteria , reply for the reviewer comment  title of the paper no procid  thank you very much for your detailed feedback   reply for comment   reply

Research paper_Journal article,AYXWS_3_13.docx,Research paper_Journal article,AYXWS_3_13.docx,changes in parental involvement and perceptions in parents of young children during the covid pandemicthe purpose of this study was to clarify changes in parental involvement with their children and parental perceptions related to parenting in both fathers and mothers of young children during the covid pandemic this study used a crosssectional observational design data were collected using a webbased questionnaire with  fathers and  mothers between october  and november   parents answered questions regarding themselves basic sociodemographic variables such perceived changes in involvement with their children the presence or absence of abusive behavior eg violence toward children and parental perceptions related to parenting many parents indicated that their involvement or perceptions did not experience major changes compared to before the first wave of the covid pandemic fifty percents of the fathers considered themselves to be more physical contact or communication with their children and there was a significant difference between fathers and mothers regarding eating meals with their children p   meanwhile fathers felt tired due to parenting  or did not have enough free time  during the covid pandemic while mothers who responded that their partners took care of their children were significantly more than fathers p   mothers who answered that they could not interact with children because of overburdened were significantly more than fathers p   during the same period we recommend that family support workers help fathers maintain their involvement with their young children without heavy stress and support mothers to reduce their heavy burden of parenting continuously this would contribute to young childrens healthy growth and development despite a public health crisisthe coronavirus disease  covid has wrought havoc worldwide every government implemented measures to prevent covids spread in japan the government announced the first state of emergency on april   and later issued it several times in areas with many patients with covid the japanese government did not carry out a lockdown like other countries but tackled covids spread through defensive measures such as recommendations to avoid the three cs which are closed spaces crowded places and closecontact settings the government also recommended staying at home to limit the flow of people and reduce the spread of the virus although these measures did not have legal force social systems have changed in various ways in response to the recommendations requiring people to drastically change their lifestyle and adapt some people were able to adapt to changes well while others did not if we consider the change in parents lifestyles and interactions with children adaptive parents increased their time at home smoothly and shared parenting and household chores among each other  on the other hand some parents householdrelated burdens or parenting stress increased by staying at home  previous studies on parents lifestyles during the covid pandemic in other countries have reported similar trends many parents mostly mothers experienced difficult adjustments in dividing time between parenting and work heavy responsibility for additional household chores and parenting or isolation under lockdown  we should pay attention to the harmful effects on parents who could not adapt to changes after the covid pandemic they also have some mental health problems such as high levels of anxiety depressive symptoms and parenting stress  sometimes parenting burden or parental mental health problems have a negative effect on parents involvement with their children and perceptions related to parenting in fact previous studies have reported that tiredness caused by parenting burden increases parental negative emotions toward parenting and parents who have suffered health losses display a negative attitude toward their children  however there is a lack of studies regarding changes in parental involvement and perceptions during the covid pandemicthe covid pandemic has imposed many limits on young children and their parents in japan many institutions restricted young children and their parents to utility time or the number of users was restricted to avoid the three cs the number of parents who did not admit their children in day nurseries or undergo medical examinations also increased in order to prevent coronavirus infections  as a result contact between parents and family support workers decreased in other words not only did parents lose opportunities to seek support regarding matters relating to parenting or their children but it also became difficult for family support workers to understand the conditions of parents and their children after the pandemic timely support for parents became difficult when they faced parenting problems it can be considered that a lack of parental support leads to inappropriate parenting in fact previous study reported that some parents felt that their psychological or social resourses were fewer than before the covid pandemic  young children tend to become targets of inappropriate parenting and are more susceptible to abuse than older children before the covid pandemic  however there is also a lack of studies focusing on parents of young children after the covid pandemicwe consider that it is necessary for family support workers to be mindful of the changes in parenting due to the covid pandemic and to provide additional support to parents this study aimed to clarify changes in parental involvement with their children and perceptions related to parenting by fathers and mothers of young children during the covid pandemic based on the results of this study we suggest ways in which can be provided to fathers and mothersthis study used a crosssectional observational design we conducted a webbased questionnaire survey in tokyo in this study young children were defined as those aged six years old or less we included parents whose children used institutions to cooperate in this study parents who could not read and answer the questionnaire written in japanese or did not agree to participate in this study were excluded a request to participate in this study was sent to parents as part of a larger multisite study examining the daily lives of young children and parents after the covd pandemic began the final participants of this study were  parents  fathers and  mothers parents answered questions regarding their parents age family structure years of education employment status annual household income childrens age childrens sex and the number of children in the family we explored two topics about parents involvement with their young children during the covid pandemic using a questionnaire that was created for this study based on previous studies  the topics were perceived changes in interactions and the presence or absence of abusive behaviors toward young children compared to before the covid pandemic parental abusive behavior is defined as any parental behavior that harms children such as being physically violent toward a child or rejecting a child regarding perceived changes in the frequency of interactions compared to before the covid pandemic parents were asked the following about their interactions with their children daily care playing physical contact communication and eating a meal using a fivepoint likerttype scale ranging from decreased very much  to increased very much  parental abusive behavior was assessed using five items of parental performance punching or kicking shouting emotionally cursing or threatening parental neglect and ignoring children participants chose the most closely applied answer regarding abusive behavior from four possible choices doing before but not after the pandemic not doing before but doing after the pandemic not doing both before and after the pandemic or doing both before and after the pandemicwe explored parental perceptions related to parenting during the covid pandemic using a questionnaire created for this study based on previous studies  respondents answered the following seven questions a i feel that my family bonds are strong b i enjoy interaction with my children c i feel pleasure in my childrens growth d i feel my partner takes care of the children e i feel tired due to parenting f i do not have enough free time and g i cannot interact with children because i am overburdened parents responded on a fivepoint likerttype scale ranging from strongly disagree  to strongly agree  we sent letters with written requests for cooperation in this study to  nursery schools six kindergartens and three childcare support centers in one city in tokyo we explained the contents of this study to the managers or staff of these institutions who agreed to cooperate with this study before data collection we requested that the institutions inform only parents who had children aged six years or younger information for inviting parents to participate in this study was provided by the managers or staff participants were recruited between october st and november   when the second wave of covid subsided in japan the online questionnaire was shared with participants during the same period the opening page of the online questionnaire explained the study including the purpose methods voluntary participation anonymity and contact information categorical variables were presented as numbers and percentages and continuous variables as mean and standard deviation sd we conducted the following analyses to explore statistical differences between fathers and mothers a categorical variables were tested using the chisquare test or fishers exact test and b parental years of education were examined using the mannwhitney u test we conducted a residual analysis to explore which cells contributed to the significant association if we found significant differences using the chisquare test or fishers exact test in the three groups usually adjusted residuals of  and  indicate p   and p   respectively we used to assess the normality of distribution of continuous variables shapirowilk testwe focused on parents who changed their abusive behavior before and after the covid pandemic we conducted the mcnemar test to explore the statistical differences in the presence or absence of abusive behavior before and after the pandemicwe summarized several responses to control variables as follows a the responses for perceived changes of interactions frequency were increase static or decrease and b the responses for perceived changes of parental perceptions were agree static or disagree to calculate the appropriate sample size for comparison between two groups we set up as follows a effect size was  b level of significance was  c statistical power was  we estimated the rate of data unavailability at   eventually we would need to enroll  parents for each groups we conducted data analysis after excluding data items with missing values twotailed pvalues less than  were considered at significant the analysis was conducted using the ibm spss statistics ver  and r version  the study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the national center for global health and medicine approval no ncgmg before data collection an anonymous survey was conducted we confirmed the consent of the participants in this study using a checkmark placed by the participant in the confirmation box which indicated the consent of the participanttable  shows the demographic data of the participants the average number of years was  sd  in fathers and  sd  in mothers the average age of the children was  sd  in fathers and  sd  in mothers and the ratio of boys to girls was one to one for both fathers and mothers there was no significant difference between fathers and mothers in terms of demographic data excluding years of education p   and employment status p   most participants had a middletohigh socioeconomic statusin table  we report the perceptions of changes in interaction frequency compared to before the covid pandemic there was a significant difference between parents regarding eating with children p   fathers eat meals with children more often than before the covid pandemictable  illustrates the perceived changes in the presence or absence of parental abusive behavior before and after the covid pandemic there were no significant differences in abusive behavior between fathers and mothers table  depicts the changes in parental perceptions related to parenting compared to before the first wave of the covid pandemic in japan there were significant differences between parents regarding partners parenting p   and being overburdened p   mothers indicated that fathers took part in parenting more than before covid and they were overburdened by parenting during the covid pandemic this study was conducted to clarify changes in parental involvement and perceptions of parents of young children during the covid pandemic using a webbased questionnaire many parents indicated that their involvement with their children or their perceptions related to parenting did not substantially change as a result of the pandemic some fathers felt more involved with their children and tired due to parenting or did not have enough free time during the covid pandemic some mothers perceived parenting negatively during the same period because they were overburdened parents tiredness and distress can not only increase the risk of inadequate parenting or parental burnout but also negatively effect wellbeing of parents and their children  therefore we recommend that family support workers help fathers maintain their involvement with their young children without heavy stress and support mothers to reduce their heavy burden due to continuous parentingmost fathers answered that they did not feel any changes regarding their involvement with their young children or their perceptions of parenting rather the paternal frequency of interactions with their young children increased more than that of mothers this finding is similar to that of previous studies  in particular regarding eating meals with their children there was a significant difference between fathers and mothers this suggests that some fathers may have adapted well to the changes during the covid pandemic due to a shift in their lifestyle such as eating at the same time as their young children moreover  of the fathers agreed that their physical contact or communication with their children increased we considered that changes in paternal lifestyle due to the covid pandemic increased positive fatherchild interactions in addition twofifths of the fathers reported that they enjoyed interacting with their children  and felt pleasure in their childrens growth  in other words some fathers had positive parenting experiences during the covid pandemic parents positive emotions towards their children can help relieve stress and moderate negative experience for both parents and children  previous study also reported that more fathers were involved with their children and more childrens emotional wellbeing increased during the covid pandemic  therefore it is important for fathers to receive support to maintain their positive involvement with their children as well as childrens healthy growththere is a risk that an exponential increase in the amount of parenting that is required can cause parents to experience negative emotions toward parenting parental burnout or abusive behavior toward their children in fact many international agencies such as the world health organization warned that children and their families were at risk due to increased parenting stress and violence against children during the covid pandemic  in this study onethird of fathers reported feeling tired due to parenting  or did not have enough free time  tiredness and dissatisfaction with free time can easily trigger negative emotions toward parenting or parental burnout  moreover parents often take responsibility for parenting and their job in parallel at home during the covid pandemic fathers need to draw boundaries between parenting and their work with good balanced but it is not easy for fathers to do because fathers are inexperienced at balanceing between parenting and their work and may not have efficient strategies unlike mothers  thus it is important to support fathers so that paternal involvement does not turn into heavy parenting burdensmothers who answered that their frequency of daily care for children decreased was much fewer than mothers who answered that their frequency increased or remained static in other words mothers still had an increased parenting responsibility during the covid pandemic this finding may complement previous studies  burden of households or parenting inescapably increases due to staying at home and it is likely to be borne mainly by mothers as a result maternal parenting did not reduce even if fathers had cooperated more than they did before the covid pandemic additionally more than half of the mothers were employed and approximately  agreed that they felt tired due to parenting or could not interact with their children because they were overburdened caregivers often adjust their time or work according to their familys needs and consequently they can experience more workrelated adjustments and pressure compared to before the lockdown  all of which can lead to exhaustion the longer the covid pandemic continues the higher risk of developing maternal mental health problems or burnout maternal mental health problems or burnout can lead to maternal abusive behavior toward children and mental health problems in children  in fact some mothers answered that they displayed abusive behavior toward their children after the covid pandemic even though they did not before the pandemic therefore we recommend that support for mothers be provided urgently based on the findings of this study we have identified some implications for practice we recommend that the support provided by family support workers to both fathers and mothers should reflect the following changes in parenting that resulted from the covid pandemic some fathers felt tired because of parenting or did not have enough free time previous studies reported that paternal resilience were associated with parentchild relationships closeness or parents who had good parentchild relationships reduced parental burnout scores during the covid pandemic in other words it may be possible to lighten paternal burden of parenting due to help fathers have good parentchild relationships family support workers should assess fatherchild relationships and provide appropriate support for fathers  moreover a previous study showed that fathers who had good relationships with other fathers during the covid pandemic felt that this had a positive impact on their mental health  therefore it is also important to help fathers find opportunities for recreational activities during parenting family support workers should provide fathers with the opportunity to interact with peers in line with current covid measures and policies such as online or outdoor meetings to maintain involvement with their young children without negative emotions toward parenting some mothers felt tired due to parenting or could not interact with children because they were overburdened therefore family support workers should provide mothers with support to reduce their heavy burden of parenting continuously mothers have lost the opportunity to seek support to prevent coronavirus infections it is pointed out that limited access to social support can lead to parental burnout ot inadequate parenting behaviour  we recommend that family support workers develop a new approach to parenting support that mothers can easily receive support without worrying about being infected with covid family support workers may also provide parenting support services using online platforms wherein mothers can consult with family support workers about parenting concurrently it is important to train specialists in parenting support because sufficient staffing is even more necessary to help mothers than it was before the covid pandemic this will facilitate healthy parenting healthy growth in children and a healthy adjustment to the covid crisis the results should be interpreted carefully owing to the lack of sufficient sample size in a limited zone and the imbalance between the number of fathers and mothers perhaps parents especially fathers had a high level of interest in parenting this study is based on parental selfevaluation and some answers may differ from actual situations the possibility of recall bias cannot be excluded regarding the items to be asked compared to before the covid pandemic future studies should use larger sample sizes and include parents from various backgrounds additionally future studies should objectively evaluate parental perceptions and involvement with young children and conduct longitudinal observations because it can change over time during the covid pandemic  approximately half of the fathers experienced positive changes in parenting while approximately  of mothers experienced negative changes it is suggested that family support workers should provide support for parenting by both fathers and mothers this would contribute to young childrens healthy growth and development despite a public health crisisthis work was supported by national college of nursing japan we are grateful to the

Response to reviewer comments,BEMOT_7.docx,Response to reviewer comments,BEMOT_7.docx,thank you for giving me the opportunity to rereview the manuscript the revised manuscript has been substantially improved i think the important concern that the proposal of this study could be misinterpreted to readers would have been resolved the authors described the detailed proportion of subjects in patients and their family group in table  and that the response rate would be low in the study limits of the discussion section in addition it was made changes wholly regarding overstatement of the data interpretation in the manuscript therefore i think the revised manuscript was attempted to allow readers to conduct valid assessment of the research results i recommend it for acceptance after implementing a few suggestions mentioned in the comments to be sent to the authorsthe revised manuscript has been considerably improved however i think the authors should address the following some issues in the revised manuscript the authors added the information regarding the respondents of the pt group in table along with that it should be described the corresponding questionnaire item in questionnaire of the supplementary information in the revised manuscript the authors added the information about the videos in the materials and methods section as followsthe contents of the videos comprised an overview of genome editing technology including genome terminology and basic methods and an objective description of documented benefits and risks of the technology in japanese each video was viewed through the web survey system and were  minutes and  minutes in duration respectively the participants were asked to watch these videos prior to completing section  and section  prior to full implementation the questionnaire and videos were pilot tested among representatives of the gp pt and hcp populations to confirm that the information was objectively presented without potentially biasing the responses and whether any expressions were difficult to understand page  lines i think the authors should describe about the video more detail regarding the description of documented benefits and risks because these are possible to affect the responses of the respondents if the documented benefits and risks were referred from the previous reports the authors should cite the corresponding references otherwise the authors should show the detailed description in the manuscript furthermore the authors should mention how they evaluated objectiveness and bias of the videos in the pilot tests the authors commented about the reason that they have not been conducted any statistical analysis as followsour deliberate intention was not to pursue detailed statistical analysis in this study due to concerns about the appropriateness of hypothesis testing across groups intentionally selected to represent different sectors of society instead our primary goal was to provide a description of attitudes across stakeholders and make qualitative interpretations the intention was to contribute to future policy discussions by describing attitudes by group and noting potential differences and it does not place importance on clarifying statistical relationships through hypothesis testing questionnaire items were designed to assess the attitude of the participants about various situations a statistical test for all of these may not be desirable from the point of view of multiplicity in light of this we agree with the reviewer that care needs to be taken regarding the interpretation therefore the wording on these points has been revised to avoid overstatementi think the statistical analysis is desirable in this study because the authors deal with the comparison among stakeholders in regarding to multiplicity issues caused by multiple statistical tests a way for adjustment could be considered however i understand that this study would be an exploratory study i think the authors would be better to describe about the position of this study not only in this comment but also in the manuscript it would also be considered to describe that the analysis is the next step of the study as a study limitation in the discussion section, dear prof kosho  to the authors       it might be correctly hcp  to  page  line 
Research paper_Journal article,BVQDS_1.docx,Response to reviewer comments,BVQDS_1.docx,percutaneous sclerotherapy with ok for lymphocele afterpelvic or paraaortic lymphadenectomy preliminary results to report the efficacy and safety of sclerotherapy using ok for postoperative lymphoceles at our institutionwe retrospectively analyzed  patients who underwent sclerotherapy using ok for postoperative pelvic and paraaortic lymphoceles between april   and march   at our institution all patients were treated by percutaneous drainage before sclerotherapy the indications for sclerotherapy are persistently drainage tube output more than  ml per day or recurrent lymphoceles after percutaneous drainage if drainage tube drained less than ml per day after sclerotherapy the tube was removed when drainage tube output didnt become less than ml per day after first sclerotherapy second ok injection was performed one week later technical success was defined as the completion of the drainage and sclerotherapy procedures clinical success was defined as resolution of patients symptoms resulting from lymphoceles without surgical intervention we also evaluated complications of sclerotherapy and progress after sclerotherapythe mean initial lymphocele size was ml range  ml the mean drainage duration after sclerotherapy was  days  days the mean injection volume of ok was  ke technical success rate was   clinical success rate was    patient with hydronephrosis did not improve three patients were treated by twosession sclerotherapy minor complications occurred in  patients and all  presented with mild fever major complication occurred in  patient the patient presented with small bowel fistula no recurrence of lymphoceles was observed during a mean followup period of  months range lymphoceles are postoperative cystic collections of lymph fluid surrounded by a fibrous wall lacking epithelium lymphoceles result from the disruption of the lymphatic vessels after pelvic andor paraaortic lymphadenectmy lymphoceles can cause hydronephrosis infection abdominal pain leg edema and deep venous thrombosis the incidence of symptomatic lymphoceles has been reported to range from  to  depending on the type of surgery asymptomatic lymphoceles resolve spontaneously without treatment but symptomatic lymphoceles require treatment treatment options for symptomatic lymphoceles include percutaneous fine needle aspiration percutaneous catheter drainage percutaneous catheter drainage with sclerotherapy lymphatic embolization and surgery in general minimally invasive treatment have become the first treatment option percutaneous fine needle aspiration is no longer performed due to high recurrence rate the need for frequent punctures and infection risk lymphatic embolization has been reported as a treatment option because of high success rate and low recurrence rate however lymphatic embolization is often chosen when the patient has not responded to previous treatment eg percutaneous catheter drainage with or without sclerotherapy and this procedure is required learning curve in the past external drainage and internal marsupialization via laparotomy or laparoscopy were considered the treatment of choice however surgery was relatively high risks of complications eg injury to the bladder and ureter ileus and long hospitalization in present percutaneous catheter drainage with or without sclerotherapy is primary treatment choice for symptomatic lymphoceles and has achieved high success rate various agents have been used for sclerotherapy including povidoneiodine ethanol tetracycline bleomycin and fibrin glue but a consensus has not reached yet about sclerosing agents for lymphoceles ok is a lyophilized mixture of a low pathogenic strain of streptococcus pyogenes su incubated with benzylpenicillin in japan it is widely used as treatment for malignant pleural effusions chylothorax pneumothorax sclerotherapy with ok has been reported to be effective in the treatment of benign cysts such as lymphangioma and ranula the mechanism of action of ok on benign cysts is to immediately induce inflammation causing inflammatory cells to invade the cyst and cause the cyst to adhere there have been few reports of sclerotherapy with ok  picibanil chugai pharmaceutical co ltd tokyo japan for lymphoceles in the english literature the purpose of this study was to report the efficacy and safety of sclerotherapy using ok at our institutionthis study has been approved by the institutional review broad of osaka university hospital we retrospectively analyzed  patients who underwent sclerotherapy using ok for postoperative pelvic and paraaortic lymphoceles between april   and march   at our institution  patients were diagnosed in  lymphoceles  patients were after surgical procedure for gynecological cancer and  patient was postoperative for rectal cancer characteristics of the patient are provided in table  the diagnosis of lymphoceles was based on clinical course and imaging findings infection of lymphoceles was confirmed with fever elevated white blood cell count and creactive protein or bacterial culturing of drainage fluid none of the patients had received previous surgical treatment for lymphoceles but  patient was treated with ok after failing to respond to sclerotherapy with ethanol povidoneiodine fibrin glue and minocyclineall patients were treated by percutaneous drainage before sclerotherapy  patients had undergone percutaneous drainage for lymphoceles and once the tubes were removed later lymphoceles recurred and percutaneous drainage was performed again percutaneous drainage was performed by experienced interventional radiologist under ultrasound or computed tomography ct guidance  to french pigtail catheter dawsonmueller drainage catheters cook medical was placed into the cavity drainage tube was exchanged as needed if there were residual fluid the indications for sclerotherapy were persistently drainage tube output more than  ml per day recurrent lymphoceles after percutaneous drainage if drainage tube drained less than ml per day after sclerotherapy the tube was removed when drainage tube output didnt become less than ml per day after first sclerotherapy second ok injections were performed one week later  patient was performed initial percutaneous drainage and consecutively sclerotherapy under the operators judgement  ke of ok contains  mg of dried cocci the klinische einheit ke is used to express the dosage of preparation ok solution was prepared by dissolving mg of ok in ml of half diluted contrast media after emptying the cavity cavitogram was performed to exclude leakage from lymphoceles fig  ok solution was injected into the cavity and left in the cavity for  hours and then the tube was opened the volume of ok used for sclerotherapy was determined by operators preference depending on the size of the cavity technical success was defined as the completion of the drainage and sclerotherapy procedures clinical success was defined as resolution of patients symptoms resulting from lymphoceles without surgical intervention the estimated volume of the lymphocele was calculated by ct volumetry using the software aquarius intuition edition v  complications were evaluated as minor or major according to the society of interventional radiology guidline major complications were defined as treatmentrelated adverse event requiring further therapy increased in the level of care or prolonged hospitalization minor complications were defined as treatmentrelated adverse event requiring nominal therapy or no treatment with or without overnight hospitalization for observation the mean initial lymphocele size was ml range  ml the mean drainage duration after sclerotherapy was  days  days initial lymphocele size is unrelated to drainage duration after sclerotherapy fig  the mean injected volume of ok was  ke technical success was   clinical success was    patient with hydronephrosis did not improve  patients were treated by twosession sclerotherapy table minor complications occurred in  patients and all  presented with mild fever major complication occurred in  patient the patient presented with fever one month later after sclerotherapy ct findings showed abscess in pelvic percutaneous drainage was performed and cavitogram showed small bowel fistula fig  consequently the small bowel fistula was resolved by only percutaneous drainage no recurrence of lymphoceles was observed during a mean followup period of  months range a variety of sclerosing agents have been used for sclerotherapy of lymphoceles in the previous reports  in our study  patient underwent sclerotherapy with various sclerosing agents but the sclerotherapy did not respond therefore sclerotherapy with ok was performed the experience of this case led to the use of ok at our institution we achieved a  clinical success in our date this result is similar to the success rate of sclerotherapy with ethanol or povidoneiodine in the previous reports table  however the mean drainage duration of ok sclerotherapy  days was shorter than ethanol or povidoneiodine sclerotherapy table sclerotherapy with ethanol or povidoneiodine was performed in multiple sessions whereas sclerotherapy with ok in our study was often performed in one session   which may have resulted in a shorter drainage period because ok is a strong irritant we think that sclerotherapy with ok was able to be completed in one session in our study major complication small bowel fistula occurred in one patient the patient had an infected lymphocele and was treated with sclerotherapy using ok which resulted in small bowel fistula to the best of our knowledge there have been no reports of scarring or dysfunction of the surrounding tissues due to ok and side effects are limited to mild fever after injection probably the small intestine wall was fragile due to infection and the fistula was caused by the administration of ok although the location of lymphocele was confirmed by ct before percutaneous drainage we couldnt confirm the adjacent organs of the lymphocele just before administering ok we consider that the adjacent organs should have been identified by ct once before the administration in our study initial lymphocele size is unrelated to drainage duration after sclerotherapy this result is supported by the report of alago w et al  although ok is more expensive than ethanol and povidoneiodine ok sclerotherapy facilitate early discharge owing to shorter drainage period which may save overall hospital cost some limitations should be noted first this study is the small sample size and retrospective study in a single institution further investigation should be needed including treatment results in large prospective study and comparison of results with other sclerosing agents second no one operator performed the sclerotherapy and the procedure was not standardized due to variability in the technique according to individual operator preference however drainage period of ok sclerotherapy was shorter than ethanol or povidoneiodine sclerotherapy therefore we think the results of our study demonstrate that this method is valuable it may be necessary to evaluate thatok is valuable using appropriate protocol forthe optimaldoseandtiming of administrationsclerotherapy with ok is an effective therapeutic method for lymphoceles the advantage of ok is that it is able to be completed in one session and the drainage period is shortened major complication occurred in  patient in this study and attention to adjacent organs may be necessary before administering ok karcaaltincaba m akhan o radiologic

Response to reviewer comments,CAUNE_7233_2.docx,Response to reviewer comments,CAUNE_7233_2.docx,the authors carry out a systematic review to try to analyze the impact of the virus on the olfactory pathway as input the review includes the inclusion of observational studies the study is interesting but some points should be consideredq the title is not clearly related to the study there is nothing that includes neuroprotection mechanisms and the title should be more related to the content of the article anosmia or olfatory disfunctiona thank you for the reviewers comment as the reviewer suggested we have made changes to the title of our study we have changed the wording of anosmia to olfactory dysfunction and neuroprotection to neuroinvasion to make the title more related to the articles contenttitle a systematic review on neurological aspects of covid exploring the relationship between covidrelated anosmia olfactory dysfunction and neuroprotection neuroinvasionq the systematic review methodologically it is correct although it should include an analysis of at least i although i dont think it changes anything it is required in a systematic review the only thing is that the key kords used are not inclusive of all items that may be related and they are not exclusive either the finding of related markers in the virus is infrequent especially if the rna is not analyzed this design is not easy it seems fine to me but this bias should be clearly identified in the articlea thank you for the reviewers suggestion for including the analysis of heterogeneity i in the systematic review our study included a systematic review of observational studies which mainly were case reports and with our study outcome we could not conduct a metaanalysis of the studies therefore we did not conduct a heterogeneity analysis in our systematic review moreover we have excluded the exploratory analysis that we conducted in this study and only presented the systematic review of the current articles as per the suggestion of reviewer  thus the related concern with the analysis does not need to be further reviewed the keyword neuroprotection provided in the abstract section has been replaced with neuroinvasionthe included studies did not analyze the rna strain of the sarscov because of which we were unable to revise our manuscript on the related point and have added it as the limitation of our studywe could not investigate the neurological aspects of different strains of sarscov in covid infected patients and geographical and temporal relationships particularly concerning olfactory alteration because information about the sarscov strain along with geographical and temporal information was not available in the included studiesq the frequency of olfactory alterations has changed for geographical and temporal reasons and for the different strains in wuham it was barely  in europe in the first wave it was  these factors should be included in the analysis because they probably represent a confounding factor in the resultsanother aspect that could have been analyzed in the studies are those that are related to long covid persistence at three monthsa thank you for the reviewers comment on the changes in the frequency of olfactory dysfunction that are mainly seen due to geographical and temporal reasons and the different strains as the reviewer suggested these factors can be confounding factors in the study so we revisited all the included articles however since the included papers were case reports and case series most literature did not mention the geographical and temporal region and neither have analyzed the sarscov variants nor have mentioned the persistence of the olfactory disorders moreover since we have omitted the exploratory analysis as per reviewer s request these factors are not required to be further explored in the review thus we have pointed out the related suggestion as to the limitation of our studywe could not investigate the neurological aspects of different strains of sarscov in covid infected patients and geographical and temporal relationships particularly concerning olfactory alteration because information about the sarscov strain along with geographical and temporal information was not available in the included studiesq to define the relationship with the cns neurological conditions such as gbs have been used but this condition is not related to the form of entry into the cns nor to the mechanism since in that case an immune mechanism could be considered and not directly related to the virusa thank you for the reviewers suggestion about the gbs mechanism not being directly related to the virus but having immune mediatedmechanism in the covidinfected patients we have checked the manuscript and would like to confirm that gbs is mentioned in the demographic table and text to indicate the neurological diagnosis made on the patients by the clinicianreported in the literature our primary purpose was to explore whether olfactory dysfunction is related to the csf pcr result of sarscov in covid infected patients who had neurological symptoms thus we only explored neurological aspects and the possibility of direct neuroinvasion in these patients as you have indicated the gbs condition is not related to the mechanism of direct neuroinvasion into the cns but could have an immune mechanism which we did not review in detail therefore we have presented this point as the limitation of our study since the indirect mechanism of sarscov neuroinvasion should not be ignoredsimilarly the possibility of an indirect mechanism of neuroinvasion of sarscov should not be overlooked  the study is interesting the questions could have been more specific and a better stratification but in general it supposes an analysis of the literature i think the authors should reanalyze the discussion it is not new to what is in the literature it does not analyze the methodology and it is too longa thank you for the reviewers response on the discussion being too long and for making our content more specific therefore we have made an effort to shorten the length of the discussion part while shortening the discussion part we have made some modifications that led to various changes in the paragraphs such as we have omitted the neurological symptom observed in the covid patients which led to the omission of one reference from our study the rearrangement of the sentences to shorten the discussion subheading also led to the modified version of the reference number the modifications made in our revised manuscript version are highlighted and presented after editing the points mentioned by reviewer  at the end of the revision response sectionq please clearly indicate what type of study this is this is not a systematic review as you have done some exploratory analysis pooling the studies that reported anosmia status and csf pcr creates a potential for bias as most of the studies are based on case reports and series therefore this would be best if you just summarize the current literature without the exploratory analysis and call it a systematic reviewa thank you for the reviewers suggestion as the reviewer suggested for defining our study as a systematic review we have excluded the exploratory analysis we conducted in our study we omitted the analysis which did not have a statistically significant result and only summarized the included literature for exploring the neurological aspects of covid and provided the proportion of the patients with anosmia status and csf pcr assay resultsobjectives to identify neurological aspects of coronavirus disease  covid and to explore the association of anosmia with the investigate the covid infected patients with and without olfactory dysfunction in relation to their result of polymerase chain reaction pcr assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov in the cerebrospinal fluid csfpubmed and embase databases were searched until march   for observational studies with covid patients that had performed csf pcr assay due to the neurologic symptom and reported anosmia status association between csf pcr assay results and anosmia status were evaluated using fischers exact testinitially  studies were identified studies performed sarscov csf pcr assay of which our review comprised  observational studies that conducted csf pcr assay for sarscov in  patients and reported anosmia status in  of  patients central and peripheral neurological manifestations observed in covid patients were diverse the most common neurological diagnoses made on those patients were guillainbarr syndrome and its variants  followed by encephalopathy  the sarscov pcr assay was positive in only four csf samples two had olfactory dysfunction while others did not though patients with anosmia were less likely to have positive csf pcr results than those without nasal symptoms it was not significant odds ratio  cithe neurological spectrum of covid is diverse and the direct neuroinvasion of sarscov is rare the nonsignificant relationship observed in our study indicates that neuroprotection against sarscov in covid patients with anosmia is controversial as an equal number of patients with and without olfactory dysfunction had positive csf pcr results for sarscov in our study and further studies are required to provide more insight into this topicthis systematic review aimed to compile studies involving covid patients with neurological manifestations who have undergone polymerase chain reaction pcr testing for sarscov in cerebrospinal fluid csf and reported the patients anosmia status for identifying neurological aspects of covid and exploring the relationship between covid infected patients with or without anosmia and in relation to their csf pcr assay resultsoutcomes the odds ratio was assessed between csf pcr assay results and anosmia status using fischers exact test ibm spss statistics version  meanwhile two of the out of four patients with positive csf pcr results for sarscov two had smell disorder andwhile the other two did not experience olfactory dysfunction table  patients with smell disorder had  times lower odds of having positive csf pcr results for sarscov than those without a smell disorder odds ratio or  confidence interval ci presults and anosmia the neurological manifestations of covid are diverse there were equal number of patients with and without olfactory disorders who had positive csf pcr results for sarscov our study showed that patients with smell disorders have lower odds of having positive csf pcr results for sarscov than those without smell disorders or  ci however this difference was not significant which could be due to the small sample size issues are solved though patients with anosmia were less likely to have positive csf pcr results than those without nasal symptoms this difference was not significant q you cannot comment on the general manifestations of covid infection since you have already excluded a good number of studies that did not report anosmia so the manifestations in this paper are only exclusive to patients who had reported anosmia status in the literature which does not necessarily reflect the general neurologic manifestations of covid infectiona thank you for the reviewers comment we agree that our study only focused on studies that reported anosmia status limiting our study on the general neurological manifestations of covid infection therefore we have presented this as a limitation of our studythough anosmia is common in covid patients underreport underreporting issues cannot be ignored and because of our methodology limitation the neurological manifestations observed in covid individuals cannot be generalized q im not sure how useful these results are when one of the cells in the x table has  patients  patients with positive csf pcr the number is so low that the risk of a biased result is higha thank you for the reviewers response on this point we know that one of the table cells has  patients that could have a high risk of bias in the analysis therefore to avoid such risk of bias we conducted our analysis using the fishers test instead of the chisquared method however since we have omitted the exploratory analysis as per your suggestion in q this concern no longer needs to be reviewedq in the treatment and outcomes section if a study has not reported what treatment was done then you cannot assume that they didnt do steroids ivig plex or hcq you need to mention missing data and how you handled those in the analysisa thank you for the reviewers comment we have revised all the included literature and if the article has not reported the information on the treatment or outcome then we reported such data in our manuscript as not reported therefore the symbol dash  and the superscript a were used to denote data not reported in the demographic table however the symbol dash and the superscript a were replaced with nr not reported to make it more precise and the missing data were not used in the analysis moreover since we have excluded the analysis as per q the concern about the missing data in the analysis disappearsnotes a denotes data not reported dash nr denotes data not reported in the studies f means female m means male pos means positive and neg means negativeq the conclusion is not supported by the results of this study again the risk of bias is high and the results are based on a sample of  positive csf pcra thank you for the reviewers comment our study found only four positive csf pcr results in patients with or without smell defects indicating that direct neuroinvasion of sarscov is rare and anosmia status has no relation to the sarscov neuroinvasion the direct invasion of sarscov was also reported to be rare in a large csf study discussion section it was found that only  of patients had positive csf pcr results for sarscov however we agree that a low sample in our study could present bias in our result which was presented as our studys limitationin our study approximately  of the participants had positive csf pcr assay for sarscov similar to the finding of one study which showed positive results in  of the participants indicating sarscov neuroinvasion is a rare occurrence issues are solved though patients with anosmia were less likely to have positive csf pcr results than those without nasal symptoms this difference was not significant the number of patients with positive csf pcr results did not differ by anosmia status which may be related to the limited sample size and uncommon csf pcr assay procedure q in the first paragraph of the discussion please add the pvalue to the reported odds ratio and ci in the parenthesis or just say that   lower odds of a thank you for the reviewers response as per the reviewers q we have removed our exploratory analysis therefore we have modified our result and the discussion section accordingly please check a q you cannot imply causation hereit is also noteworthy that infection with sarscov resulted in parkinsons disease in a patient experiencing smell disorder with no family historythe temporal relationship here is vague this patient might have had parkinsons that was unmasked at time of covid diagnosis plus anosmia is common among pd patients regardless of infection with covid or not please rephrase or take out and this will affect the sentence that follows thata thank you for the reviewers suggestion as per the reviewers suggestion we have removed this sentence from our discussion section it is also noteworthy that infection with sarscov resulted in parkinsons disease in a patient experiencing smell disorder with no family history  therefore in addition covid patients with olfactory disorders and other severe neurological symptoms should be examined for possible neurodegenerative disease when suspected of having oneq please include the financial concerns about the benefits of such tests therefore despite the procedural and logistical complexity the authors suggest an early collection of csf samples performing csf pcr assay for sarscov detecting antineuronal autoantibodies and using  f fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in suspected cases could aid in the diagnosis and management of the patients notably in magnetic resonance imaging negative casesa thank you for the reviewers response as per the reviewers suggestion we looked into the related topic and have added the financial concerns about the benefits of such a complex test in the discussion sectioncases   although the additional financial concern associated with the csf pcr assay cannot be avoided there were cases of testing positive in csf pcr assay despite being negative in nasal pcr or rapid covid test   in addition costeffective studies in other neurotropic viruses have shown that the csf pcr assay is costeffective similar studies in covid are required q in the flow diagram of the study selection process i dont understand why you have an extra step of looking at studies that conducted csf studies you can just go straight to studies that conducted csf pcra thank you for the reviewers suggestion we agree that we can directly pool studies that conducted csf pcr and do not require to take the extra step for pooling studies that conducted csf studies we did so because we wanted to check the proportion of the studies that conduct csf studies but not csf pcr assay to make our point clearer we have added it on the discussion section however if the reviewer thinks it is a necessity for the edition of the flowchart in our manuscript we will edit the manuscript and figure accordinglyperiod of symptom onset giving negative results   in addition according to our review only  of the published articles on csf studies performed csf pcr assay for sarscov in covid infected patients who experienced neurological symptoms therefore despiteq for figure  please remove the lines as you cannot place lines on categorical variables with measures of frequency what does the dot in the middle of the bar represent its certainly not a central measure of tendency also will need a clearer legend and better explanation under the graph for what we are looking ata thank you for the reviewers comment we modified our figure removed all the lines from the graph and presented the age and sex distribution of covid infected patients who underwent csf pcr assay for sarscov we have also edited our legend for a clearer and better explanation of the graphfig  impact of covid on sex and agegroup age and sex distribution of covid patients who underwent csf pcr assay for sarscov the number of men and women infected with covid who developed severe neurological manifestation and underwent csf pcr assay for sarscov increased as the age of the individuals increased the impact of covid was higher in patients aged  to  years old in of both sexes in addition the covid infected males were in higher numbers than covid infected women of all ages nr denotes that the age of two males and one female was not reporteda thank you for the reviewers suggestion through the word cloud we wanted to view the clinical presentation of the covid on the targeted patients the symptoms were diverse so we could not summarize those symptoms in the table or the manuscript we are sorry that we did not mention it in the manuscript and have added the point for a more precise explanation we think that the figure will be meaningful to look for the symptoms observed in the covid infected patients even though we will exclude the figure from the manuscript if the reviewer still regards the unnecessity of figure  in this study and comments to exclude the figurethe neurological symptoms that were commonly seen in covid individuals were diverse making it difficult to summarize in the table the therefore the data visualization was adapted using a word cloud for the frequently occurring symptoms fig  the word cloud highlights the common neurological symptoms experienced by presentation of covid in patients with coronavirus disease  covid who underwent csf pcr assay for sarscovq for figure  where is this graph from if this was

factor for sarscov infection science   p the finding of this review on common neurological manifestation is consistent with the findings of a systematic review that reported myalgia headache altered sensorium hyposmia and hypogeusia as the most common neurological symptoms observed in covid patients  covid can trigger other autoimmune neurological complications infections such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders or multiple sclerosis    thus autoimmune neurological complications involving the cns which should be identified and treated promptly furthermore a a negative csf pcr assay does not rule out the presence of the virus in the cns therefore further studies of sarscov antibodies are required  moreover a recent study has shown that sarscov retrograde neuroinvasion via the olfactory route causes neuroinflammation  the detection of sarscov in the olfactory nerve epithelium and various radiological findings in patients with covid suggests that despite the rarity of sarscov neuroinvasion via the olfactory system it should not be overlooked    similar to other respiratory neurotropic viruses the direct neuroinvasion of sarscov in covid patients could use the olfactory route for neuroinvasion similar to other respiratory neurotropic viruses occur mainly in two ways damage to the olfactory epithelium or diffusion through the olfactory ensheathing cell oec   figure  an animal study has shown that apoptosis of orns can block the cns transmission of the respiratory neurotropic virus  a recent study on hamsters showed that sarscov infects orns and the virus has also been detected in the olfactory bulb and other parts of the brain supporting sarscov neuroinvasion via the olfactory route  similarly viral invasion through olfactory neuroepithelium could activate antiviral responses in the orns and olfactory bulb of fish activating proinflammatory mediators and neuronal apoptosis clearing viruses and regulating their entry and replication  it is hypothesized that some individuals lose their sense of smell not because the virus damages the olfactory epithelium but because the human defense mechanism destroys anything that the virus may find useful    however although orns of humans do not express sarscov entry proteins factors other than angiotensinconverting enzyme may be involved in a viral entry such as neurolipin which is highly expressed in orns   or sarscov can have nonneuronal mechanism    the neuronal and nonneuronal damage of the olfactory epithelium are responsible for the mechanism of loss of smell observed in covid patients    nevertheless viruses that are rapidly transported to the olfactory bulb before being affected by orn apoptotic actions may invade the cns in contrast the detection of sarscov in mature and immature orns sustentacular sus cells and myeloid cells suggests that factors other than angiotensinconverting enzyme  ace may be involved in viral entry   studies have shown that sarscov can utilize factors such as neurolipin which is highly expressed in orns as an alternative receptor to enter some cell types particularly those lacking ace   sarscov is assumed to be transferable from the sus cells to orns as these cells are close together through exosome pathways as observed in the herpes virus   moreover since stem cells also express ace  viruses from the sus cells are thought to move to stem cells consequently generating immature orns that will develop into mature orns and transfer the virus directly to the olfactory bulb and beyond  additionally immune cell infiltration and tissue damage may lead to the virus spreading through cells of the olfactory epithelium  nevertheless viruses that are rapidly transported to the olfactory bulb before being affected by orn apoptotic actions may invade the cns besides viruses viruses as small as nm can also diffuse via the channels formed by the olfactory ensheathing cell oec and gain gaining direct access to the csf   interestingly particles as small as nm can enter the cns through these channels  the size of sarscov ranges from  to  nm  additionally direct infection of the oec can release viruses into these channels and subsequently transport the virus to the olfactory bulb  thus sarscov with a smaller size can utilize this mode of viral transmission the possible mechanism of sarscov neuroinvasion via the olfactory route is shown in figure recognition of the virus in the nasal cavity activates the immune system which recruits cytokines and other inflammatory mediators that initiate an antiviral response within the nasal epithelium   these cytokines can cause apoptosis of orn or damage sus cells or lead to loss of cilia in both orns and sus cells thereby causing loss of smell until the regeneration of olfactory epithelium occurs which may take approximately  days postinfection   one study utilized the nasal mucosa sampling method and found that sarscov can infect various cell types including mature and immature orns in the olfactory neuroepithelium of patients with covid and apoptosis of mature orns might be the primary cause of covidrelated anosmia  therefore studies studies analyzing the olfactory mucosa of covid patients with and without anosmia are required to acknowledge that apoptosis of orns is the cause of covidrelated anosmia the authors recommend nasal mucosa brush sampling rather than a nasopharyngeal sample for detecting sarscov at least in patients with olfactory disorders  future studies with a larger sample size involving nasal brush sampling method and csf pcr assay can be performed on covid patients to determine whether apoptosis of orns could provide neuroprotection in covid patients with anosmia overall the risk of bias of in the included studies was low except for three studies    the summary of jbi critical appraisal results for case reports and case series can be seen in supplementary tables  and the total number of participants was  while the sarscov csf pcr testing was performed in on only  patients table  shows the characteristics of the  participants included in the review about   were men the mean age was  years the number of men and women infected with covid increased with age covid infected patients in of both sexes predominantly in the  age group figure the most common covidrelated neurological symptoms were smell disorder taste disorder headache myalgia altered consciousness related paresis and related cognitive and behavioral disturbancesadditionally studies determining that determine whether apoptosis of orns occurs in covid patients experiencing anosmia along with and sarscov csf pcr assays are not available too for these reasons the study design for analyzing the study hypothesis was only feasible with observational studies though the risk of bias assessment showed an overall low risk fundamental bias from the study design is hardly excluded, responses to the reviewers comments reviewer   title page

Response to reviewer comments,DKPIE_9.docx,Response to reviewer comments,DKPIE_9.docx,using the database of an elderly health examination in taipei city from  to  the authors explored associated risk factors with rapid renal function decline in elderly patients and effects of rapid renal function decline on cancer mortality outcome the idea of the paper was good but it needs a lot of modification to be published in epih inability to access the treatment history information of cancer patients was the biggest limitation of this study for the robustness and validity of the results itll be good to link or use another data such as cancer registration data which can tell the stage even a summary stage of the cancer patientsthanks for the suggestion indeed the major limitation of this dataset is the lack of clinical treatment information and cancer registration data we will try to apply other dataset for further validation in the future your suggestion will be included in our limitation the database we used did not have clinical treatment information nor have cancer stage information the health checkup data only linked to the cause of death database therefore the treatment effect or the severity of the cancer status cannot be evaluated objectives kidney disease in cancer patients is associated with higher mortality we aimed to assess the impact of renal function decline on the cancer mortality among the elderly in the communitiesmethods did you explicitly performed multivariate logistic regression not multivariable logistic regression to assess the association between baseline covariates and deteriorated egfr if not you should describe the model as multivariable logistic regression modelresponse we performed multivariate logistic regression in this case our response variable is defined as the binary variable by the egfr or  mlminmyear and our explanatory variables are the baseline covariates results line  generally sitespecific cancer risk means sitespecific cancer incidence occurrence risk please clarify that it means mortality risk in the first verse of the sentenceresponse currently there is the latest literature published on  january  showed that cancer incidence data in us from  to  we have updated the reference there   siegel rl miller kd fuchs he jemal a cancer statistics  ca cancer j clin  lines  is it the essential content that what cancers are the four most common cancers in taiwan in this introduction for your paperresponse the readers might not know the most prevalent cancers in taiwan we think that it is appropriate to mention them in the introduction the number of deaths due to cancer was  which accounted for  of all causes of mortality making the standardized mortality rate of cancer  per  persons in lines  who were the exact denominator for those percentages  and  cancer patients or cancer patients with anticancer medicationsresponse the denominator of  is from  all cancer patients the denominator of  is the elderly aged  years from  of  patients  patients the cited reference mentioned the cancer patients who were being treated for solid tumors therefore we still used the term cancer patients  the denominator of  is from  all cancer patients the denominator of  is the elderly aged  years from  of  patients  patientsif the authors hypothesis and the purpose was to evaluate the extent of which the effect of decreased egfr andor proteinuria on increased cancer mortality is modified by rapid renal function decline these literatures may be meaningful otherwise it seems to distract the flow of the text and causes confusionresponse yes we want to evaluate the effect of the effect of decreased egfr andor proteinuria on increased cancer mortality especially for the case of rapid renal decline line  what does malignancy mean does it mean that the impact of rapid renal function decline on the occurrence survival and death in malignant tumor patients are all consideredtherefore the aim of this study is to assess the impact of renal function decline on the cancer mortality among the elderly in the communitiesthe content of the overall article needs to be made more concise and there are many cases where the content and the title of each subsection are inappropriately matched so it needs to be correctedline  i recommend the ethics or ethical statements subsection to be located in the last of the methods sectionlines  this research  in taipei city it seems more appropriate to place this sentence at the beginning of selection of participants subsectionlines  this database  before release it seems more appropriate to place this sentence at the end of data source subsectionlines  and line  these two descriptions regarding informed consent are contradictory did you mean that the informed consent was received from participants when they are enrolled in the elderly health examination survey or study but the use of that data for this study was permitted with a waiver of informed consent if it is right the former declaration can be omitted with clarifying that this study used a secondary data or can be located in the data source subsection what was the exact scope of your research teams conduct please indicate the relevant contents clearly and separatelyparticipants were enrolled with informed consent signed and submitted to taipei city government to record health examination data for research purposes the study protocol was approved by the institutional review board irb of biomedical science research academia sinica irb no asirbbm  in this study we applied the anonymous secondary data for analysis and thus the consents were waived by irb lines  it is necessary to describe in more detail the specific data collection method in the elderly health examination items and methods of anthropometric measurements and laboratory tests whether questionnaires were implemented and its items and methods etcresponse the examination includes a standardized medical examination clinical evaluation oral examination eye examination anthropometric measures and biochemical tests and questionnaire that addresses a variety of healthrelated topics the total length of the codebook is up to  pages with too many variables we only list the variables we used in the definition of variablesthe examination includes a standardized medical examination clinical evaluation oral examination eye examination anthropometric measures and biochemical tests and questionnaires that address a variety of healthrelated topicslines     and fig what is the significance or necessity of the number of visits do these counting play a significant role in presenting the main results laterresponse because our focus is on the cancer mortality risk from the deterioration of renal function we have excluded those participants having only visits the slope of the egfr is computed from multiple visits other variables are all from the baseline  lines  the contents need to be shortened to be more concise lines  lines  and lines  seem to be redundantlines the renal function estimated glomerular filtration rate egfr is one of our important explanatory variables thus visits without serum creatinine data or with abnormal egfr   mlminm were excluded visits  this is to highlight our major explanatory variable and how we set the criterion for ensuring data quality therefore we kept the sentence lines  the main purpose of this study is to elucidate the association between declining renal function and cancer mortalitylines  the icd codes of neoplasms are defined from  to  and the icd codes are defined in malignant neoplasms cc of icd line  according to figure  it seems that the description for the exclusion case of missing cause of death is omittedresponse you misunderstand our meaning we said that the date of health checkup later than the date of death should be removed because the temporal resolution of the cause of death record only contains year and month we used the th of the month to impute the death date if the date of health checkup is later the imputed date we excluded those cases line  it seems describe the result more clearly to provide the number of allcause deaths followed by the number of cancer deaths and noncancer deathsresponse thanks because our focus is cancer deaths thus we presented the cancer deaths first and then from other causes we take your suggestion to modify the sentences  in this study we found  elderly from allcause deaths including  died from cancer and  died from other causesline  before the subsection definition of variables i recommend to add another subsection eg data collection and followup this paper lacks specific and summarized descriptions of the methods for data collection in elderly health examination along with the contents of lines  and  those contents are not corresponding to the definition of variables subsection it is needed to provide the principles or methods for measuring the major variables variables used in this paper of participants clinical conditions and baseline comorbidities for instance if an elderly health examination has included a survey questionnaire and youve used several variables in this survey data you should clarify that those variables were obtained from the survey data following a brief description about the survey and how it was structured and conducted subsequently the contents of lines  can provided in the same subsection rather than in statistical analyses sectionresponse thanks for the comments i think that you have misunderstood our study design the elderly health examination is the government funded health examination unlike the traditional survey the research team needed to sample the participants this examination in taipei city is open to all elderly registered in taipei city each year taipei city government announced the date for registration and the quota is fixed and adjusted in different years the reason we did not report the detailed data collection procedure because we analyzed the database majorly based on the codebook the medical examination are all conducted in the taipei city hospital all participation are voluntarybased the repeated participation is not required but we found higher percentage of repeated participation the clinical condition and baseline comorbidities are from the interview by the trained case managers with structured questionnaires the participants were interviewed by trained case managers using a structured questionnaire to inquire about demographic information lifestyle behaviors such as cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking preexisting comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension and medications the anthropometric parameters including body height body weight blood pressure and waist circumference were measured during the medical checkup bmi was calculated as body weight kg divided by body height m squared the results of biochemical test from blood samples were used for analysis a urine dipstick that tested for proteinuria was divided into negative trace   and  and above lines  and  is there any reason for selecting those six specific cancers and reporting their results particularlyresponse we have added the reason there we did not select the disease specifically the six specific cancers are the highest six types of cancers in this dataset because original gynecological cancers had both male and female cancers after the reanalysis the male prostate cancer had  cancers which was the fifth highest cancer deaths in this dataset therefore we replace gynecological cancer with prostate cancer in the revisionsome sentences throughout the manuscript seem to be not polished enough and it is difficult to see them as professional sentences suitable for publication as an article for example the tenses pastpresentfuture are inappropriately mixed in lines  and the sentences in lines  need to be connected more fluentlyresponse thanks for comments we asked the english editor to help us check the tense problem the lines  were modified   line  statistical analyses should be one of subsections included in the methods section like other subsections of data source selection of participants definition of variables etcthroughout those tables  explicit interpretation is so difficult due to the inconsistent flow of the results presentation frame or it is so confusing due to insufficient information presented about the results in the tables i suggest to reorganize those tables into either a or b below to make a presentation of your results much clearertable  overall  four groups stratified by baseline egfr same as nowtable  three groups stratified by the survivaldeath categories died from cancer died from other causes and survived it is for the congruity with the result of table  and in this case the variable egfr decline  should be included in the table table  provide adjusted or values of each variable according to the four groups stratified by baseline egfr like in table  in this case the variable baseline egfr should be excluded from the logistic modeltable  provide adjusted hr values of each variable according to the four groups stratified by baseline egfr like in table  in this case the variable baseline egfr should be excluded from the cox modeltable  overall  two groups stratified by egfr decline rapid renal deterioration it is for the congruity with the result of table table  three groups stratified by the survivaldeath categories died from cancer died from other causes and survived it is for the congruity with the result of table  and in this case the variable egfr decline  should be included in the tabletable  provide both crude and adjusted or values of each variabletable  provide both crude and adjusted hr values of each variablein addition if you choose suggest b it would be possible to change the order of table  and table  because tables  and  and tables  and  are pairs that lead to respective same outcomes so it can be easier to read and interpretateundoubtedly it is a much better option for the authors to reconstruct the tables with your own suggestion that can present the results more clearlyresponse thanks for this valuable and constructive comments we followed your suggestion a to reorganize the tables and adapt results as the manuscript response ok in the method section we have described how we classified the proteinuria we added the classification after the textthose with rapid decline were slightly older p and had higher baseline egfr p and a higher percentage of proteinuria p cancer deaths with rapid renal decline had  of proteinuria with  and above table  lines  the title of the second subsection is association between risk factors and rapid renal deterioration in all elderly participants according to this title do you think baseline egfr is a risk factor for rapid renal deterioration can you explain the evidence supporting causality for the association between those two factors isnt a rapid renal function deterioration just likely to occur when baseline egfr value is high because the decrease of egfr can be larger in that caseresponse thanks for your comment we have explained the evidence about the association between baseline egfr and rapid renal deterioration in discussion we agreed with that the risk factors might be an inappropriate expression we revised the title with association between the baseline characteristics and rapid renal deterioration in all elderly participants  tables  and  if you will continue to take results for six sitespecific cancer deaths indicate in the table that this is a count of mortality not incidenceresponse in table  and  the counts of the six sitespecific cancer are the number of deaths in table  the number in the parentheses is the percentage which is computed from the number of specific cancer deaths dividing the number of participants in the strata in table the number in the parentheses is the percentage which is computed from the number of specific cancer deaths dividing the number of all cancer deaths in the stratain table  a the percentage is computed

full names for all abbreviations appearing in the table in the footnote of every table table  are those presented results adjusted or values obtained from multivariable model if they were please clarify itresponse this is multivariate logistic regression with only one binary response whether having rapid renal function declinetable  figure  and appendix  the results presented in table  are those from traditional cox model or from fine and grays model please clarify it and i think the values obtained from fine and grays model should be presented as the main results table  and figure  as it would be a more conservative and elaborate result if the authors disagree please explain whyresponse in table  and figure  the results are conducted by traditional cox model the result in appendix  is conducted by fine and grays model we agreed to move the appendix  into figure   ref  can the results of this study be interpreted as baseline egfr was one of risk factors for rapid egfr decline i think it was just an association but please tell me why you adopted them as a risk factor implying causalityresponse we agreed with the concept of high baseline egfr value relating to rapid egfr decline therefore the text was revised as followsthe factors of rapid gfr decline in populations with normal renal function have been studied in a large cohort of  primary care patients with preserved kidney function koraishy et al indicated that baseline egfr older age africanamerican race unmarried status lower neighborhood socioeconomic status hypertension type  diabetes and smoking were related to rapid egfr decline   mlminyear   lines  what is the reference literature for this content it seems neither reference  nor reference response we have corrected the cited literature of lines  as a new reference  longitudinal study of the decline in renal function in healthy subjects plos one  eref  what was the purpose of citing this literature finally what do the authors want to say about the relationship between baseline egfr and rapid egfr decline the contents of lines  are less persuasive and it is unclear what the authors are trying to say throughout those sentencesresponse thanks for your comments we deleted lines  and references since the participants in the two studies were less relevant to the clinical condition in our population the aim of this paragraph was to demonstrate the consistent features of our participants with rapid egfr decline with previous literatures    is it impossible to link or to use another data such as cancer registration data which can tell the stage even a summary stage of the cancer patients as already noted by the authors the biggest and the most important limitation of this study is an inability to rule out the probability of treatmentinduced nephrotoxicity which can be related to an advanced disease in other words egfr decline can be interpreted as a reliable prognostic factor affecting cancer mortality only when significant results were obtained even after treatment or stage adjustment otherwise this limitation would be the first and most important weakness in this study in contrast the first limitation described in the current manuscript is a relatively trivial limitation  response we agreed your points and added this points into the limitation we have revised the limitation section in discussion first we were unable to know the definite diagnosis time of cancer which was the major limitation of this study therefore we could not determine whether the treatment course changed the degree of kidney function decline especially the chemotherapyinduced nephrotoxicity second the estimated equation for kidney function may overestimate egfr since the elderly with cancer often have cachexia and decreased muscle mass which affects creatinine concentration compared to healthy individuals finally although we had adjusted for the clinical risk factors related to mortality there still may be important residual confounders such as the use of chemotherapeutic agent or cancer stagingthank you for submitting interesting findings on an interesting topic i would like to comment some critical points regarding the methodologystratified analysis of women and men is required to analyze gynecological cancer gynecological cancer  in table  is not correctresponse thanks for the comments we found that your comment is correct we have reanalyzed the analyses original gynecological cancer contains both male and female gynecological cancers together there are  male and  female based our selection criterion on the highest six cancers we picked male prostate cancer to replace original gynecological cancer please clarify the definition of rapid egfr decline and the rationalereferences in the methods please describe in detail how did you calculate egfr decline with the multiple egfr measurementsfor participants who made multiple visits the absolute annual rate of change in egfr was calculated by fitting a leastsquares regression line to all measurements for each participant where the slope of the regression line described the rate of change in egfr the slope was categorized as lower than  or higher than or equal to  mlmin m per year which is defined as the rapid renal function declinethe kidney disease improving global outcomes kdigo  clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease  recommends using a gfr estimating equation to derive the egfr estimated glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine rather than relying on serum creatinine concentration alone the kdigo classified the chronic kidney disease ckd into  stages including g  mlmin m g  mlmin m ga  mlmin m gb  mlmin m g  mlmin m g  mlmin m based on the egfr values in this study we classified egfr in mlmin m into four categories    to   to  and   the number of the participants with egfr is not too much in our study population therefore we did not classify them under egfr line  please provide the rationale for rapid renal deterioration egfr declines   mlmin per  m per yearresponse we have revised the text with based on the kidney disease improving global outcomes kdigo clinical practice guidelines rapid progression is defined as a sustained decline in egfr of more than  mlmin myearin this study participants with cancer diagnosis were included from baseline what is the definition of these cancer patients can you describe when they diagnosed with cancer duration of disease can be an important variable regarding cancer mortalityresponse yes we agree that cancer diagnosis date is important however we dont have that information in this dataset the information we have is their date of cancer deaths based on the information in the cause of death database we used their icd diagnosis to ascertain their cancer diagnosis however we might loss some cancer patients without cancer diagnosis in their major cause of deaths thus we added this information in the limitation  the date of cancer diagnosis and the stages of cancers are not available in the current dataset  therefore it was impossible to disentangle the temporal order between cancer diagnosis and decreased egfr the cancer diagnosis was based on the icd diagnosis in the major cause of deaths we might underestimate some cancer patients without cancer diagnosis in their death registrytable  what is the meaning of comparing the characteristics of cancer deaths by stratifying egfr decline without considering baseline egfrresponse in table  we included egfr in the table the egfr in the table  means baseline egfr we added the term baseline egfr into the table why odds ratios for five continuous variables ie age waist circumference bmi hdl egfr are expressed as per unit increase in explanatory variables please explain why you expressed this way please indicate the unit for each variableamong the various variables why did only tg take logarithms please clarify the reason in the methodsresponse the original distribution of tg is too skew with the skewness of  after log transformation of tg the skewness reduce to  close to normal distribution with the skewness of  in addition we have changed our expression as per unit increase in explanatory variables  the original distribution of tg is too skew with the skewness of  after log transformation of tg the skewness reduce to  close to normal distribution with the skewness of  line  if the multivariable model includes both waist circumference and bmi there may be a problem of multicollinearity it is recommended to check multicollinearity and put only one of waist circumference and bmi into the modelresponse we have checked the multicollinearity issue in our model the variance inflation factors vif of all variables in the logistic regression are less than  in one cohort study in china they also found that bmi and waist circumference were independently associated with allcause mortality among the middleaged and elderly population httpspubmedncbinlmnihgov therefore we still keep bmi and waist circumference as our covariates  please clearly state all cancer mortality in the title please consider the multicollinearity of waist circumference and bmi stage of cancer and onset of cancer are important variables that affect cancer mortality can you include these variables to the cox model response we have checked the vifs which are all less than  in the logistic regression the stage and onset information were lacked in this dataset we have included those into the limitation the date of cancer diagnosis and the stages of cancers are not available in the current dataset  therefore it was impossible to disentangle the temporal order between cancer diagnosis and decreased egfr the cancer diagnosis was based on the icd diagnosis in the major cause of deaths we might underestimate some cancer patients without cancer diagnosis in their death registry  line  this mechanism is a possible explanation only when renal function decline occurs before cancer diagnosis for each participant can you determine which comes first cancer diagnosis or decreased egfr there is a possibility that the characteristics of patients who have already started egfr decline before cancer diagnosis and those who have started egfr decline after cancer diagnosis are completely different it is necessary to analyze the status quo of the precedent relationship and reflect it in the survival analysis it is necessary to analyze the status of the temporal relationship between renal function decline and cancer diagnosis and reflect it in the survival analysisresponse because we dont have information about the diagnosis date of cancer therefore it was impossible to disentangle the temporal order between cancer diagnosis and decreased egfr we have added them into discussion the date of cancer diagnosis and the stages of cancers are not available in the current dataset  therefore it was impossible to disentangle the temporal order between cancer diagnosis and decreased egfr the cancer diagnosis was based on the icd diagnosis in the major cause of deaths we might underestimate some

Response to reviewer comments,DWDOZ_18.docx,Response to reviewer comments,DWDOZ_18.docx,reviewer  comments for the authorin this report jung et al characterized the essential function of ribonucleotide reductase rnr in human pathogen cryptococcus neoformans by manipulating the expression of its essential subunits rnr and rnr using an inducible promoter ctr system and h strong promoter the upstream regulatory pathways of this enzyme complex in dna replication and damage repair under different stress conditions were also genetically dissected although the role of rnr complex has been well studied in other yeasts its role in c neoformans has not been carefully characterized before this study therefore this study provided novel contribution in our understanding of rnr mediated regulation of dna damage repair in response to specific stress signals the manuscript is clearly written in general the conclusions are mostly supported by their data some conclusions are a bit weak as much of evidence is heavily based on the qrtpcr data which often has high level of variations their careful statistic analysis eased some of the concerns i have the following minor comments the manuscript is well written in general but there are a few places that improvement may be needed eg line  and line  both places basically stated the same thing and may be simplified page  line  we deleted the sentence although the regulatory mechanisms of rnr in the ascomycete model yeast s cerevisiae and fungal pathogens have been elucidated the importance of rnrs for viability and regulation of its expression in response to dna replication and damage stresses has not been well studied in basidiomycete fungiline  an explanationhypothesis for the unexpected result fig d may be necessary what the unexpected result means response we agree based on the qrtpcr data expression levels of rnr and rnr previous annotated rnr in ssn and tup mutants were increased in response to hu like wt however their induction levels in the ssn mutant were lower than those in wt although there is no difference between wt and tup mutant strains this data indicate that ssn but not tup is required for the humediated induction of rnr and rnr in c neoformans which is in contrast to the previous finding that both ssn and tup are required for humediated induction of rnr and rnr in s cerevisiae despite the expression patterns strains deleted with ssn or tup showed growth defects in response to hu therefore we added a relevant an explanationhypothesis for the unexpected resultpage  line  although ssn but not tup was required for full induction of rnr and rnr both the ssn and tup mutants showed increased hu sensitivity compared to wt fig dline  the explanation for mms and nqq should be moved up to line  when mentioned the first timepage  line  in s cerevisiae rnr expression is induced in response to diverse dna damaging stress agents such as mms an inducer of dna alkylation and nqo a dna damage inducer through the production of reactive oxygen species   response during the revision process we performed qrtpcr analysis to further address whether bdr and mbs are involved in regulation of rnr rnr previous annotated rnr and rnr previous annotated rnr in response to mms we modified figure  and figure  and added relevant information as followspage  line  however rnr induction occurred in rad and chkindependent manners following both mms treatment and radiation exposure fig b and supplementary fig s next to further address whether bdr and mbs transcription factors are involved in regulation of rnr rnr and rnr we monitored their expression levels in bdr mbs and bdr mbs double mutant under mms treatment similar to the case under hu treatment the expression of rnr was induced in response to mms treatment in the bdr mutant like wt but not in mbs and bdr mbs double mutants fig c in the case of rnr mbs and bdr cooperatively regulated expression levels of rnr in response to mms as shown in hu treatment fig c interestingly mmsmediated induction of rnr expression was not observed in the mbs mutant but restored to wt levels in the bdr mbs double mutant indicating that mbs and bdr may play opposing roles in rnr regulation fig c taken together under dna damage stress induced by mms treatment rad and chk cooperatively regulate expression levels of rnr and rnr as shown in hu treatment and mbs is required for the regulation of rnr rnr and rnrpage  line  fig  the proposed model of rad and chkdependent dna replication and damage stresses in response to hu treatment dna replication stress chk rather than rad plays a role in the regulation of rnr expression through the mbs transcription factor in the case of rnr chk and rad cooperatively control expression levels of rnr through mbs and bdr transcription factors the rnr expression is suppressed by the ssntup complex in response to mms treatment dna damage stress chk and rad equally contribute to rnr induction whereas rad and chk play major and minor roles respectively in rnr induction chk and rad are not involved in the regulation of rnr under both dna replication and damage stresses mbs plays a major role in mmsmediated induction of rnr rnr and rnr whereas bdr is only involved in rnr inductionresponse we agree based on the reviewers comment  we move the data on rnr and rnr previous annotated rnr expression under ctr promoter fig c to fig a therefore we deleted the sentencepage  line  second the orthologs of crt ixr sml and dif genes required for the regulation of rnrs in s cerevisiae have not been identified in the cryptococcus genome page  the data on rnr and rnr expression under ctr promoter control fig c may be move to figure  to support the growth data response we agree we moved figure c to figure  and added rnr expression under ctr promoter in the presence of cuso and bcs treatment in figure  of the revised manuscript the modified sentences are as followspage  line  we confirmed the correct genotype of the promoter replacement strains using southern blot analysis supplementary fig s and expression levels of rnr rnr and rnr in the presence of copper sulphate cuso which suppresses the ctr downstream gene expression and bathocuproine disulphonate bcs which strongly induces the ctr downstream gene expression griffith and doering  yeast  we found that rnr rnr and rnr expression in pctrrnr pctrrnr and pctrrnr strains were markedly increased under bcs treatment but suppressed under cuso treatment fig a next we observed growth changes in the pctrrnr pctrrnr and pctrrnr strains in the presence of cuso or bcsfig d why did the wt control seem to have a growth defect when treated with bcs and  mm hu either explain or use a more representative imageresponse we understand reviewers concern because bcs is a cu chelator it can reduce the intracellular concentration of free cu several studies reported that cu is involved in the diverse stress responses and virulence in c neoformans chun and madhani  plos one e waterman et al  mbio  e ding et al  mol microbiol  cox et al  infect immun  therefore bcs treatment affects diverse cellular effects caused by the limitation of the intracellular cu as well as induction of genes under the control of ctr promoter furthermore the previous studies also reported that wt strains show slight growth defects in the presence of bcs compared to cu treatment or nonetreatment and the growth of wt stains is more reduced under both bcs and rapamycin treatments than under the only rapamycin treatment ding et al  mol microbiol  so et al  genetics  in agreement with these previous findings our data also revealed that wt strain showed slight growth defects in the presence of both bcs and stressinducing agents such as nqo and mms compared to the only stressinducing agent supplementary information therefore we believed that the growth defect of wt control in the presence of bcs and hu treatment was caused by the limitation of intracellular cu levelswe added relevant information in the result section of the revised manuscript and modified sentences as follows  page  line  the growth of wt and tested strains was slightly more retarded in the presence of both bcs and stressinducing agents than the presence of the stressinducing agents only probably due to reduced intracellular cu levels resulting from the cuchelating activity of bcs figure c and supplementary fig  this phenomenon is also observed in previous studies ding et al  mol microbiol  so et al  genetics   the abstract may further emphasizehighlight the novelty of the study what are the main difference comparing the findings with what have been reported in other systems including s cerevisiaeresponse we understand reviewers concerns in s cerevisiae the mecraddun kinase cascade mainly regulates rnr gene expression in the case of rnr ixr is involved in the induction of rnr expression and mbf which is a transcription complex composed of swi and mbp also controls rnr gene expression notably ixr and mbf are controlled by rad tsaponina et al plos genetics   e de brun ra et al molecular cell   sidorova and breeden molecular and cellular biology  however in c neoformans chk rather than rad mainly regulated rnr expression although mbs which is an mbp and swilike protein  controlled rnr expression during dna replication stress like s cerevisiae in the case of rnr rnr and rnr expressions the crt transcription factor suppresses their expression levels in response to dna replication stress crt is dissociated from the promoter of rnr genes through the dunmediated phosphorylation process given that crt forms a corepressor complex with tupssn the expression levels of rnr rnr and rnr in tup and ssn mutants were higher than those in wt zhou and elledge genetics   huang et al cell   li and reese journal of biological chemistry   bing and reese the embo journal    in c neoformans mbs is also involved in the expression levels of rnr and rnr an ortholog of scrnr in contrast to crt in s cerevisiae the bdr transcription factor played a role in controlling rnr expression as an activator in c neoformans notably the ssntup complex in c neoformans mainly suppressed expression levels of rnr which is an ortholog of scrnr but not rnr and rnr in the discussion section page  line  we already described the main difference in rnr regulation in c neoformans compared to the previous findings in other yeasts including s cerevisiae in the original manuscript     as the reviewers suggestion we modified the abstract in the revised manuscript and modified sentences as followspage  line  a balance in deoxyribonucleotide dntps intracellular concentration is critical for dna replication and repair processes in the model yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae the mecraddun kinase cascade mainly regulates ribonucleotide reductase rnr gene expression during dna replication and dna damage stress however rnr regulatory mechanism in basidiomycete fungi during dna replication and damage stress remains elusive here we found that in c neoformans rnr large rnr subunit and rnr one small rnr subunit are required for cell viability but not rnr another small rnr subunit rnr overexpression compensated for the lethality of rnr suppression in contrast to the regulatory mechanism of rnrs in s cerevisiae rad and chk kinases cooperatively or divergently controlled rnr and rnr expressions under dna damage and dna replication stresses especially this study revealed that chk mainly regulated rnr expression during dna replication stress whereas rad rather than chk played a major role in controlling expression of rnr during dna damage stress furthermore expression of rnr but not rnr and rnr was suppressed by the ssntup complex during dna replication stress whereas ssn but not tup promotes induction of rnr and rnr notably we found that rnr expression was mainly regulated by mbs whereas rnr expression was cooperatively controlled by mbs and bdr as downstream factors of rad and chk during dna replication and damage stresses in addition perturbation of rnr expression but not rnr affects resistance to dna replication and dna damage stress collectively the regulation of rnrs in c neoformans has evolutionarily conserved and divergent features in dna replication and dna damage stress compared to other yeastsreviewer  comments for the authorin the manuscript essential roles of ribonucleotide reductases under dna damage and replication stresses in cryptococcus neoformans the authors characterize deletion mutants of the rnr genes of c neoformans investigate their expression in response to replication stress and define upstream pathways that regulate rnr gene expression the experiments are welldesigned and the conclusions are generally supported by the data there are a few minor points that could help with clarity initial characterization of rnr genes and expression in cn was published in  doi sy and the naming scheme is a bit different the authors should either adopt or reconcile these names for clarity in the fieldresponse we agree we changed rnr and rnr to rnr and rnr respectively in the revised manuscript and figures due to the overlap in the previous study we deleted identification of rnr genes in c neoformans and expression of rnr rnr and rnr in figure a furthermore we modified role of rnr genes in c neoformans viability in the result section of the revised manuscript the modified sentences are as follows page  line  role of rnr genes in c neoformans viability scrnr genes including rnr and rnr and c albicans rnr are essential for viability    the previous study reveals that c neoformans has one homolog of rnr encoding a rnr large subunit and two homologous genes rnr and rnr encoding rnr small subunits zulkifli et al  mycopathologia  to address whether cnrnr cnrnr and cnrnr are essential for survival we constructed conditional rnr rnr and rnr expression strains y replacing each native promoter with a copperregulated ctr promoter pctr upstream of the atg start codon or the utr of the rnr rnr and rnr genes supplementary fig spage  line  given that the rnr and rnr expressions are induced in c neoformans and the expression levels of rnr rnr and rnr are regulated by rad kinases under dna replication stress in s cerevisiae zulkifli et al  mycopathologia  huang and elledge  molecular and cellular biology  we measured the expression levels of rnr genes under hu treatment in the wt and rad mutant strainspage  line  fig  expression levels of rnr rnr and rnr under hu treatment a expression of rnr and rnr was regulated by both rad and chk b ssntup complex suppressed rnr expression quantitative rtpcr analysis was performed using cdna synthesized from total rna isolated from wt h rad chk ssn tup and rad chk double mutant treated with hu  mm three independent biological samples were analyzed with duplicate technical replicates error bars indicate standard errors of the means s e m  p    p    p   and ns nonsignificant c the ssn and tup mutants were sensitive to hu strains were cultured in a liquid yeast extract peptone dextrose ypd medium strains were serially diluted and spotted onto the ypd medium containing hu  mm strains were further incubated at oc and photographed daily  in the text the reference to double deletion mutants is not very clear perhaps saying double mutant after the individual locus names or removing the space between the two deletion identifiers would help clarify lines  and  are an example of where indication of the double mutant would clarify the statementresponse we partly agree we added double mutant after the individual locus name as suggested based on the standard genetic nomenclature used in the cryptococcus field and other published studies we would like to keep the space between two deletion identifiers  there has been a lot of work in s cerevisiae looking at rnr dosage and the effects of mutations this may explain the rnr overexpression toxicity in figure e for example doi nargkvresponse we appreciated your constructive comments the effect of dntp production mediated by rnr on dna damage response and mutation occurrence has been elucidated in s cerevisiae the intracellular dntp is increased in response to dna damage stress chabes et al  cell  the perturbation of feedback inhibition caused by mutations in the allosteric site of rnr renders strains resistant to dna damage stress whereas it increases the mutation rate chabes et al  cell  watt et al  nucleic acids research  consistent with the previous studies chabes and stillman also reported that high levels of dntp concentration through rnr overexpression increase the dna damage resistance however rnr overexpression in strains deleted with gene encoding subunit of the origin recognition complex decreases viability chabes and stillman  pnas  these data indicate that high levels of dntp mediated by rnr dosage or rnr mutation have divergent effects in a genetic backgrounddependent manner therefore rnr overexpression might have a deleterious effect on the mbs mutant we added and modified relevant information in the result and discussion sections in the revised manuscriptpage  line  we hypothesized that overexpression of rnr could restore the hu resistance of the mbs mutant due to the following reasons first the induction of rnr but not rnr was significantly lowered in the mbs mutant compared to the wt in c neoformans second overexpression of rnr increases the resistance to dna damage stress in s cerevisiae chabes and stillman  pnas  page  line  these data indicate that other factors also contribute to hu resistance of the mbs mutant page  line  in s cerevisiae mutation of allosteric sites of rnr results in high levels of dntp production which renders strains resistant to dna damage stress and leads to high frequency of mutation rates chabes et al  cell  watt et al  nucleic acids research  notably the effect of rnr overexpression varies depending on a genetic background rnr overexpression increases resistance to dna damage stress in wt chabes and stillman  pnas  and suppresses the lethality in rad and mec mutants desany et al  genes and development  however rnr overexpression in strains deleted with gene encoding subunit of the replication origin recognition complex decreases viability chabes and stillman  pnas  in c neoformans rnr overexpression in wt did not increase dna damage resistance however rnr overexpression in the mbs mutant increased dna damage sensitivity this might result from the genetic instability caused by high mutation rates or other reasons at this point we need to further elucidate how rnr expression affects dna damage response in diverse genetic backgrounds of c neoformans the authors conclude that an enhancer outside of the locus may be driving expression in response to replication stress because the h and ctr promoterswap strains are both induced by replication stress posttranscriptional regulation of the rnr mrnas is also possible also are the native h and ctr promoters at their native loci induced by replication stressresponse we apologized for the confusing wording based on figure a rnr expression in h promoterswap strains was induced in response to replication stress as the reviewer suggested we measured expression levels of h gene in the presence and absence of hu by qrtpcr analysis to check whether this gene is induced under replication stress we found that expression levels of h gene were not significantly changed during dna replication stress please see the attached images as below  page  line  interestingly however hu treatment further increased expression of rnr in the phrnr strain fig a implying that an enhancer out of the replaced rnr promoter region or unknown factors may act on the humediated induction because the h promoter per se was not induced under replication stress data not shown, response to reviewers comments response we agree we deleted the corresponding sentence as follows   response we agree we modified the corresponding sentence as follows  line  a conclusion

to investigate the effectiveness of physiotherapy instrument mobilization pim in patients with lbp methods thirtytwo participants with lbp were randomly assigned to one of two groups pim group received lumbar mobilisation technique using an activator instrument stabilisation exercises or and education and the manual group received lumbar mobilisation technique using a pisiform grip

andor lumbar multifidus muscle activation percentage thickness change  cm activation ratio  cm conclusion both methods of lumbar spine mobilization demonstrated comparable improvements in pain and disability in patients with lbp with no superiority of one method over the other low back pain lbp affects around twothird of adults throughout their lifespan  it is one of the most common conditions affecting the musculoskeletal system  the prevalence of lumbar spine disorders was reported  to be  in saudi arabia and the most common disorder was lbp   nonspecific lbp nlbp is defined as lbp without a specific pathoanatomical cause  it is considered the most common type of lbp with a lifetime prevalence of   most patients with lbp present with moderate to severe pain that results in moderate to high disability  other clinical features related to lbp are altered trunk muscle activation  and reduction in the range of motion rom  lbp is mainly managed with either surgical or conservative treatment physical therapy has an important role in lbp management as one of the conservative managements several clinical practice guidelines have recommended the use of joint mobilization techniques to lumbar spine to reduce pain and improve function in patient with acute or chronic lbp  although sometimes used interchangeably joint mobilization techniques can be categorized into highvelocity thrust techniques typically called manipulation or spinal adjustment and slowvelocity nonthrust techniques physical therapists tend to use instruments to provide joint mobilization techniques  instruments or activators allow the therapist to be more specific in joints targeting and reach deep in the tissues with minimum stress and workrelated injuries on therapists hand  a systematic review reported that activator adjustment instrument provided comparable clinically meaningful improvements to patients with spinal pain when compared to manual manipulation  this review however found and reviewed only eight clinical trials none of them were an rctalthough used for joint manipulation techniques it has been claimed that an activator adjusting instrument socalled physiotherapy instrument mobilization pim can be used to provide effective efficient and safe joint mobilization techniques  though to our knowledge studies on the use of pim an activator instrument as a mobilization technique are lacking therefore the current study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of pim as compared with manual mobilization in patients with lbp we tested the hypothesis

former the available rom was quantified by subtracting the lower inclinometer reading from the upper one the mean of three repetitions were calculated lumbar multifidus muscle activation an ultrasound device logiq r ge medical systems co jiangsu china with a  mhz curvilinear transducer was used diagnostic ultrasound is a valid method with high reliability icc   to quantify lumbar multifidus activation  the amount of lumbar multifidus muscle activation was quantified by measuring muscle thickness during both rest and activation states in rest the participant was in prone with  pillows under hips to decrease lumbar lordosis the head placed in the breathing hole of the treatment bed and arms rested beside the trunk as the multifidus atrophy was localized rather than generalized and it most likely occur at the level of l and l  the spinous processes of l and l were marked the transducer was placed longitudinally at the midpoint of lumbar spinous processes of l and l then moved laterally to both sides right then left during activation lumbar multifidus thickness was measured using contralateral arm lift the participant was in prone with  pillows under hips with both upper limbs placed overhead with shoulder abducted  and elbow flexed  th participant raised the contralateral arm from the bed approximately  inches and hold it for  seconds whenever a clear image was obtained in both rest and activation it was saved to be measured later using onscreen callipers by the independent assessor  three images were taken in each position rest and activation and the mean of the three images was used for analysis lumbar multifidus thickness was measured by a vertical line from the thoracolumbar fascia to the facet joint at the level of l figure  lumbar multifidus activation was measured by two methods which both were considered as an indicator of muscle activation for lumbar multifidus percentage thickness change was calculated by using the following equation thickness activity thickness rest thickness rest   in addition muscle contraction ratio was measured by using the following equation thickness activity thickness rest  the data analysis was done using spss statistics software version  ibm new york usa shapirowilk test was performed to test for normality of the data the data were normally distributed the analysis was performed on an intentiontotreat basis linear mixedmodel lmm was used to compare difference of means between both groups for all continuous variables nprs ppt rom and lumbar multifidus activation to assess the groupbytime interaction

using pim as a mobilization technique and compare it with manual mobilization in patients with lbp our results demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in pain and disability in both the manual group and the pim group however no differences were found between the groupsthe decrease in pain intensity as measured by nprs was more than the minimal detectable change mdc of  points in both groups  this is consistent with an rct by esplpez et al  on  patients with lbp which found immediate improvement in pain perception the authors  suggested that articular spinal mobilization is an effective method to decrease pain intensity and increase lumbar comfort in patients with lbp a recent systematic review reviewed the effect of spinal mobilization alone on patients with lbp and highly recommended its use to decrease pain and improve function in shortterm  on the other hand a more recent systematic review found decrease in pain in favor of spinal mobilization compared with sham treatment but this decrease was not clinically meaningful  these findings were different to our findings which may be due to the heterogeneousness of sham treatments used in these studies the improvement in pain in our study using spinal mobilization may be explained by several mechanisms these mechanisms include alteration of sensory information inflow to the central nervous system stimulation of the primary afferent neurons in golgi tendon and muscle spindles as well as small sensory nerve fibers increase in the field of the central neuron receptors decrease in the motor excitability and facilitation of the sympathetic neurons  our study revealed that disability due to lbp as measured by odi improved in both the manual group    and pim group    however no difference was found between both groups the decrease in disability was more than the mdc of  in both groups  previous systematic reviews demonstrated that spinal mobilization improved function in patients with lbp the findings of this study revealed no differences in the ppt between both groups however inconsistent improvements were observed in the back for the pim group  kgcm and in the tibialis anterior for the manual group  kgcm the decrease in pain sensitivity was more than the mdc of  kgcm  studies on the effects of spinal mobilization on ppt in patients with lbp are scarce however few studies have investigated the effect of spinal manipulation on ppt in these patients and demonstrated increase in ppt  an article which reviewed  studies found that spinal mobilization increased ppt in asymptomatic participants and in patients with different musculoskeletal conditions other than lbp  the inconsistency in the findings of the effect of spinal mobilization on ppt may be attributed to the differences in research methodology between the studies and to the interchangeable use of the terms mobilization and manipulation although they are two different techniques pentelka et al  suggested a minimum  sets of    seconds of lumbar spine mobilization in order to produce a difference in ppt in asymptomatic population however karas et al  in their comprehensive review reported that lumbar mobilization increases ppt and reduces pain sensitivity regardless of the duration rate or amplitude in the current study only  sets of  repetitions of mobilization were provided for both groups  the current study found no differences in lumbar spine rom between both groups the only improvement in rom was observed in flexion in the pim group  which was more than the mdc of   the authors of the current study were not able to explain this improvement no improvement was found in the extension or lateral flexion a recent systematic review found conflicting results about the effect of spinal mobilization on lumbar rom in patients with lbp  the authors of this review reported that three out of four reviewed studies found withingroup improvement in almost all movements as measured by fingertofloor method although this improvement did not reach the mdc of  cm moreover no significant differences were found between groups in any of the reviewed studies  notably the only trial with a true control group found no statistically significant improvement in rom in both within and betweengroups  the no change in rom may be due to mobilization dose grade number of sets rate and frequency of the mobilization force as it may affect rom changes in various planes of back movement  it is also probable that lumbar spine rom could be increased after manual therapy but could not be detected through the method used to measure this range in our study rom was measured by using dual inclinometer method whereas most of the previous studies measured the trunk flexibility by using fingertiptofloor method in this study we used percentage thickness change  and contraction ratio  to evaluate the effect of lumbar spinal mobilization on the activation of lumbar multifidus muscle the results revealed no differences between both groups in either method although there was an improvement in percentage thickness change of lumbar multifidus within both groups   this change did not reach the mdc of    however our values of percentage thickness change were relatively higher than the values in previous crosssectional studies  reliability studies  and a recent rct that investigated the effect of grade iii lumbar mobilization in patients with chronic lbp  on the other hand contraction ratio of multifidus muscle thickness improved in both groups and this improvement was more than the mdc of   previous research demonstrated a decrease in crosssectional area of the multifidus muscle and this atrophy was localized rather than generalized at vertebral levels  the change in the multifidus contraction found in our study may be attributed to the neurophysiological effects of spinal mobilization these effects include changes in muscle activity facilitated activity of peripheral nerves and modulation of the central nervous system the results of the current study found comparative effects of lumbar spine mobilization on pain and function by using either pim or manual technique in patients with lbp therefore therapists may select the technique that is appropriate to an individualized patient based on their clinical reasoning therapists may use pim technique if they are concerned about reducing the risk of their hand and wrist workrelated injuries  or use manual technique if patient comfort is indicated a strength of this study as an rct includes its ability to establish a causeandeffect relationship a limitation of the study was that a control group with no treatment a standard treatment or a placebo was not used thus internal validity of the study maybe questioned and the change in the outcome measures may be attributed to other variables such as natural progression of time however we attempted to minimizing this risk by several methods such as including identical standard treatment for both the pim group and the manual group using doubleblinding and randomly assigning the participants into each groupthe results of this study demonstrated that is a relatively short regimen of lumbar spine mobilization using pim or manual technique had beneficial effects on pain and function in patients with lbp neither pim mobilization nor manual mobilization was superior than the other in the treatment outcomes in this patient population as this is the first study that investigated the use of pim as a mobilization technique further controlled

simple observation to surgical release the purpose of this study was to determine the clinical outcome in children undergoing open surgical release and conservative treatment such as observation splinting and passive exercisematerials and methods data from  to  of  children with  trigger thumbs were collected the data were obtained from medical records to compare the final outcome between conservative and operative treatments the effects of age of onset sex affected thumb familial history treatment modality time to conversion from conservative to surgical treatment recurrence and complications were analyzedresults among a total of  children  children were excluded owing to loss during follow up thus  children were finally included there were  children aged below  months and  aged above  years range  weeks to  years there were  girls and  boys in all   children presented with bilateral trigger thumbs the right thumb alone was affected in   while the left thumb alone was affected in   children conservative treatment was administered to  children of which  patients experienced spontaneous resolution and  patients experienced treatment failure and were subsequently subjected to operative treatment no recurrence was noted after surgeryconclusion after  months of age operative treatment had better outcomes in comparison with conservative treatment which showed a higher failure ratepediatric trigger thumb is an uncommon anomaly the incidence is reported up to  cases per  live births at one year of age etiology is still unclear and controversy persists it is thought to be the result of mismatch in size of the flexor pollicis longus tendon and the a pulley an electron microscopic analysis found large amount of mature collagen and fibroblast without degenerative or inflammatory changes at the a pulley and the nottas nodulethe ideal treatment of pediatric trigger thumb is controversial the operative treatment is the release of the a pulley the conservative treatment methods are passive extension exercise extension splinting and simple observation several studies have recently been published in support of conservative treatment although many authors recommend that a pulley release is a simple reliable and definite treatment in a study  spontaneous resolution has been reported only by simple observationthe purpose of this study was to determine the clinical outcome of surgical release and conservative treatment in pediatric trigger thumbthe study protocol was approved by catholic medical center institutional review board vcresi to compare the final outcome between conservative and operative treatments a total of  children with  trigger thumb treated in one institute from  to  were consecutively enrolled retrospectively among a total of  children  children were excluded due to follow up loss thus  children were finally included treatment was performed by one pediatric orthopaedic surgeon the data were obtained from medical records to compare the final outcome between conservative and operative treatments the effects of age of onset sex affected thumb familial history treatment modality time to conversion from conservative to surgical treatment recurrence and complications were analyzed conservative treatment included passive extension exercise and periodic observations operative treatment was open a pulley release conservative treatment was done on children below age of  months or parental refusal of surgery above age of  months operative treatment was done on children over age of  months or parent wanting quick resolution under age of  months success of treatment was decided according to the recurrence at  year after resolution of the symptom verification of long term recurrence or complication of follow up closed patients was conducted through a telephone surveystatistical analyses were performed with use of spsspc version  spss inc chicago il usa continuous variables are expressed as average  standard deviations and noncontinuous variables are described as frequency and rate  the target comparison was carried out by kruskalwallis test chisquare test all data were considered significant when the pvalue was less than the age range of the children recruited to this study was  months to  years  children were under the age of  and  children were over the age of  the distribution of age over  was  children from age  to  and  children over age  female to male ratio was  to  with no statistically significant difference bilateral involvement in  children  unilateral in  children   on the right  and  cases  on the left  children  thumbs presented bilateral at initial and  children  thumbs presented unilateral but later on appeared on the other side in  bilateral cases one side spontaneously resolved and the opposite side underwent surgery these  cases were excluded from determination of outcome of conservative or operative treatment  cases had family history of pediatric trigger thumb  were twins table the treatment took up to six to  months conservative treatment was performed in  children  children were under  months and  children were over  months  were converted to operative treatment since conservative treatment did not show resolution of the condition operative treatment was performed on total of  cases with  thumbs  cases with  thumbs which were decided to take operative treatment at initial and  cases with  thumbs which were converted to operative treatment from conservative treatment all the operative treatment patients had no recurrence at  year after there was an overall success rate of conservative treatment was  operative treatment was  there were no complications during treatment or after treatment table conservative treatment failure for children below  months was  out of  for children older than  months failure was  out of  success rate for children below  months was  failure rate  for children older than  months was  failure rate table  as the age at first presentation got older conservative treatment is less likely to be successfulcystic degeneration of the flexor pollicis longus tendon was found in  of the  patients who underwent operative treatment the pathology showed myxoid degeneration and fibrosis in the case of cystic degeneration of the flexor pollicis longus tendon  cases were younger than  years old and  cases were older than  years old showing a tendency to increase as the children got older figure as treatment of pediatric trigger thumb operative treatment is a pulley release and conservative treatments are simple observation extension splinting and passive extension exercise operative treatment is performed if conservative treatment fails although many studies have been conducted comparing operative to conservative treatments the ideal treatment is still controversial in a study reported in  by dinham and meggitt among  patients thumbs operative treatment was done in  thumbs and conservative treatment was done in  thumbs in which spontaneous resolution shown in  thumbs in the study there were cases older than  years of age in which flexion contracture remained after operative treatment so it was recommended that operative treatment should be performed for children diagnosed after  years old in addition conservative treatment showed about  success rate which was quite high in our study conservative treatment was performed in  cases and  cases  achieved spontaneous resolution  success rate for children under  months old and  for those over  months old there was no case of remaining flexion contracture after operative treatment both studies had agreement on that as age increases conservative treatment alone cannot easily resolve the condition however skov et al observed  children thumbs who underwent operative treatment for an average of  months residual flexion contracture neurologic complications or scar related complications were not found even if operative treatment was delayed until over  years old han et al performed a surgery on  children thumbs with an average age of  years although the patients were older flexion contracture completely resolved at eight weeks after the operative treatment although the results were similar to our study in that there was no complication of operative treatment regardless of age cystic degeneration of the flexor pollicis longus tendon tend to occur when children are over age of  years or as the affected period of flexion contracture got longer suggesting the time of operative treatment should not be delayed on the other hand in  ger et al managed conservative treatment on  children thumbs diagnosed before six months of age for period of  months but was changed to operative treatment since spontaneous resolution did not occur as a result there was no residual flexion contracture and operative treatment was successful but it took longer for full range of motion recovery similar to our study concluding that the success rate of conservative treatment is low operative treatment has shown good outcome and operative treatment must not be too much delayed dunsmuir and sherlock reported that  have shown spontaneous resolution at mean of  months conservative treatment  children over  years old underwent operative treatment showing no residual flexion contracture with recovery of full range of motion so they recommended enough time on observation since there was no complication with delayed operative treatment lee et al reported conservative treatment by extension splinting on  children thumbs had  success rate superior to  success rate of simple observation a prospective study by jung et al performed only passive extension exercise on  children thumbs average age of  months have shown spontaneous resolution in  thumbs failure rate was higher in bilateral involvement with fixed flexion contracture watanabe et al had  spontaneous resolution in  children thumbs by passive extension exercise showing better results than simple observation by combining manual therapy they also devised a classification of trigger thumb to assess the effectiveness of conservative treatment on the other hand in our study most patients presented with stage  fixed flexion contracture on the initial visit the final result was considered success only when stage  normal was achieved as a result the success rate of nonsurgical treatment appeared to be lower the association between bilateral involvement and failure of conservative treatment was not statistically significant a study on  children by koh et al have shown  spontaneous resolution on average  months by simple observation and  spontaneous resolution on average of  months by extension bracingallowing passive extension of interphalangeal joint and limit metacarpophalangeal joint hyperextension this was the same result as the study by watanabe et al that the success rate of extension splinting was higher a prospective study by baek et al conducted conservative treatment on  children thumbs and  thumbs have shown spontaneous resolution only by simple observation supporting conservative treatment with simple observationthis was a retrospective study on  children  thumbs treated in a single institute by a single pediatric orthopedic surgeon the results of conservative treatment on  children  thumbs and operative treatment on  children  thumbs were analyzed which is a study with large number of cases were enrolled compared to previous studies in this study there were no serious complications residual flexion contracture no recurrence and high satisfaction in both patient and parent after operative treatment although there was spontaneous resolution by conservative treatment but the treatment period was prolonged and often followup gets lost or the parent does not want further waiting thus moving on to operative treatmentthere are several limitations in this study it was a retrospective study based on medical record and since the selection of treatment modality and assessment of result was done by only one surgeon and operative treatment was conducted regardless of age if the parent wanted there could have been selection bias further prospective randomized control trial studies on operative treatment and conservative treatment will be neededin children over  months old  operative treatment had better results compared to conservative treatment  conservative treatment was more likely not to resolve the symptom and  complications such as cystic degeneration of flexor pollicis longus tendon may result if treatment is prolonged or delayed therefore children under  months of age can be observed with conservative treatment for a certain period of time but operative treatment is a good option for patients older than  monthsfigure  cystic degeneration of flexor pollicis longus tendon a total of  patients underwent surgical release of the a pulley fifteen

Research paper_Journal article,ELSVR_79196.docx,Research paper_Journal article,ELSVR_79196.docx,experimental investigation on hydrate plugging formation in horizontal singlepass gasdominant flows hydrate plugging is a common hazard that threatens the safety in pipelines of the oil and gas industry previous experimental researches on hydrate plugging mainly focused on oil or waterdominant flows in this study the formation of hydrate plugging in singlepass gasdominant flows was realtime experimentally showed the results suggested that a sudden increase in pressure drop a sudden drop in temperature and in gas flow rate are important signals that indicate the formation of hydrate plugging as the subcooling increased the hydrate deposition ratio increased gradually the amount of deposited hydrates increased initially and then decreased and the number of sloughing events and the required time for hydrate plugging decreased significantly finally based on the research results the formation mechanism and early warning method of hydrate plugging in singlepass gasdominant flows were proposed the results of this study can provide a valuable reference for highsafety development of natural gas in the fieldgas hydrate is a type of icelike clathrate which is formed owing to contact between light hydrocarbon molecules and water molecules in processes involving conventional oil and gas development and transportation the hydrates generated in the production wellbore or transportation pipeline is hazardous this is mainly because the hydrates that are generated in the pipe can potentially block the fluid flow channel which would affects the safety of oil and gas development or transportation processes and can even lead to accidents many hydrate plugging accidents have occurred in different regions of the world such as the deep waters in the uk atlantic margin gulf of mexico campos basin of brazil and alberta gas field in canada hydrate plugging becomes an inevitable flow assurance problem during oil and gas development  therefore it is crucial to conduct indepth research on the formation of hydrate plugging under multiphase flow conditionsthere are three main types of flows in oil and gas development or transportation processes oil water and gasdominant flows for oil and waterdominant flows oilwater is the continuous phase and gas is the dispersed phase which is typically appeared in oil production and transportation processes and natural gas hydrate development for gasdominant flows gas is the continuous phase and liquid is the dispersed phase which is typically observed in deepwater gas wells gas transportation and natural gas hydrate development  for different flow systems laboratory experiments are important for studying the characteristics and behaviors of hydrate plugging formation in the multiphase flow process many studies had been conducted to research the hydrate plugging in oildominant flows  camargo et al experimentally observed the flow behaviors of hydrate slurry in crude oil and found the characteristics of shear thinning and thixotropy using a lyre loop device turner et al reported that the increase in fluid viscosity owing to the increase in hydrate concentration and hydrate aggregation dynamics was the main factor for controlling hydrate plugging via the exxonmobil flow loop dellecase et al song et al and chen et al experimentally showed the formation characteristics of hydrate plugging in multiphase flows a gradual plugging and a rapid plugging processes with corresponding plugging mechanisms  were proposed ding et al conducted multi experiments to research the characteristics of hydrate behaviors under different gasemulsion multiphase flow patterns and the flow behaviors of hydrate crystallization agglomerationgrowth deposition stabilization was proposed in oildominant flows majid experimentally observed that a rise in hydrate amount leads to a gradual increase in the pressure difference in the fully dispersed system but an evident increase in the pressure difference in the partially dispersed systemin recent years more experimental studies have been conducted on hydrate plugging in waterdominant flows joshi et al experimentally showed that the distribution of hydrate particles changed from uniform suspension to nonuniform suspension in the water phase under high water cut conditions by using the exxonmobil flowloop lv et al experimentally demonstrated that the accumulation of hydrate particles is the key factor that leads to the

usually occurs at the inlet under high water content srivastava et al experimentally determined that hydrate bedding increases the pressure drop reduces the fluidity of hydrate particles and increases the possibility of hydrate blockage the formation of hydrate plugging in gasdominant flows completely differs from that in oil and waterdominant flows and hydrate deposition is a crucial process for the formation of hydrate plugging  lingelem et al carried out a number of experiments to investigate hydrate deposition and discussed the possible mechanism of hydrate blockage formation in the gas

is lower than a critical value by using an indoor loop device sinquin et al and cassar et al experimentally studied hydrate formation in gasdominant system and investigated the effect of flow pattern on hydrate plugging lorenzo et al  and aman et al experimentally found that only a part of the hydrates generated in the flow can deposit to the pipe wall under low liquid holdup  in gasdominant flowloop  dzhuraev experimentally estimated the hydrate thickness based on the monitored pressure drop and gamma density in gasdominant systems under singlepass conditions and found hydrate deposition was faster at the bottom of the pipein summary although many hydrate plugging experiments in flow loops have been conducted in previous studies the research on hydrate plugging formation and early warning under singlepass flow conditions still needs to be conducted thoroughly in this study the characteristics of hydrate plugging formation in different flow parameters were experimentally researched and the influence of subcooling on hydrate plugging formation was analyzed then the mechanism and early warning method of hydrate plugging in gasdominant flows were proposed based on the experimental results the results of this study aid in laying an experimental foundation for research on early warning and efficient prevention of hydrate plugging in singlepass gasdominant flowsin the field of natural gas production or transportation the fluid flow in the production pipe or transportation pipeline is a singlepass flow condition therefore in order to be closer to the real flow conditions in the field the singlechannel flow conditions were chosen in the experiment the experimental apparatus used in the study is shown in figure  the apparatus mainly includes five parts the experimental fluid injection system experimental pipe section cooling system data monitoring system and camera compared with previous researches the experimental apparatus was used to investigate the hydrate plugging formation in gasdominant flowsduring the experiment the gas was supplied by a gas cylinder group and the liquid was injected by a plunger pump wherein both were mixed at the entrance of the experimental pipe then the mixed gas and water flowed in the pipe to form the hydrate the experimental pipe section corresponded to a transparent pvc pipe with an inner radius of  mm a length of  m a pipe thickness of  mm and its maximum withstand pressure was  mpa the entire experimental pipe was horizontally placed in a water tank in which the water was cooled thus the water tank acted as a water bath under the action of a refrigeration circulation system a mlong coil with an inner diameter of mm was placed in the cooling water to decrease the temperature of the gas entering the experimental pipe the minimum temperature required for hydrate formation in the experimental tube can decreases to  c a temperature sensor and pressure sensor were installed at both ends of the inlet and outlet of the pipe and a highprecision gas volume flowmeter was installed at the front end of the inlet to measure the gas flow rate in the experiment the measurement range of the temperature sensor was  c and the measurement error was  the measurement range of the pressure sensor was  mpa and the measurement error was  the gas volume flowmeter has a maximum flow measurement range of  mh and a measurement error of  the changes in temperature pressure and gas flow rate during the experiment were collected in real time via the data acquisition system every second and transmitted to the computer terminal the experimental apparatus was equipped with an hd camera to capture hydrate plugging images in the transparent experimental pipe to ensure shooting quality the camera was placed directly above the transparent pipe in the water tank furthermore control valves were installed in different positions of the experimental apparatus to ensure safe starting and stopping of the experimentto prevent a sudden drop in temperature resulting from the throttling effect as highpressure and highspeed compressible gas flowed through valve  which may have led to the problem of hydrate or ice plugging the pipeline at valve  was bent and placed in a bucket with  c water the experimental results showed that this method effectively prevented the hydrate or ice plugging problem caused by the throttling effect at the location of valve to experimentally simulate the hydrate formation and plugging in singlepass gasdominant flows the main experimental steps are summarized as followsvalves  and  were opened for injecting the experimental gas into the pipe and draining it to the outside air to ensure that the pipe is in the pure carbon dioxide state this ensure that the effect of the potential residual air and water in the pipe on the hydrate formation and plugging experiment is eliminated after discharging valves  and  were closed and the experiment was commencedin the experiment water was used as the cooling liquid the refrigeration cycle system was started to allow the water in the water tank to enter the refrigeration system via pipe  and the water in the refrigeration system entered the water tank via pipe  this ensures that the temperature of the water bath in the water tank decreases to the required temperature and then remains stable in the water bath the cooling process is lengthy due to the large volume of the water tank length  m width  m and height  mvalve  was opened to allow the gas to enter the experimental pipe through a mlong coil that can eliminate the impact of gas expansion cooling valve  was opened to allow the gas to flow under the pressure difference subsequently the opening of valves  and  were controlled to change the pressure in the experimental pipe when the pressure achieved the designed value the opening of valves  and  remains stablethe initial weight of deionized water in the water bucket was recorded and the data acquisition system was started to collect parameter data and valve  was then opened such that the water injection pump began to inject the deionized water that was cooled into the experimental pipe at a constant rate the method of injecting water after gas flow was used to prevent the injected water from entering the cooling coil thereby avoiding the formation of hydrates in the coil to ensure that hydrate formation and plugging only occur in the experimental pipeduring the experiment the gas flow rate in the experimental pipe and the temperature and pressure variations at both ends were recorded in real time via a data acquisition system and the recorded data were transmitted to a computer terminal in real time the process of hydrate migration and deposition in the pipe was recorded using an hd camera it was observed that hydrate formation and deposition occurred immediately once the deionized water was injected into the experimental pipe and thus the monitored parameters changed accordingly in the experiment the fluid flowing to the outlet end of the loop was directly discharged into the air as opposed to circulating in the loop which was adopted in previous experimentsas hydrate continuously forms and deposits in the pipe the experiment ended with the occurrence of hydrate plugging after a certain amount of time subsequently valve  was closed immediately to avoid continuous injection of water into the experimental pipe after the experiment then the water injection pump was shut down and the weight of the remaining water in the water bucket was recorded after stopping the experiment valves  and  were closed to stop gas injection after the hydrates in the pipe were completely decomposed valve  was opened to allow the gas to continuously flow into the pipe to drain the water out of the pipe meanwhile a container was placed at the outlet of the pipe to collect the drained water the water in the container was weighed to calculate the mass of hydrates deposited in the pipe according to the chemical equation of hydrate decompositioncarbon dioxide hydrate exhibits similar characteristics to those of methane hydrate the requirements for methane hydrate formation are harsher that is the formation of methane hydrate requires higher pressure or lower temperature therefore to ensure safety and easier development of the experiment carbon dioxide hydrate was selected as the research object in this study highpurity carbon dioxide purity   provided by yantai deyi gas company was used in the experiment which may not apply to the industrial practice but it can also be used to reveal the characteristics and mechanism of hydrate plugging formation the experimental liquid is deionized water which was processed in a laboratory ultrapure water machine the experimental gas and water were cooled prior to entering the experimental pipe in the process of gas and water flow hydrates were formed under conditions of low temperature and high pressure furthermore hydrates were continuously deposited on the wall to block the flow passage in this work eight groups of hydrate plugging experiments were performed under different conditions in order to ensure the accuracy of the experimental results three repeated experiments were carried out in each group experiment the detailed experimental conditions and results of each group of experiments are listed in table  in the table the average pressure and average subcooling are the average values at the frontend and the backend points of the experimental pipe section under the conditions that satisfy the temperature and pressure for hydrate formation type i hydrate is formed via contact between carbon dioxide and water the reaction equation for carbon dioxide hydrate formation is expressed as followsduring the experiment the pressure drop dp between the two ends of the experimental pipe is a crucial parameter that denotes the degree of hydrate plugging in the pipe this is equivalent to the value of the frontend pressure p minus backend pressure p herein where dp denotes the pressure difference mpa p denotes the front end pressure of the experimental pipe mpa p denotes the backend pressure of the experimental pipe mpathe hydrate deposition ratio hdr in the experiment was obtained by recording the total amount of water mwt injected during the experiment and the amount of water mwh decomposed from the deposited hydrate in the pipe after the experiment in the experiment the injected water would convert to gas hydrate quickly due to the high subcooling of hydrate formation therefore little free water remains in the experimental pipe after hydrate plugging occurs which was neglected when calculating the amount of hydrate deposition in the calculation of hdr the total amount of injected water mwt is equal to the initial amount of water in the bucket minus the remaining amount of water after the experiment where hdr denotes the hydrate deposition ratio in the pipe dimensionless mwd denotes the amount of water decomposed from the deposited hydrate in the pipe g mwt denotes the total amount of injected water in the experiment g mwi denotes the initial amount of water in the bucket g and mwr denotes the remaining amount of water after the experiment is over gbesides the average water injection rate rwi in table  is calculated using the following equation the formation process of hydrate plugging in the experimental pipe was analyzed by considering the fifth experiment as an example figure  shows the variation in pressure and pressure drop in the pipe during the formation of hydrate plugging under the experimental conditions in the early stage the pressure drop dp monitored at both ends of the pipe gradually increased and it remained within a small range in the late stage of the experiment the rate of increase of the pressure difference significantly increased and thus the value of the pressure drop increased this was mainly attributed to the continuous occurrence of hydrate formation and deposition in the pipe this led to a gradual increase in the obstruction of the fluid flow a few evident abrupt changes are observed in the curves of pressure and pressure drop which are due to the sloughing of some hydrates deposited on the inner wall specifically seven times of significant hydratesloughing phenomena were observed in this experiment as shown in the black dotted circles in figure  the growth of the hydrate deposition layer was affected by the fluid shear force and adhesion force between the hydrate and pipe wall when the former is less than the latter the hydrate deposition layer is stable and continues to grow with continuous deposition of hydrates when the former exceeds the latter the hydrate layer is no longer stable and shear failure occurs figure  exhibits the variations in the gas flow rate and the temperature in the experiment the change in gas flow rate during the formation of hydrate plugging is potentially completely different from the changes in pressure and pressure difference the variation in gas flow rate in the pipe is mostly not obvius during the experiment it suddenly decreases only when the hydrate plugging degree is significant at the end of the experiment when the gas flow rate begins to decrease in an evident manner it decreases to zero rapidly furthermore the gas flow rate decreases to zero within a range of a few seconds to dozens of seconds this is mainly determined by special properties of the gas which are completely different from those of the liquid specifically gas exhibits good fluidity and expansibility and its flow is only affected when the flow channel significantly changes therefore the variation in the gas flow rate during the formation of hydrate plugging in the experimental pipe depicts the law shown in figure as shown in figure  temperature at the inlet t changes slightly during the entire experiment while the temperature at the outlet t significantly fluctuates the temperature at the inlet is controlled by the temperature of the injected fluid which remains constant during the experiment at the beginning of the experiment temperature t gradually increases which is mainly attributed to the heat released from hydrate formation in the middle of the experiment the curve of temperature t indicates that the temperature initially decreases and then increases several times at points a b and c on the curve this is mainly due to the fact that the hydrate falls off from the inner wall of the pipe which corresponds to the sudden decrease in the pressure difference as shown in figure  the throttling effect due to hydrate layer growth weakens after the hydrate falls off from the pipe wall hence the reduction in temperature due to the throttling effect weakens accordingly while the exothermic effect of hydrate formation still exists and thus temperature t increases accordingly at the end of the experiment the temperature sharply decreases and is even below   this is mainly due to significant plugging of hydrate deposition in the pipe this leads to a sharp decrease in the effective flow channel and this in turn results in a highly significant throttling effect that sharply decreases the fluid temperature the ultralowtemperature effect is more conducive to the formation and deposition of hydrate and thus hydrate plugging is subsequently very rapid the changes in the pressure drop in figure  and gas flow in figure  indicate that changes in the aforementioned three parameters correspond to each other during the formation of hydrate pluggingfigure  shows images of hydrate deposition in the experimental pipe at different experimental times as exhibited in the figure the hydrate was continuously generated with the flow of gas and deionized water in the lowtemperature and highpressure pipe the generated hydrates continue to deposit to the inner wall to form a gradually growing hydrate layer an increase in the experimental time leads to an increase in the hydrate layer thickness during the experiment some of the deposited hydrates fall off as seen in figure e this leads to the sudden decrease in the pressure drop as shown in figure  this is mainly because the shear action of gas flow which was exerted on the hydrate deposited on the inner wall increases as the hydrate thickness increases when the shear exceeds the adhesion between the hydrate and pipe wall the deposited hydrate falls off the pipe wall which aids in delaying the occurrence of hydrate pugging it is observed that the hydrate deposited on the pipe wall is not evenly distributed this is mainly related to the distribution of fluid flow field at different positions and properties of the pipe wallthe effect of subcooling on the formation of hydrate plugging in the pipe was further showed figure  shows the variation in the pressure drop at both pipe ends under different subcooling conditions the results indicated that the effect of subcooling on the pressure difference at both ends of the pipe section is significant an increase in subcooling decreases the time required for hydrate plugging this is mainly because an increase in the subcooling degree significantly increases the hydrate formation rate and then increases the hydrate deposition rate figure  shows the hydrate deposition images in the experimental pipe at the same time under different subcooling conditions evidently an increase in the subcooling increases the thickness of hydrate deposition layer under the same experimental time conditionsbased on the experimental data the hdr in the pipe under different experimental conditions is obtained using eq  figure  exhibit the variations in the hydrate deposition amount and hdr under different subcooling conditions as seen in the figure the amount of deposited hydrate initially gradually increases with increases in subcooling but gradually decreases when the subcooling temperature exceeds  c this is potentially because the sudden generation of hydrate is excessive and can easily lead to plugging in the pipe in a short time thus the amount of hydrate deposited on the inner wall decreases accordingly as the subcooling increases the hdr in the experimental pipe gradually increases when the subcooling exceeded  c the hdr increased rapidly although the final hdr was less than  this occurs mainly because of the increases in the subcooling which in turn increases the hydrateformation rate in the pipe this implies that there is even less or no free water remaining this leads to a more sufficient contact between the hydrate and inner wall which in turn increases the deposition on the inner wall of the pipefigure  variations in the amount of deposited hydrate and hydrate deposition ratio under different subcooling conditionsfigure  shows the time required for hydrate plugging and the number of sloughing events in the experimental pipe under different subcooling conditions it is observed the time required for hydrate plugging in the pipe gradually decreases with increases in subcooling specifically it decreases sharply when the subcooling exceeds   this corresponds to the variation in the hydrate deposition rate as shown in figure  the above analysis indicates that an increase in the subcooling degree increases the amount of hydrate formation and the hydrate is more quickly deposited on the inner wall and thereby highlighting faster obstruction to the fluid flow in the pipe furthermore less free water exists in the pipe and thus the adhesion force between the deposited hydrates and the pipe wall is stronger therefore the shear failure effect of the gas flow weakens and the possibility of hydrate sloughing decreases accordingly as shown in the figure the evident sloughing phenomenon is  times at a subcooling temperature of  c and it decreases to three times at a subcooling temperature of  c therefore the time required for hydrate plugging in the experimental pipe is naturally less under higher subcooling conditionsfigure  variations in the time required for hydrate plugging and the number of sloughing events under different subcooling conditionsbased on the above experimental results and previous studies   the formation mechanism of hydrate plugging in horizontal gasdominant flows under low gas velocity was analyzed as shown in figure  this mainly includes the following steps gasliquid flow hydrate formation hydrate aggregation hydrate deposition hydrate sloughing and hydrate pluggingdue to the low gas velocity in the experiment and the gaswater flow was stratified under this condition hence water flows along the pipe wall at the bottom of the pipe while gas flows at the top of the pipe as seen in figure a when hydrateformation conditions are satisfied gas and water are in contact to form hydrate particles which is closely influenced by the mass transfer process and the subcooling conditions after that gas water and hydrate particles flow together in the pipe given the existence of certain porosity and low density of hydrate particles some hydrate particles can move in the gas phase under the carryover of gas flow while the rest are deposited and adhere to the pipe wall to form a hydrate deposition layer as seen in figure b it should be noted that the distribution of hydrate particles in the gas phase was not uniform due to the low gas velocity during the flow process some hydrate particles may agglomerate to form larger particles which in turn also flow with the gas phase and other hydrate particles and are then deposited on the inner wall actually hydrate formation aggregation and deposition are successive and the three processes can occur simultaneously in at different locations the hydrate layer grows and thickens gradually with the continuous deposition of hydrates on the inner pipe the growth rate of the hydrate layer at different positions varies due to differences in fluid flow mass and heat transfer and other factors at different positions thereby leading to an uneven distribution of the hydrate layer meanwhile the hydrate layer deposited on the inner wall was subjected to the shear force of flowing gas when the shear force exerted on the hydrate layer at a certain position exceeds the adhesion between the hydrates and pipe wall the deposited hydrate is unable to stably adhere to the pipe wall so hydrate sloughing occurs accordingly this results in a temporary increase in the effective flow channel at these positions as shown in figure c furthermore this phenomenon can be determined by the changes in the pressure difference and temperature variations observed in the experimental results  with the continuous occurrence of hydrate formation and deposition the hydrate that falls off from the pipe wall may deposited again at the subsequent positions and even more easily deposited on the pipe wall at the subsequent position due to the large falling hydrate block the hydrate plugging phenomenon eventually occurs due to the disappearance of flow channel at certain locations as shown in figure d based on the phenomenon observed in the experiment hydrate plugging does not occur in the entire pipe which initially occurs in the part with the highest diameter reduction although flowing gaps can exist in other parts of the pipe the gaps may be filled with newly generated hydrates after a certain timefigure  schematic of the formation mechanism of hydrate plugging in singlepass gasdominant flowsduring the fluid flow process in oil and gas development and transportation it is crucial to provide an early warning of hydrate plugging based on the monitored data the experimental results and the above discussion indicate that monitored pressure fluid temperature gas flow rate data and camera observations can denote the formation of hydrate plugging in the experimental pipe during field applications if the fluid pressure fluid temperature and gas flow rate data can be monitored then the pressure drop fluid temperature and gas flow rate can be considered as key parameters in turn that can reflect hydrate plugging hence the risk of hydrate plugging can be denoted early by using one or more of the above parameters thus the dangerous situation of hydrate plugging can be monitored in real time based on this the following early warning method for hydrate plugging as shown in figure  is proposed given the potential hydrate plugging risk in field operations during the fluid flow process hydrate formation and deposition occurs when the monitored pressure difference gradually increases and the fluid temperature gradually increases a decrease in fluid temperature indicates that hydrate deposition is starting to affect the flow and has a certain throttling effect when the pressure drop decreases precipitately and fluid temperature increased rapidly it indicates that part of hydrates deposited on the pipe wall have started to fall off when the pressure drop starts to significantly increase the fluid temperature decreases rapidly and the gas flow rate evidently decreases it is indicated the beginning of hydrate blockage and corresponds to key warnings of hydrate plugging to effectively prevent the occurrence of hydrate plugging the corresponding hydrate prevention measures should be adopted prior to the appearance of evident signs of hydrate plugging the proposed early warning method can provide valuable references for hydrate plugging prevention in the fieldin this study a transparent flow pipe apparatus was constructed to perform hydrate plugging formation experiments in singlepass gasdominant flows the experimental results indicated that realtime monitoring of pressure temperature and gas flow rate in the experimental pipe are important parameters for reflecting the formation of hydrate plugging once the pressure drop increases significantly the temperature and gas flow rate drops significantly in the pipe thereby indicating that hydrate plugging would occur quickly and the safety reaction time was highly limitedduring the experiment evident hydrate sloughing phenomena were observed which was denoted by an evident sudden decrease in the pressure drop and sudden increase in temperature and it was also observed via cameras under visible conditions this phenomenon is an important process prior to the formation of hydrate plugging in gasdominant flows an increase in subcooling during hydrate formation gradually increases the proportion of hydrate deposition and the number of sloughing events and the required time for hydrate plugging in the pipe significantly decrease accordinglythe formation of hydrate plugging in singlepass gasdominant flows under low gas velocity conditions was divided into the following steps gasliquid flow hydrate formation hydrate aggregation hydrate deposition hydrate sloughing and hydrate plugging based on the experimental results the early warning method for hydrate plugging was proposed in this method the pressure drop temperature and gas flow rate are considered as parameters in turn that can reflect hydrate plugging

downregulated degs as shown in figure  the up and downregulated degs from the integrated data are shown in table we performed the go term and kegg pathway enrichment analysis of the obtained upregulated and downregulated degs identified in the combined microarray data set by using the r language the adj p  as shown in the figure a and b go analysis showed that upregulated genes are specifically involved in the terms of response to ifn and response to virus biological process mhc protein complex and collagencontaining extracellular matrix cellular component peptide antigen binding and actin binding molecular function the downregulated genes were mainly concentrated in terms of organic anion transport biological process and basic amino acid transmembrane transporter activity molecular function the enriched go terms and their corresponding degs are shown in table  the pathways and the corresponding degs by the analysis of kegg enrichment are shown in figure c and table  we can see that the upregulated genes were mainly enriched in pathways of epstein barr virus infection phagosome antigen processing and presentation viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor viral mycocarditis leishmaniasis allograft rejection graft versus host disease type i diabetes mellitus and autoimmune thyroid disease however there was no enriched pathway of the downregulated degs according to the adj pwe use the string database to construct the ppi network of the expression products of deg in pm minimum required interaction score  figure a after deleting all

lymphocytespecific protein tyrosine kinase lck and signal transducer and activator of transcription  stat have the highest node degree these hub genes can be broadly classified into two categories ifnrelated networks and loops with cd cd and lck as the main componentsbased on the cibersort algorithm we calculated the fractions of  immune cells in  muscle samples we used a heat map figure a to visualize the relative content of immune cells in each sample from the heat map we can see that compared with the control group the infiltrated cd t cells and m macrophages were increased in the affected muscle tissue of the pm group while the regulatory t cells were relatively low figure b summarizes the relative percentages of the  immune cells which allows us to understand more intuitively the distribution of immune cells infiltrated in each sample the immune cell correlation matrix diagram figure a shows that resting dendritic cells are positively correlated with eosinophils value   activated mast cells are significantly negatively correlated with follicular helper t cells value   the violin plot of the immune cells shows that compared with normal tissues cd t cells activated cd memory t cells follicular helper t cells gamma delta t cells m macrophages and m macrophages infiltrate more while memory b cells cd nave t cells regulatory t cells resting nk cells and neutrophils infiltrate less in the muscles of pm patients figure bfrom the ppi network we can see that cd is directly associated with both cd and lck cd has been reported to play an important role in several inflammatory diseases we found that compared with the control group cd in the skeletal muscles of eam mice was significantly higher in gene and protein levels p figure a and b in addition the immunohistochemistry staining also showed that the infiltrating inflammatory cells in the skeletal muscle express high levels of cd figure c by immunofluorescence staining it was found that cd and f were colocalized in the skeletal muscle of eam mice compared with the control group cdexpressing macrophages were significantly increased in the skeletal muscles of eam mice figure dwe used the psych package in the r language to perform correlation analysis on the gene matrix of the top  hub genes in the ppi network and the immune cell matrix and visualize these correlations with a correlation matrix diagram it can be seen from figure a that most hub genes are associated with m macrophages m macrophages cd t cells activated cd memory t cells regulatory t cells and resting nk cells previous studies have reported that cd appears to be associated with macrophage polarization we correlated the mrna levels of cd relative to controls with the mrna levels of macrophage polarization markers and as seen in the figure bh cd correlated with the m macrophage markers tumor necrosis factortnf interleukin il il the regulated upon activation normal t cell expressed and secreted factor rantes and the m macrophage marker arginase arg and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase  timppm belongs to inflammatory myopathy characterized by muscle weakness and myalgia although the pathogenesis of pm is still unclear the complex interaction between a variety of genetic and environmental factors may be involved in the occurrence and progression of the disease through immune or nonimmune mechanisms further exploration of the mechanism of pm will help to unravel the mystery of the pathogenesis of inflammatory myopathycurrently rapid advances in sequencing technology and bioinformatics enable us to explore the mechanisms of diseases at both macro and micro levels so far there have been reports of using bioinformatics methods to explore the pathogenesis of dermatomyositis dm juvenile dermatomyositis jdm and inclusion body myositis however there has been no research report on the use of bioinformatics to analyze degs of pm and explore its mechanism in recent years in our study we integrated gene expression profile data sets of pm from three specific groups gs gse and gse and screened the degs after go enrichment analysis the most significantly enriched projects related to biological processes were the response to ifn and type i ifn signaling pathways which was sufficient to demonstrate that the importance of ifn and the dominance of ifn in pm we found that the most significant enrichment items of cell components are the mhc protein complex and collagencontaining extracellular matrix previous studies have also found the presence of the cdmhc complex in muscle biopsies from pm patients in addition the basement membrane molecules including collagen iv were destroyed or increased in myofibers surrounded andor invaded by inflammatory cells in pm peptide antigen binding and actin binding were found to be the most significant enrichment items in molecular function the item of peptide antigen binding was enriched by multiple alleles of human leukocyte antigen that were related to iim susceptibility and actin binding proteins have been found to be crucial in controlling homeostasis signaling in immune cells especially b lymphocytes which is characterized by the production of multiple myositisspecific autoantibodies other significantly enriched items are related to immune receptors and chemokines there is no doubt that the diversity of t cell receptor repertoires or the newly emerged immune regulatory receptors are all involved in the occurrence and development of inflammatory myopathy in addition studies have found that the cytokinechemokine patterns that dominate in different iims may be different as well significantly downregulated degs are mainly involved in coldinduced thermogenesis organic anion transport and transmembrane transport activity however only a few studies have demonstrated severe thermoregulation deficits in muscular dystrophy with myositis mice and there are few studies on ion transport in inflammatory myopathy more research is needed to explore these factors in pmwe found that the kegg enrichment pathways of upregulated degs are phagosome epsteinbarr virus infection allograft rejection and graftversushost disease which confirms some clinical findings of rheumatologists in practice for example patients with chronic active epsteinbarr virus infection may also develop secondary pm or dm in addition some patients with inflammatory myopathy undergoing immunosuppressive therapy developed epsteinbarr virusassociated bcell lymphoma and most of the patients were relieved of the disease after the immunosuppressive therapy was stopped most clinical reports indicate that inflammatory myopathy especially pm is one of the complications of chronic graftversushost disease cgvhd after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation besides the incidence of myositis in the cgvhd population is higher than expected which indicates that both iim and chronic gvhdrelated myositis may involve the possibility of allogeneic autoimmune reactions we analyzed the infiltration of  immune cells in the pm muscle samples from the selected dataset the predominance of cd t cells and macrophages in the muscle of pm patients can be easily seen from the heat map or percentage distribution map depicting immune infiltrate which is consistent with the current pathological understanding of pm the violin plot shows that pm patients have fewer regulatory t lymphocytes infiltrating the affected muscles compared to controls which seems to be one of the characteristics of inflammatory myopathy notably previous studies as well as our study have found that gammadelta t cells and follicular helper t cells may be involved in the pathological process of pm besides we found that there were fewer memory b cells resting nk cells and neutrophils infiltrating into the pm muscles a comparative study also found a reduction of memory b cells in peripheral mononuclear cells of pm however the distribution and role of nk cells in different tissues of inflammatory myopathy is still controversial unlike our results the current study shows that the increase in neutrophils and the neutrophil extracellular traps are related to disease activity in inflammatory myopathy which may require more experimental studies to confirm the corheatmap seems to highlight the important role of activated mast cells in pm because of their close association with multiple infiltrating cells which is consistent with the findings of masaya yokota et alwe constructed a ppi network of proteins encoded by degs and analyzed the correlation between the top ten hub genes and the infiltrating immune cells we found that these hub genes were more or less correlated with the cells infiltrating the muscle and we speculate that these hub genes may play a key role in the pathogenesis of pm the activation of the type i ifn system seems to be a characteristic of iim studies found that the type i ifn regulatory genes isg mx irf and ifit were upregulated in the iim muscles in particular studies have shown that isg is elevated in the skin of mda positive dm patients and in the muscles of mda positive jdm patients in addition previous studies also suggests that the oas gene family rsad and stat may be key genes in the pathogenesis of iim jdm or dm and such a result was also found in our study on pm we found that stat is highly correlated with m macrophages studies have found that stat as a key molecule related to type  helper t cell response and macrophage activation promotes the occurrence of inflammatory myopathy by participating in ifnrelated signaling pathways which is also reflected in our ppi network in addition we found that cd is highly associated with m macrophages while cd t cells are most associated with lck as a nonpolymorphic type ii transmembrane glycoprotein and a highaffinity receptor for macrophage migration inhibitory factor cd is involved in the regulation of lymphocyte development dendritic cell motility and macrophagemediated inflammation a study shows that cd also appears to be the hub gene for sibm it is worth noting that no previous studies have emphasized the importance of lck in inflammatory myopathy as a nonreceptor src steroid receptor coactivator family kinase lck can regulate tcr signal transduction t cell development and t cell homeostasis changes in lck expression and activity may cause various diseases however whether lck plays an important role in pm remains to be explored notably as seen in the ppi network cd is the only molecule directly associated with both cd and lck cd is a complex transmembrane adhesion glycoprotein at first it was well known as an important leukocyte adhesion molecule and then there was a lot of evidence that cd is an effective signal receptor cd was found to play a key role in mediating signal transduction from cd or lck recent studies have found that targeting hyaluronic acidcd is also of great significance for regulating chronic inflammation and autoimmunity cd on immune cells is activated and binds to hyaluronic acid which mediates the adhesion between immune cells and vascular endothelial cells so that activated immune cells exude to the inflammatory site therefore the functional activation of cd on immune cells may be a marker of autoimmune or immune disease activity moreover cdv was found to contribute to the occurrence of gottron papules in dm by increasing the recruitment of local inflammatory cells the results of our bioinformatics analysis undoubtedly highlight the importance of macrophages in pm although some scholars have questioned whether inflammatory myopathy with abundant macrophage infiltration is an independent subtype through correlation analysis of the dataset and validation in a mouse model of myositis we found that cd is highly expressed in macrophages in the affected muscles of eam mice and that it may be associated with macrophage polarization existing studies have found that cd expressed on macrophages is associated with both proinflammatory m macrophages and antiinflammatory m macrophages moreover there are now numerous studies on the regulation of macrophage polarization by drugloaded hyaluronic acid nanoparticles targeting cd thereby influencing disease regression notably it was found that higher expression of cd in m seems to capture ha material more efficiently but lower expression in m favors better internalization it is impossible to ignore the value of activated macrophages in the diagnosis and treatment of pmdm based on our findings we speculate that targeting cd or cdbased nanoparticle therapy may have a therapeutic effect on pm by modulating macrophage polarization however it is clear that we need to further clarify the importance of cd in pm and the intrinsic mechanisms of how it affects macrophage polarization this study is helpful in understanding the role and significance of degs in the pathogenesis of pm these analysis results may help us enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanism of pm and provide a basis for related basic research in addition

ability to function independently is potentially profound in australia approximately twothirds of patients recover independent gait within six months poststroke kwah harvey diong and herbert  a question commonly posed to clinicians by patients families and other healthcare professionals is the likelihood of regaining independent gait versus remaining permanently disabled following the strokethe time at which clinical factors are assessed is known to influence the accuracy of predicting functional return veerbeek van wegen harmelingvan der wel and kwakkel  studies that have examined early predictors of functional recovery generally describe assessments made between  and  days poststroke in  veerbeek and colleagues  reported the two variables of independent sitting balance and strength of the affected leg within  hours as being  predictive of independent walking  months after a stroke when these skills had not returned by nine days poststroke the probability of walking independently dropped to  the ability to accurately predict functional outcomes early and in particular the likelihood of walking independently is pivotal in guiding discussions with patients and their families regarding outcomes evidenced expectations allow guidance of resource allocation tailoring of therapy within the acute and rehabilitation settings and facilitate early discharge planning the hypothesis underlying this study was that functional recovery of patients can be predicted by the veerbeek and colleagues variables however current practices related to endovascular clot retrieval

that  of stroke survivors who were followed up achieved independent outdoor walking at  months unlike previous studies our study did not identify lower leg strength and sitting balance as early predictors for independent walking following stroke smith barber and stinear  veerbeek van wegen harmelingvan der wel and kwakkel  this may reflect the increased utilisation of endovascular techniques smaller sample size lower attrition rate and the inclusion of patients with minimal poststroke impairment within our study   current stroke clinical guidelines advise prompt administration of tissue plasminogen activator tpa a thrombolytic drug within  hours of stroke onset emberson et al  wardlaw murray berge and del zoppo  for occlusions of large vessels of the anterior circulation endovascular clot retrieval ecr is also recommended goyal et al  both strategies aid reperfusion of salvageable brain tissue in acute ischaemic stroke and can lead to improved functional outcomes goyal et al  rodrigues et al  ecr in addition to standard medical therapy has been found to improve odds of a higher modified rankin scale by twofold compared with standard medical therapy alone goyal et al  in this study a significant association between receiving tpa and independent outdoor walking at  month followup was observed one third of patients received ecr  or tpa  in our study compared with  and  receiving tpa and  or no patients receiving ecr in the new zealand smith barber and stinear  and dutch veerbeek van wegen harmelingvan der wel and kwakkel  studies respectively the increased administration of reperfusion techniques within our australian cohort may have been responsible for a lower degree of disability measured within  hours and for the majority of patients achieving independent gait of note the type of strokes included in these studies differed veerbeek and collegues  included participants with ischaemic stokes of the anterior circulation while our study and smith et al  also included posterior circulation infarcts and intracerebral haemorrhages nevertheless investigation into the time taken to achieve independent gait following clot retrieval interventions is warranted and could identify a subset of patients who would benefit from early targeted therapy in the acute setting to accelerate functional recovery utilisation of neurophysiological and neuroimaging techniques could be considered in future work to increase accuracy in prediction of hemiplegic lower limb recovery stinear  transcranial magnetic stimulation tms is used to objectively measure the integrity of the corticospinal tract supplying the contralateral limb by stimulation of the ipsilesional primary motor cortex stinear byblow and ward  there have been positive findings with the use of tms in predicting hemiplegic upper limb functional recovery hendricks pasman van limbeek and zwarts a pizzi et al  van kuijk et al  with mixed results found for recovery prediction in the lower limb hendricks pasman van limbeek and zwarts b piron piccione tonin and dam  similarly diffusionweighted and functional magnetic resonance imaging has shown promise in predicting motor recovery further research is required to establish efficacy and accuracy in predicting lower limb recovery findings from this study suggest that sitting balance and mi leg are not sensitive measures of longer term gait recovery a comprehensive approach that includes neurophysiological and neuroimaging techniques early poststroke may generate better understanding of the degree of neurological damage and potential for neuroplastic recovery optimal time points cost and labour involved to include such techniques as part of routine stroke care remain uninvestigated  the reported incidence of falling  months poststroke is between  belgen beninato sullivan and narielwalla  harris et al  in our study one third of participants fell at least once despite the majority of patients achieving independent outdoor gait poststroke deficits are important contributors to falls weerdesteyn de niet van duijnhoven and geurts  in our study urinary incontinence mental health and hemiparetic lower limb strength  predicted number but not severity of falls managing functional tasks with underlying depression anxiety or urinary incontinence can increase demand on the central nervous system during walking wei liu chang and liu  wolf riolo and ouslander  this in turn may impair an individuals ability to adapt poststroke thereby increasing the risk of falling walking adaptability an individuals ability to correct for different behavioural tasks and environmental demands is critical to safe independent gait balasubramanian clark and fox  urinary urgency is a hallmark of the neurogenic bladder after stroke in nonstroke individuals urgency to void is associated with shorter step length slower walking speed and greater trunk flexion all factors associated with increased falls risk le berre et al  omae et al  previous work has found that patients who regained independent walking were unlikely to regain the ability to appropriately increase gait speeds and negotiate steps uneven terrain and the distances required to walk competently and safely in the community hill et al  lord et al  lord et al  neural control mechanisms of walking adaptability involve increased activation of supraspinal motor pathways which are commonly damaged following a stroke barthlemy grey nielsen and bouyer  these control mechanisms are thought to differ for the stepping and equilibrium components of gait balasubramanian clark and fox  forssberg  grillner and wallen  which are commonly assessed as measures of walking ability although this study found most patients regained independent outdoor walking reduced safety during walking was identified as a longterm concern  as our findings suggest urinary incontinence and poor mental health are predictors for falls future research should consider prompt identification and management of these issues within the acute setting poststroke furthermore inclusion of balance measures that comprehensively assess components of walking adaptability may provide a more accurate representation of an individuals ability to walk safely outdoors   a major limitation of this study was the low response rate at followup which may have biased interpretation of findings of interest however is thatno difference was found between groups at baseline and followup with reference to either level of motor impairment or the proportion of patients who received reperfusion interventions  loss to followup is likely to have been due to death postdischarge residential care placement or other change to living status accordingly the ability level of participants may have been overestimated remeasurement of the mi and the fac as well as validated balance measures at followup may flag falls risk or predict safe everyday walking at study design it was expected patients would be brought in for their followup assessments face to face however this was unable to be carried out due to changes in clinic space and unplanned staffing limitations the study did not capture whether participants were receiving ongoing therapy at the time of their followup phone call and therefore we were unable to draw conclusions as to whether this influenced walking ability as there is a high likelihood that patients who achieve walking with supervision within  hours will be independent outdoors walkers at  months the inclusion of nonambulators only may have been more useful excluding haemorrhages posterior circulation infarcts and patients with previous stroke would have created a more homogenous participant group with a clearer extrapolation of the effect of reperfusion techniques following acute ischaemic stroke overall our cohort is a true representation of stroke presentations that are routinely managed in stroke units given that the majority of stroke patients who return to the community will be ambulant bedside measures of sitting balance and hemiparetic leg strength collected early poststroke are less important than might have been expected physiotherapy should prioritise targeted multimodal interventions that expedite skills crucial to safe independent walking even in the presence of moderate to severe disability elucidation of the role of neuroimaging and neurophysiological assessment tools in the prediction of functional outcomes is warrantedwe would like to thank the physiotherapists

Research paper_Journal article,FKRTK_4.docx,Other,FKRTK_4.docx,the association between cognitive decline and activities of daily living decline in patients using longterm oxygen therapy a prospective observational pilot studydepartment of occupational therapy nishiniigata chuo national hospital niigata niigata  japan hwdnuhwacjpdepartment of occupational therapy faculty of rehabilitation niigata university of health and welfare niigata niigata  japanabstract cognitive decline is one of the causes of decline in activities of daily living adl it remains unclear whether cognitive decline in patients using longterm oxygen therapy ltot is associated with a decline in adl this study aims to clarify the association between cognitive decline and adl decline in patients using ltot using a prospective observational pilot study design year data was collected during outpatient recruitment in the department of respiratory medicine at the nishiniigata chuo national hospital subjects recruited  patients with chronic respiratory disease using ltot  patients who completed a year followup the results confirm that a deduction of the montreal cognitive assessment at year was associated with a deduction of the barthel index at year odds rate   confidence interval  p   which is based on multivariate logistic regression this pilot study indicates the possibility that cognitive decline in patients using ltot may affect the progression of adl declinekeywords lung diseases older adults longterm care cognitive dysfunction activities of daily living quality of lifelongterm oxygen therapy ltot is recommended as longterm care for hypoxia in patients with chronic respiratory disease crd with severe respiratory impairment  patients using ltot require adherence to ltot due to improved hypoxiarelated dyspnea in daily living  several studies have reported that patients using ltot had lower activities of daily living adl compared to nonltot patients with mild to moderate respiratory impairment  a decline in adl leads to dependent living further affecting quality of life and death  patients with severe dyspnea have difficulty performing activities  however the actual situation of decline in adl in patients using ltot with dyspnea is not fully clear cognitive decline is one of the common comorbidities in patients with crd  cognitive decline is thought to be caused by a change in cerebral perfusion due to hypoxia  patients using ltot with severe respiratory impairment are predicted to tend to cognitive decline with greater changes in cerebral perfusion than those with mild to moderate respiratory impairment  cognitive decline adversely affects functional dependence of patients with crd  several studies explain that cognitive decline in patients is associated with a decline in adl after  years  whereas these previous studies have not been validated in only patients using ltot cognitive decline in patients using ltot may explain the effects on the progression of decline in adl in addition patients using ltot may develop of decline in adl than patients with mild to moderate respiratory impairment however the association between cognitive decline and decline in adl in patients using ltot has not been investigated in a longitudinal study designwe conducted a prospective observational pilot study at year to identify the association of cognitive decline and decline in adl in patients using ltot this pilot study hypothesized that cognitive decline at year in patients using ltot was associated with a decline in adlthis year prospective observational pilot study was conducted according to the strobe guidelines  this study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of nishiniigata chuo national hospital approval no  and niigata university of health and welfare approval no  and performed in accordance with the spirit of the declaration of helsinki all subjects provided their written consent with informed consent prior to participation in the study the subject who had no history of diagnosis neurological disease and psychiatric disease was recruited from outpatients in the department of respiratory medicine at the nishiniigata chuo national hospital the inclusion criteria were for the diagnosis of crd as defined by the world health organization  the use of ltot for respiratory impairment and living with family exclusion criteria were missing death events of disease such as neurological disease psychiatric disease and orthopedic injury during a year followup depressive symptoms determined by a hamilton depression rating scale score of    terminal state and refusalthe baseline measurement was conducted in december  through november  and the year followup measurement was conducted in december  through november  measurements were performed by occupational therapy h a we measured the data as outcome exposure and covariates twice at baseline and  months later this study measured adl using the barthel index which is common in the measurement of patients with crd  the barthel index constructs on items of selfcare activities including feeding bathing grooming toileting bowel and bladder control dressing transfer using stairs and mobility  this total score of the barthel index is produced by a summation of the score of each item  minimum  maximum we define a decline in adl when the barthel index score is deducted by  points or more which is the minimal clinically important difference mcid between baseline and a year followup  this study was scored by interviewing subjects and their families  this study measured cognitive function using the montreal cognitive assessment moca which is valid in patients with crd  the total score of the moca ranges from a minimum of  points to a maximum of  points this tool measures cognitive domains such as visual cognition language attention memory executive function abstraction and oriented we define cognitive decline as when the moca score is deducted by  points or more which is mcid between baseline and a year followup  this study determined from a review of previous studies that the covariates included age and sex  type of disease  body mass index bmi  dyspnea  and handgrip strength  dyspnea was measured using the modified medical research council dyspnea scale mmrc  this scale consists of  grades and the highest grade is severe dyspnea we define as the exacerbation of dyspnea when mmrc is high at  grade or more which is mcid between baseline and year a followup  the handgrip strength was measured three times with the dominant hand in the sitting position of the chair data were calculated as the average three times this study used a digital isokinetic hand dynamometer model tkk grip d takei scientific instruments ltd niigata japan we define a decrease of in handgrip strength when it decreases by  kg or more which is mcid between baseline and a year followup  bmi was calculated by weight  height we define a decrease in bmi when it decrease by  kg or more which is mcid between baseline and a year followup we separated subjects into two groups without decline in adl or decline in adl with reference to the change in micd in barthel index scores between baseline and a year followup all variables were expressed as mean standard deviation sd or median interquartile range iqr or number  we confirm the difference in variables between the groups using the unpaired ttest mannwhitney test and chisquare test we compared characteristics at baseline and compared bmi mmrc handgrip strength and moca at baseline and a year followup furthermore we compared the number of differences the decrease in bmi the exacerbation of dyspnea the decrease in handgrip strength and cognitive decline using the chisquare test the association between adl decline without decline in adl or decline in adl and cognitive decline was confirmed by variables at baseline and a year followup by logistic regression

the cause of decline in adl on patients using ltot by longitudinal data at year the main findings of this study were that cognitive decline in patients using ltot was associated with a decline in adl at year by multivariate logistic regression analysis which was adjusted for covariates this pilot study suggested that cognitive decline in patients using ltot are possibly associated with a decline in adlto date the actual situation of adl decline in patients using ltot has not been fully clarified in this study  of the patients who survived using ltot had a decline in adl a year followup nonltot patients with mild to moderate respiratory impairment are  of the decline in adl a year followup  patients using ltot may decline in adl in a shorter period of time than patients with mild to moderate respiratory impairment patients using ltot are generally characterized by severe dyspnea severe dyspnea causes decline in adl in patients with crd  similarly this study indicates that it is possible that the severity of mmrc at baseline was associated with decline in adl in the elderly dyspnea gradually worsens with age  agerelated changes can affect not only respiratory function but also physical function these physiological changes associated with aging are an inevitable reality the exacerbation of dyspnea in patients with respiratory impairment requires an understanding of the effects of agerelated weakening of lung function and muscle strength  severe dyspnea in patients using ltot may be associated with the frail cycle of aging  therefore patients using ltot with severe dyspnea may affect their independent adl furthermore patients using ltot have been known to have limited physical activity at home by ltot devices and consequently be an exacerbation of dyspnea  the ltot devices adjunct tubing restricts the patients area of action at home this leads to an increase in sitting and lying time  this lifestyle with the ltot device may also be one of the reasons for exacerbation of dyspnea in patients with severe respiratory impairmentthe main finding of this study was that cognitive decline in patients using ltot was associated with decline in adl in general cognitive decline causes dependence on adl  previous studies explain that cognitive decline in patients with mild to moderate respiratory impairment leads to dependence during life making it difficult to selfmanagement such as medication or exercise  older adults living in the community in japan observed the cognitive decline defined by mcid in moca at  at year  patients using ltot may tend to be cognitive decline at year there are several observations of cognitive decline in patients using ltot in a year longitudinal study the risk of cognitive decline is recognized in patients on oxygen therapy although it has not been recognized in patients with mild to moderate respiratory impairment  antonelliincalzi et al indicated that they had a lower mmse score of patients using ltot after year followup compared to baseline  to date cognitive decline in patients with crd has been speculated to be caused by changes in cerebral perfusion with hypoxia  those previous study guess that hypoxia causes systemic inflammation and oxidative stress which lead to cerebrovascular disease  patients with crd patients with severe respiratory impairment have the potential to remain hypoxic regardless of the initiation of ltot  thus cognitive decline in patients using ltot may be caused by changes in cerebral perfusion with hypoxia in addition cognitive decline in patients using ltot is associated with poor adherence to oxygen therapy  we need for further investigation into the causes of cognitive decline in patients using ltotthe study was limited in several ways first these results must be interpreted with caution because this pilot study was conducted with a small sample size and a single center in the future this will need to be further explored in largescale multicenter studies based on the results of this study furthermore  of the subjects dropped out such as death and terminal state at year which was more than we expected this means that many ltot patients may have a poor prognosis at year in further studies investigating the associations between poor prognosis and cognitive decline in patients using ltot may be beneficial in healthcare in addition this study has not measured blood gas analysis of criteria for hypoxia therefore this study has not measured blood gas analysis of criteria for hypoxia therefore we were unable to clarify the cause of the cognitive decline that leads to the decline in adl in patients using ltot we verify whether hypoxia affects cognitive decline so that our claim is rigid finally this study was conducted during the covid pandemic subjects and their family were not infected with covid from baseline to  year of followup although the lifestyle of the subjects may have changed due to their infection protection behavior against the covid pandemic in this study it is unclear whether lifestyle changes affected physical and mental health and daily activities in the subject therefore the results of this study should be interpreted with cautionthis pilot study indicated that cognitive decline in patients using ltot was associated with decline in adl cognitive decline in patients using ltot may affect the progression of adl decline however given the small sample size caution must be used more research should investigate that we need a largescale multicenter study for generalization resultsauthor

issues in the study design and methods the reviewer recommends the authors seeking additional inputs from biostats imaging scientist and professional writersgenerally the statistical analysis plan of investigating association between various clinical parameters to a certain octa parameter is confusing so does the report of an ods ratio of response thank you for your important comment we agree with your opinion that the explanation for the statistical analysis is insufficient therefore we have revised the section entirely in addition the odd ratios  ci presented as  was corrected to a specific valuein response to your comment we have revised statistical analysis as follows and revised table  table  and table  original data are presented as means  standard deviations for continuous variables and as frequency percentage for categorical variables continuous variables were compared using oneway analysis of variance with tukeys post hoc test for normally distributed variables and the kruskalwallis test followed by dunns multiple comparison for nonnormally distributed variables categorical variables were compared using chisquared test or fishers exact test pearsons correlation was used to assess the association between retinal octa parameters and the year ascvd risk multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the independent factor associated with retinal octa parameter significant factors p in the univariate model except for variables reflected in risk scores were included in multivariate logistic regression model we used backward elimination with a threshold of p as the criterion for retention of a variable in the model statistical significance was set at p and all analyses were performed using spss software version  ibm corp armonk nyrevised data are presented as means  standard deviations for continuous variables and as frequency percentage for categorical variables first we performed analysis to find the most appropriate octa parameter that might reflect the cardiovascular risk study participants were divided into tertiles according to the year ascvd risk and the differences in octa parameters and clinical variables between groups were compared continuous variables were compared using oneway analysis of variance with tukeys post hoc test for normally distributed variables and the kruskalwallis test followed by dunns multiple comparison for nonnormally distributed variables categorical variables were compared using chisquared test or fishers exact test in addition pearsonscorrelationwasusedto analyzethe interrelationships between otca parameters and cardiovascular risk scores including year ascvd risk grace score reach score and timi risk score next we performed further analysis with the octa parameter that had the strongest correlation with the cardiovascular risk scores study participants were divided into tertiles according to the selected octa parameter and the differences in clinical characteristics between groups were compared multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the independent factor associated with selected octa parameter significant factors p in the univariate model except for variables reflected in risk scores were included in multivariate logistic regression model we used backward elimination with a threshold of p as the criterion for retention of a variable in the model statistical significance was set at p and all analyses were performed using spss software version  ibm corp armonk ny  most of the findings are on average size of the flow void area however the area is not calibrated on axial length more details should be provided in the method about how flow void is defined and calculatedresponse thank you for your comment we agree with you that calibration on axial length are needed to quantify octa parameters accurately however this study had a retrospective design and axial length measurement was not routine ophthalmic exams therefore no axial length measurements data were existed in this cohort  after rereview of medical records of enrolled patients we found that spherical equivalents of all subjects were fall within  d which might minimize the axial length effect  flow voids are areas where the flow signal becomes lower when the flow of choriocapillaris is measured by oct angiography in other words the flow void refers to the nonwhite part of the binarized image which can be thought of as the nonflow part of the choriocapillaris particle analysis with image j provides three basic parameters the number of particles the area they occupy and the average size of the particles after flipping the image while binarizing to see the flow void analysis was performed the choriocapillaris is very sensitive to the segmentation result please specify how the manual reviewrevision of auto segmentation result is performedresponse i agree with your opinion that the ccp layer is very sensitive to the segmentation result previous study reported that macular pathology such as soft drusen could make choriocapillaris signal reduction and segmentation error alten f lauermann j clemens c heiduschka p eter n signal reduction in choriocapillaris and segmentation errors in spectral domain oct angiography caused by soft drusen graefes archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology   in this study however we excluded the subjects with any retinal abnormalities and low octa quality by media opacity such as vitreous opacity or severe cataract which means that all oct images were nearly normal structurally also two retinal specialists dsk and yus reviewed all oct and octa images and they did not find any artifacts from these image data so we did not modify any original segmentation  we have added the sentences regarding the result of segmentation error in the result section as follows two retinal specialists dsk and yus reviewed all oct and octa images and they did not find any artifacts from these image data therefore we did not modify any original segmentation response thank you for your comment  we have changed the sentences in title of table  table  and table  response thank you for pointing out our misktakes we have modified the manuscript to show the full spelling of brain natriuretic peptide bnp in the first use of the bnp abbreviation we excluded the cases with any retinal pathology including drusen therefore we rewrote the exclusion criteriaoriginal the other exclusion criteria were as follows any retinal disease except diabetic retinopathy such as macular hole neovascular agerelated macular degeneration or macular edema of any origin a history of glaucoma recent within  months intraocular surgery or intravitreal injection and lowquality oct signal strength index  according to the oct manufacturer and octa images image quality  according to the octa manufacturerrevised the other exclusion criteria were as follows any retinal disease such as macular hole any kind of agerelated macular degeneration or macular edema of any origin or any stage of diabetic retinopathy a history of glaucoma recent within  months intraocular surgery or intravitreal injection and lowquality oct signal strength index  according to the oct manufacturer and octa images image quality  according to the octa manufacturer refractive error with the spherical equivalent greater than    diopters d section ophthalmic and octa examination could state as  degree instead of  mm scan then introduce the axial lengthresponse we agree with your opinion that  mm scan was not real scan diameter because axial length correction was not performed mm scan was a name of scan protocol of topcon octa machine used in this study however angle of view is also inaccurate if it was adjusted by axial length because we do not have axial length measurement data mentioned above we have changed sentences in the method section as follows in this revised version  the authors retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients with ami who underwent octa within  days of admission for ami according to the authors informed consent was waived by irb due to retrospective nature of this studyi have several questions on the real design of the studywhy was octa performed in the patients with very recent ami is it a routine practice in korea or in the authors hospital if so what is the rationale who paid for the octa was it covered by the korean national health insurance system or patients paid for it how many patients were included initially and how many were excluded by the exclusion criteriato me this study seems like a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data as far as i know theres no rationale for performing retinal vascular imaging as part of clinical practice in patients with ami so far no clinical benefit of octa has been proven in patients with ami thats why the authors of the eyemi pilot study reference  which is a very similar study to the authors study designed a prospective study and obtained the informed consent from the subjectsit is highly suspicious that the study protocol was made before the study period and octa was performed intentionally for the study so ethical issues can be raised if the authors do not clearly explain this issue id recommend rejectresponse thank you for your valuable comment we fully understand your concerns regarding the design of this study however we can certainly say that oct  octa exams of ami patients were not performed for research purposes we have created a flow chart to help you understand and added it to this revised version figure we also added the content of this figure to the manuscript we performed ophthalmic exams only when hospitalized patients complained of any visual symptoms and consented to the exams a total of  ami patients were hospitalized and received coronary angiography between january   and december   in our hospital patients who have not performed an ophthalmic examination because they didnt want ophthalmic examination during the time of admission patients who had history of previous coronary revascularization patients with endstage renal disease patients with atrial fibrillation were excluded from the data collected in this way we selected and analyzed people who met our inclusion and exclusion criteria so we decided to make such a report retrospectively this content was included in the exclusion criteria we performed comprehensive ophthalmic exams including oct and octa if patients had visual disturbance to rule out retinal diseases a topcon oct used in this study drioct triton can obtain fundus photography structural oct and octa images simultaneously in one session and ophthalmologists could make fast diagnosis during shorthospitalized period also our hospital has a bundledpayment medical system in south korea and the amount of money paid by patients is fixed according to the name of the disease acute mi registered at the time of admission therefore there was no additional cost to the patients for ophthalmic exams we agree with you that the evidence for clinical benefit of octa in patients with ami is insufficient we think the clinical value of octa is not an established state but a developing process there are some evidences that abnormal findings of retinal microvasculature are associated with cardiovascular risk monteirohenriques i rochasousa a barbosabreda j optical coherence tomography angiography changes in cardiovascular systemic diseases and risk factors a review acta ophthalmologica ee in addition octa also showed some evidence for future cardiovascular risk in various clinical conditions like previous eyemi study it was expected that clinical significance of octa for predicting cv risk could be added if the evidence of octa was shown in patient with acute myocardial infarction a definite highrisk group for cardiovascular diseaseoriginal this was a retrospective singlecenter study conducted at a tertiary referral center we reviewed the medical records of patients hospitalized for ami between january  and december  who underwent ophthalmic examination with octarevised this was a retrospective singlecenter study conducted at a tertiary referral center we reviewed the medical records of patients a total of  ami patients were hospitalized and received coronary angiography between january   and december   in our hospital patients who did not want take ophthalmic exams n patients who had history of previous coronary revascularizationn patients with endstage renal diseasen patients with atrial fibrillationn were excluded of  eligible patients only  patients were enrolled in this study after applying ophthalmologic exclusion criteria  this study was the data obtained from the examination performed to confirm the abnormal findings of ophthalmology before discharge of inpatients who wish to have an ophthalmic examination therefore only the patients with recent mi were enrolled if patients did not have any ophthalmic problem we did not followup please see the figure of author response   among the hospitalized patients only patients who were hemodynamically stable and could understand the clinical implication of the test were included    id recommend discussing the potential advantages and disadvantages of getting octa images immediately after ami within  days compared to getting octa in patients with recent history of ami several factors including possible hemodynamic instability the effect of recent treatment for ami on retinal vascular perfusion the potential selection bias etc can be discussedresponse thank you for your important comment we aimed to investigate the clinical implication of octa in highrisk patients by performing an acute phase evaluation in patients with acute myocardial infarction an important cardiovascular disease we speculated that the acute phase evaluation is more appropriate to investigate the hypothesis that retinal microcirculation reflects systemic microcirculation in addition hemodynamic instability can also affect retinal blood flow regardless of microcirculation dysfunction so only hemodynamically stable patients were included however as the reviewer pointed out there may be concerns that the octa finding may be affected depending on the condition or treatment of the disease in the acute stage and that completely different results may appear after the acute stage has passed recently it has been reported arnould l et al  influence of cardiac hemodynamic variables on retinal vessel density measurement on optical coherence tomography angiography in patients with myocardial infarction journal francais dophtalmologie   that there were no significant differences were found between acute phase and  months after treatment of acute myocardial infarction nor between the measured octa parameters and cardiac hemodynamic variables original this study has some limitations first is the retrospective nature of the study compared to a prospective study the accuracy and completeness of the obtained data were insufficient second we included patients who underwent ophthalmological examination therefore exclusion of unstable patients could have introduced a selection bias finally this singlecenter study comprised relatively small cases which may not be representative of all patients with amirevised this study has some limitations first is the retrospective nature of the study compared to a prospective study the accuracy and completeness of the obtained data were insufficient second we included patients with ami who were hemodynamically stable and underwent ophthalmological examination therefore unstable patients and those who did not perform ophthalmologic examinations were excluded which could lead to selection bias in addition the study was performed in the acute phase of ami so the systemic condition or treatment of the disease may affect the octa parameters finally this singlecenter study comprised relatively small cases which may not be representative of all patients with ami id recommend comparing the results to those of eyemi pilot study in detail also id recommend giving possible explanations for the differenceresponse thank you for your valuable comment eyemi pilot study reported that scp density measured on octa was associated with the cardiovascular risk profile but in our study vd in scp was not associated with cardiovascular risk profiles the reason for this difference is that this study differs from the eyemi pilot study in the measurement device spectral domainocta vs swept sourceocta and the scanning protocol differences    mm vs    mm the main feature of this study was to analyze the ccp layer of acute mi patients which the eyemi pilot study did not deal with  many previous studies have reported that choroid is associated with systemic status and may be a biomarker of systemic health according to the review of tan et al choroid could be affected by physiologic conditions aging diurnal variation gender diabetes hypertension smoking and systemic inflammatory conditions tan et al state of science choroidal thickness and state of health surv ophthalmol     in octa study some studies have suggested that there were the association between systemic diseases hypertension preeclampsia and hemodialysis and choriocapillaris takayama k et al  novel classification of earlystage systemic hypertensive changes in human retina based on octa measurement of choriocapillaris scientific reports   urfaloglu s et al  posterior ocular blood flow in preeclamptic patients evaluated with optical coherence tomography angiography pregnancy hypertension   shin et al  optical coherence tomography angiography analysis of changes in the retina and the choroid after haemodialysis scientific reports   therefore we think that the choriocapillaris measurements in this study was meaningful to identify cardiovascular risk  we documented the differences between our study and the eyemi study as follows in the original version  data on the associations between systemic cardiovascular risk and octa parameters is limited particularly previous data regarding the relationship between octa parameters and coronary artery disease were inconclusive arnould et al reported that scp density measured on octa was associated with the cardiovascular risk profile in addition zhong et al demonstrated that scp and dcp were associated with the presence of coronary artery disease while dcp was associated with the severity of coronary artery stenosis in patients with coronary artery disease however scp was not associated with hemodynamic variables in patients with myocardial infarction in our study vd in scp was not associated with cardiovascular risk profiles the difference from the study of arnould et al could be attributed to the difference between the octa device spectral domainocta vs swept sourceocta and the scanning protocol differences    mm vs    mm and the nature of the retinal blood flow the retina has the intrinsic ability to maintain blood flow in various situations called autoregulation in this study patients without retinopathy were examined and autoregulation of the retina worked normally and no difference in was observed in vd between scp and dcpracial differences may have contributed to the differences in the results of the two studies western in the study of arnould et al vs asian in our study  another possible reason is that  the proportion of diabetic patients differed  for arnould at al vs  for this study even diabetic patients who do not have retinopathy have vascular changes on octa kim yk an y  park sp intraocular and interocular difference in parafoveal vascular density in diabetic patients without diabetic retinopathy retina     therefore we belive that our study is the result of exuding the vascular changes caused by diabetics as much as possilbe ,  dear editor  reviewers    reviewer

heart failure including heart function response thank you for this comment multiple phenomena associated with hf have been implicated in the development and progression of sarcopenia meanwhile prior studies have reported that not only sarcopenia but also its components are associated with reduced exercise capacity sympathoexcitation and cardiac remodeling contributing to the progression of hf

Research paper_Journal article,HIKOT_6_2.docx,Other,HIKOT_6_2.docx,quantitative and kinetic singlemolecule analysis of dna unwinding by escherichia coli uvrd helicase  the graduate school for the creation of new photonics industries  kurematsucho nishiku hamamatsu shizuoka  japanhelicases are nucleic acidunwinding enzymes involved in the maintenance of genome integrity helicases share several helicase motifs that are highly conserved amino acid sequences and are classified into six superfamilies sfs the helicase sfs are further grouped into two classes based on their functional units one class that includes sfs  functions as a hexamer that can form a ring around the dna another class that includes sfs  and  functions as a nonhexameric form the high homology in primary and tertiary structures among sf helicases suggests that sf helicases have a common underlying mechanism however two opposing models for the functional unit monomer and dimer models have been proposed to explain dna unwinding by sf helicases this paper briefly describes the classification of helicase sfs and discusses the structural homology and the two opposing nonhexameric helicase models of sf helicases by focusing on escherichia coli sf helicase uvrd which plays a significant role in both nucleotideexcision repair and methyldirected mismatch repair this paper reviews past and recent studies on uvrd including the authors singlemolecule direct visualization of wildtype uvrd and a uvrd mutant lacking the cterminal  amino acids uvrdc the latter of which was used in genetic and biochemical assays that supported the monomer model the visualization revealed that multiple uvrdc molecules jointly unwind dna presumably in an oligomeric form similar to wildtype uvrd therefore singlemolecule direct visualization of nucleic acidbinding proteins can provide quantitative and kinetic information to reveal their fundamental mechanisms key words  proteinnucleic acid interactions protein assembly protein oligomerization enzyme function fluorescence microscopy dna replication repair and recombination are important mechanisms that ensure the genetic continuity of a species in particular maintaining genome stability requires not only rigorous dna replication mechanisms but also dna repair mechanisms that are necessary to maintain genome stability the dna repair mechanisms remove damaged nucleotides and mismatches that constantly occur in dna and are highly conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes  consequently their deficiency causes various diseases such as cancer neurodegeneration and premature aginga number of proteins involved in the dna repair mechanisms have been identified and subjected to structural analysis and models for these mechanisms have been proposed based on detailed biochemical studies on the other hand since it is difficult to understand the tertiary structures and dynamic features of these complexes consisting of many subunits it remains unclear how these molecules interact with each other and function as protein complexesthis paper describes the classification of helicase superfamilies sfs and discusses the structural homology and two opposing nonhexameric helicase models for sf helicases by focusing on escherichia coli e coli sf helicase uvrd which plays a significant role in both nucleotideexcision repair and methyldirected mismatch repair this paper reviews past and recent studies on uvrd including the authors singlemolecule direct visualization of wildtype uvrd and a uvrd mutant lacking the cterminal  amino acids uvrdc the latter of which was used in genetic and biochemical assays that supported a monomer model the visualization revealed that multiple uvrdc molecules jointly unwind dna most likely in an oligomeric form similar to wildtype uvrd therefore singlemolecule direct visualization of nucleic acidbinding proteins can provide quantitative and kinetic information to reveal their fundamental mechanismshelicases are enzymes that unwind doublestranded dna dsdna into singlestranded dna ssdna by using energy derived from nucleotide hydrolysis they are involved in dna metabolism including dna replication repair and recombination and are highly conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes helicases share similar amino acid sequences in several regions and these highly conserved sequences are called helicase motifs  the primary structure of these motifs underlies the classification of helicases into six sfs table  in addition the six sfs can be categorized according to the number of molecules involved in helicase functions sf helicases that encircle dna to form a ring structure function in a hexameric form   and sf and sf helicases function in a nonhexameric formsf helicases share seven helicase motifs i ia ii iii iv v and vi  and are further divided into three subfamilies based on primary structure analyses uvrdreplike piflike and upflike subfamilies  table  sf helicases are also characterized by their direction of duplex unwinding sfa helicases have  polarity whereas sfb helicases have  polarity the uvrdreplike subfamily members are almost always sfa dna helicases whereas those of the pif and upflike subfamilies are sfb enzymes and can act on both dna and rna superfamily  sf helicases are probably the best analyzed structurally figure  shows the

investigated for some sf helicases using singlemolecule measurements as presented in the following sections the sfa uvrd  amino acids molecular mass   kda consisting of the a amino acids  and  b  a

triphosphate atp hydrolysis table  this helicase plays a crucial role in both nucleotideexcision repair and methyldirected mismatch repair  data from past biochemical studies  have indicated that wildtype uvrd exhibits optimal dna unwinding activity in its oligomeric form maluf et al proposed a dimeric model based on the result that dna is efficiently unwound when the uvrddna ratio is greater than or equal to  in the dna unwinding assay  table  a singlemolecule dnamanipulation study conducted by sun et al using magnetic tweezers  also supported the dimer model for uvrd table  they measured dna unwinding by wildtype uvrd using magnetic tweezers and analyzed ontime as the duration of an unwinding burst and offtime as the time between two adjacent unwinding burst signals they concluded that two wildtype uvrd molecules bind to the dna to unwind dna since the offtime distributions consisted of two exponential componentsin contrast to conventional biochemical and genetic approaches which provide data on ensemble averages of a large number of molecules singlemolecule fluorescence imaging can observe the behavior of nonaveraged individual biomolecules in real time enabling the unraveling of their dynamics  yokota et alwe applied the singlemolecule fluorescence imaging technique to visualize single wildtype uvrd molecules theywe first improved the surface coating method with polyethylene glycol peg and succeeded in reducing nonspecific protein adsorption on the glass surface to  that of the conventional method  next theywe simultaneously imaged the associationdissociation of wildtype uvrd molecules withfrom base pair bp dsdna with a nucleotide nt  ssdna tail and dnaunwinding dynamics in the presence of atp using totalinternal reflection fluorescence microscopy tirfm thus theywe were the first to perform singlemolecule quantification of the number of helicases interacting with dna  theywe visualized cylabeled wildtype uvrd interacting with cylabeled dna attached to the pegylated glass surface via streptavidinbiotin interactions since cy was attached to one of the two oligonucleotides that formed the dna dna unwinding completion where the cylabeled oligonucleotide came off was monitored through the disappearance of cy fluorescence fig a theywe observed many traces with a multiplestep twostep or threestep increase in cy fluorescence intensity just before completion of the dnaunwinding process fig b and c the cy fluorescence intensity decreased nearly simultaneously with the cy fluorescence intensity decrease which showed that the wildtype uvrd dissociates from dna just after completing dna unwinding the traces with multiple steps demonstrated that two or three wildtype uvrd molecules participate in dna unwinding fig d shows experimentally obtained and theoretically predicted distributions one two and threemolecule models of the number of step changes in the cy fluorescence just before or after dna unwinding the ratios of the one two and threemolecule models were calculated based on the estimated number of cy dye molecules per wildtype uvrd the experimentally obtained ratios of the step numbers of the cy fluorescence changes agreed more with  the twomolecule model than with the onemolecule model these results thus supported the dimer model for uvrd other studies using singlemolecule fluorescence imaging which also support the dimer model for uvrd were performed using singlemolecule forcefluorescence microscopy or singlemolecule fret imaging table  and fig em studies using singlemolecule forcefluorescence microscopy simultaneously monitored the dnaunwinding activity of wildtype uvrd with optical tweezers as well as the number of wildtype uvrd molecules involved in dna unwinding by singlemolecule fluorescence imaging   studies using singlemolecule fret imaging detected conformational changes of single wildtype uvrd molecules and monitored the dna unwinding process of single wildtype uvrd molecules  lee et al visualized the translocation of single wildtype uvrd molecules onto stretched kntlong ssdna  fig e they found that wildtype uvrd monomer translocation was blocked at the ssdnadsdna junction and that another wildtype uvrd monomer bindingbinging to the prebound wildtype uvrd monomer initiated dna unwinding fig f the number of wildtype uvrd monomers was easily determinedevident from the fluorescence intensity of cy attached to the uvrd monomers fig g and h comstock et al visualized efficient dna unwinding byusing two wildtype monomers  they used singlemolecule forcefluorescence microscopy in which hairpin dna was pulled by dualtrap optical tweezers fig i they found that a wildtype uvrd monomer exhibited limited dna unwinding activity with a low pulling force fig j whereas two wildtype uvrd monomers displayed longdistance unwinding fig k nguyen et al showed by singlemolecule intramolecular fret imaging of uvrd monomers that the binding of a second wildtype uvrd monomer to the wildtype uvrd monomer which was prebound to dna shifts the b conformation of the prebound wildtype uvrd monomer to a more closed state resulting in the activation of helicase activity  they also showed by singlemolecule fret imaging of dna unwinding that dna unwinding was soon completed upon binding of a wildtype uvrd monomer to the wildtype uvrddna complex on a glass surface fig l and m the opposing monomer model for uvrd was proposed based on xray crystallographic structures of monomeric uvrd  and from genetic and biochemical assays in which the cterminal  amino acid deletion mutant uvrdc was used mechanic et al   proposed a monomer model through integratingbased on the following observations i geneticcomplementation assays using a strain lacking the uvrd gene showed that uvrdc complemented the loss of uvrd and was competent to perform both nucleotideexcision repair and methyldirected mismatch repair in cells ii examination of selfinteraction between uvrdc molecules with a yeast twohybrid system indicated that uvrdc was unable to dimerize iii the molecular mass corresponding to dimeric uvrdc was not detected by sedimentation experiments iv uvrd c could be eluted as a single peak that corresponded to a monomer by size exclusion chromatography and v ssdnabinding ssdnastimulated atpase and dnaunwinding activities of uvrdc were almost equivalent to that of  wildtype uvrd in vitro table  summarizes the experimental methods and results of these studiesuvrdc lacks  amino acids in the cterminal region but all helicase motifs in the four structural domains are intact many studies have indicated that the cterminus plays essential roles in nucleic acid binding for many proteins with helicase and dimerization activities and the role of the cterminus has been wellstudied for sf deadbox helicases  several studies have reported the effect of longer cterminal amino acid deletion on the function of uvrd uvrdc uvrdc or uvrdc   uvrdc and uvrdc were not able to mediate dna repair in vivo uvrdc showed slightly reduced ssdnabinding affinity whereas uvrdc exhibited a reduced ssdnabinding affinity the ssdnabinding activity coincided with the atpase and dnaunwinding characteristics thus uvrdc retained atpase and dnaunwinding abilities whereas uvrdc lost these abilities the uvrdc mutant lacked both the unstructured cterminus and a part of the conserved a domain thus revealing that the a domain is crucial for uvrd function in addition the length of the remaining unstructured cterminal region is probably related to the dnaunwinding activity maluf et al suggested that uvrdc is possibly dimerized as they provided data that uvrdc could dimerize which was obtained by analyticalsedimentationequilibriumultracentrifugation experiments  however the dimerization equilibrium constant was  times lower than that of the wildtype uvrd table  summarizes the effects of deleting cterminal amino acids from uvrd on its function and oligomerization statesince the monomer model for uvrd was proposed using uvrdc singlemolecule direct visualization of fluorescently labeled uvrdc was performed  to address the question of whether multiple uvrdc molecules are involved in dna unwinding similar to wildtype uvrd an bp dsdna with a nt  ssdna tail the same dna substrate used in the singlemolecule direct visualization of wildtype uvrd was used and immobilized on the pegylated glass surface via streptavidinbiotin interactions one of the two oligonucleotides was labeled with biotin for glass surface immobilization and the other was labeled with cy the completion of dna unwinding was detected by the disappearance of cy fluorescence fig a then buffer u solution  mm nacl  mm mgcl  glycerol and  mm trishcl ph  containing cylabeled uvrdc and atp was infused into the flow cell as observed for wildtype uvrd the cy and cy fluorescence intensities decreased almost simultaneously after the cy fluorescence intensity increased in two steps suggesting that dna unwinding was completed immediately after the binding of the second uvrdc molecule to the dna fig b fig c shows a trace with a threestep cy fluorescence decrease indicated with arrows suggesting that three uvrdc molecules are involved in dna unwinding fig d shows the experimentally obtained distribution and theoretical distributions one two and threemolecule dna unwinding models of the number of step changes in the cy fluorescence intensity just before or after dna unwinding the theoretical distributions were calculated based on the labeling rate of cyuvrdc  and the dwell time for the second uvrdc association the distribution of the one and twostep fluorescence changes in the experimentally obtained traces was closest to that of the twomolecule model fitting the experimentally obtained distribution with a linear combination of the predicted models was used to estimate the percentages of the one two and threemolecule models which were   and  respectively therefore these results indicate that not a single uvrdc molecule but two or three uvrdc molecules were mostly involved in unwinding dnauvrdc associationdissociation events were then analyzed based on the kinetic scheme of the uvrddna interaction  fig a the stepwise cyfluorescence increases or decreases were interpreted as uvrdc association or dissociation events respectively fig b shows the dwelltime distribution of the indicated states involving up to two uvrdc molecules excluding the dwell time just before completion of the dnaunwinding process the mean associationdissociation rate constants were obtained by fitting the distributions using a single exponential a comparison of the obtained association and dissociation rate constants with those of wildtype uvrd showed that the association and dissociation rate constants of the first uvrd molecule k k were comparable whereas those of the second uvrd molecule k k were approximately  fold higher for uvrdc fig c this result indicated that the deletion of the cterminal amino acid affects the dna association and dissociation of the second bound uvrd molecule rather than the first bound uvrd molecule which would suggest that uvrdc molecules form a dimer less frequently than wildtype uvrdthe two or three uvrdc molecules that bound to dna just before completion of the dnaunwinding process presumably interacted with each other and formed an oligomer on the ssdna tail the selfinteraction and oligomer formation on dna was originally proposed from a nonlinear sigmoidal dependence of dna unwinding efficiency on wildtype uvrddna  which cannot be explained by the independent monomer model the independent monomer model has been proposed for some helicases such as dda  and recq  which states that these helicases can unwind dna without selfinteraction or oligomerization to test this selfinteraction hypothesis a singlemolecule dnaunwinding assay was performed using a dsdna substrate with a shorter  ssdna tail bp dna with a nt  ssdna tail  fig a the assay demonstrated that two or three uvrdc molecules were bound just before completion of the dnaunwinding process fig b and c even though the dna has a minimum ssdna overhang length  nt required to unwind bp dsdna this result together with the reported results that  wildtype uvrd molecules are difficult to bind to blunt dsdna  and  each wildtype uvrd molecule supposedly occupies ssdna length of    nt  suggested that multiple uvrdc molecules are present on dna during dna unwinding these results supported the selfinteraction or oligomerization of uvrdc molecules on dna which is further supported by singlemolecule fret imaging the observed conformational change in the b domain and dna unwinding activation fig l and m induced by binding of a second wildtype uvrd monomer indicated some physical contact between uvrd molecules on ssdnapossible reasons for the discrepancy between the conclusions obtained by the singlemolecule direct visualization study and the studies that proposed the monomer modelthe preceding sections described the authors results obtained by singlemolecule direct visualization study that not only wildtype uvrd but also uvrdc unwound dna presumably in an oligomeric form which contradicts the  conclusion obtained by biochemical and genetic studies that uvrdc unwinds dna in a monomeric form this section discusses possible reasons for this discrepancy table  lists the buffer conditions and dna substrates used in the singlemolecule direct visualization and studies using genetic and biochemical assays on uvrdca first plausible reason for this discrepancy may be the difference in the dna substrates used mechanic et al performed velocity sedimentation and sizeexclusion chromatography in the absence and presence of nt ssdna and concluded that uvrdc was monomeric regardless of the presence or absence of dna they did not detect the dimeric uvrdc probably because they did not use a dsdna substrate with an ssdnadsdna junction and  ssdna tail maluf et al  and our group  showed that wildtype uvrd has a high affinity for the ssdnadsdna junction therefore mechanic et al possibly failed to detect binding of multiple uvrdc molecules to ssdna a second reason for this discrepancy may be the difference in buffer compositions mechanic et al used buffers containing  mm nacl to examine and compare the biochemical characteristics of uvrdc with those of wildtype uvrd   the authors reported that uvrdc had comparable ssdnabinding ssdnastimulated atpase and dsdnaunwinding activities to wildtype uvrd however the conditions of these experiments were quite different  mm nacl  or  glycerol from those used for analyticalsedimentationequilibrium ultracentrifugation and sizeexclusion chromatography experiments  or  mm nacl  glycerol which concluded that uvrdc is active as a monomer maluf et al reported that uvrdc may form a dimer while unwinding dna and the above experiments by mechanic et al were performed in a solution with a low nacl concentration  mm in the absence of glycerol at a low ph  and at a high temperature c which were favorable for oligomer formation the author detected the association of multiple uvrdc molecules with dna in buffer u  mm nacl  glycerol a third possible explanation for the discrepancy may be the shorter temporal interaction of the second uvrdc for dna than wildtype uvrd as described previously the dissociation rate for the second uvrdc monomer was estimated to be approximately fold larger than that for wildtype uvrd indicating that the binding of the second uvrdc monomer on dna is transient this makes the detection of the binding of multiple uvrdc molecules more difficultin the previous section the use of high and low nacl solutions was discussed in addition buffer u used in the singlemolecule visualization study contained a low nacl concentration of  mm which was significantly lower than physiological conditions and unlike the buffer conditions used for biochemical analyses by mechanic et al  thus another singlemolecule visualization was performed under a physiologically relevant buffer condition with a higher nacl concentration  mm nacl fig a this buffer condition was analogous to that used in the velocityultracentrifugation experiments by mechanic et al  and was reported to be more unfavorable for dimer formation the visualization showed a twostep increase in cy fluorescence fig b as well as cy fluorescence increases with a two or more fold increase in intensity compared to those of the cyfluorescence intensity increases from one cyuvrdc fig c just before completion of the dnaunwinding process these results indicated that two uvrdc molecules can bind to the dna and that multiple uvrdc molecules are also involved in dna unwinding even under highsalt physiologicallyrelevant salt conditionsvisualization under physiologically relevant salt conditions also showed that the association rate for uvrdc under high salt conditions was much lower than that under  mm nacl it was reported that the uvrd concentration in vivo was  m  moleculescell  and that the effective concentration of a nick in the genomic dna in vivo which is created by other dna repair enzymes near a damaged or mismatch dna was  nm the uvrd and nick concentrations were much higher several thousand and several hundred times respectively than those used for the singlemolecule assays uvrdc and ssdnadsdna junction concentrations were  nm and  nm or  pm respectively on the other hand the ratio of uvrdc to the ssdnadsdna junction in the singlemolecule assays was  which is similar to that of the uvrdnick in vivo  thus uvrdc association events must occur much more frequently in vivo than in singlemolecule visualization finally the association of multiple uvrdc molecules with dna and their participation in dna unwinding observed under  mm nacl condition is relevant to uvrd function in vivo although the in vivo environment including high crowding conditions would somehow modulate the dimerization of uvrd on dnathis paper provided a brief explanation of the classification of helicase sfs based on structural homology and introduces two opposing nonhexameric helicase models concerning sf helicases this paper reviewed past and recent studies on uvrd including the authors singlemolecule direct visualization of wildtype uvrd and a uvrd mutant lacking the cterminal  amino acids uvrdc the latter of which was used in genetic and biochemical assays supporting a monomer model the visualization revealed that multiple uvrdc molecules jointly unwound dna which is more likely in an oligomeric form generally speaking rarely occurring and transient proteindna interactions are difficult to detect by conventional biochemical ensemble measurements because the interaction is frequently buried in static and averaged data in contrast as reviewed in this paper direct visualization of single protein molecules is of great utility and is capable of detecting such interactions without ensemble averaging in real time the reason why dimeric uvrd is necessary for efficient dna unwinding has not been fully elucidated if xray crystallographic structures of dimeric uvrd were available the structures could provide deep insights into this fundamental question however since they are not yet reported this is not unfeasible at present meanwhile a singlemolecule fret imaging study provided an important clue to the question indicating that intramolecular conformational change of monomeric uvrd induced by dimer formation increases the helicase activity the imaging study showed that interaction of a late coming uvrd monomer with a uvrd monomer prebound to dna shifts the b domain conformation of the prebound uvrd monomer causing activation of helicase activity and triggering completion of dna unwinding fig l and m the b domain movement of uvrd was also observed using singlemolecule forcefluorescence microscopy  as described in previously the catalytic role of b domain in dna unwinding has been originally proposed based on crystal structures of sf helicases including uvrd pcra and rep    intriguingly conformation fixation of the b domain of pcra and rep by intramolecular crosslinking dramatically increases its unwinding processivity  bp   based on crystal structures it has been proposed that the b subdomain of sf helicases including uvrd pcra and rep plays a catalytic role in dna unwinding    the proposed b domain movement of uvrd was observed using singlemolecule forcefluorescence microscopy  as described previously intriguingly closed conformation fixation of pcra and rep by intramolecular crosslinking dramatically increases its unwinding processivity  bp  a recently published paper reports the direct measurement of uvrd stepping dynamics unwinding and rezipping dna under various atp concentrations using highresolution optical tweezers  the stepping mechanism modeled based on the singlemolecule measurements and molecular dynamics md simulations is consistent with the notion that uvrd unwinds  bp per atp hydrolysis cycle the step size which is defined as the average number of bp unwound between successive ratelimiting steps was estimated for monomeric and dimeric uvrd the estimated average step sizes were nearly the same  bp indicating that dimerization does not significantly affect the unwinding step size thus detailed coupling between atp hydrolysis and dna unwinding that is to say how the energy derived from atp hydrolysis is utilized by each monomeric uvrd consisting of a uvrd dimer remains unknown and merits further studypast structural and biophysical studies have shown that protein oligomerization is a critical factor in the regulation of many proteins  such as enzymes ion channels receptors and transcription factors oligomerization plays an essential role in regulating protein activity and structural stability it has been reported that more than  of intracellular proteins exist in an oligomeric state including dimers  the brenda enzyme database httpswwwbrendaenzymesorg the most comprehensive enzyme repository lists only about onefourth of enzymes as monomersdirect singlemolecule observation of uvrd will further elucidate the interrelation among the cterminal amino acids and oligomer formation dna unwinding activity and atpase activity which can be applied to other helicases the interrelation should be investigated using more severe form of deletion mutants yokota recently performed singlemolecule direct visualization of uvrdc and obtained preliminary results that indicate that two uvrdc molecules are also involved in dna unwinding presumably in an oligomeric form therefore singlemolecule direct visualization of nucleic acidbinding proteins provides quantitative and kinetic information to reveal their fundamental mechanisms furthermore the visualization can help identify transient and minor populations usually overlooked by conventional ensemble averagingbased measurements and determine kinetic rate constants which will enlarge our understanding of

Response to reviewer comments,HIRKA_22.docx,Response to reviewer comments,HIRKA_22.docx,p the end of the second paragraph note however that beating the random walk model thanks to the business cycle frequencies is only marginally confirmed as the mse ratios for those cases are slightly below  p before the last paragraph in addition the band spectral regression does not necessarily provide more accurate forecast in comparison to the time domain regression for the taylor rule fundamentals page  before table  the reason why we consider r is that we attempt to highlight the sole importance of high and low frequencies since bac is not estimated unlike the unrestricted model we do not face the label switching     p end of  footnote note that the prediction error of highu is the same for that of lowu because the selection matrix a for high is the matrix ac for low and vice versa ba for high is identical to bac for low and vice versa as a result the predicted future exchange rates for high and low should be identical the same argument holds for high and low however this label switching may not occur in practice because we are using the discrete fourier transform matrix w where the number of columns specifies how narrowly the entire frequency between  and pi is split into in effect there is a case where one column of w say the jth column corresponds exactly to pi for high due to the size of the estimation window r being an even number in such a case the selection matrix a includes the jth column of w and ac excludes it when low is considered a includes the jth column of w whereas ac excludes it hence a in high is not identical to ac in low leading the predicted future exchange rates to differ however if there is no column of w that corresponds to pi then a in high is ac in low making the prediction errors of high and low identical p before the last paragraph footnote additionally it is worth mentioning that when highu mse ratio and that of lowu are considerably different despite possible label switching we can surmise that the border frequency pi carries relatively large information that contribute the accuracy of forecasting similarly pi is an important frequency when highu and lowu have different mse ratios in light of this the taylor fundamentals have important information for forecasting around such border frequencies as tables  and  showfurther we created the following subsection to interpret our results from the view point of economic forecasting we would like to consider this paper to be more of an economic paper hence explaining why the ppp model can predict future exchange rates better than other models including the random walk model for high forecasting horizons is an integral part of the paper in what follows we present the reasons that are obtained by the frequency domain approach employed in this paper     it is well known since meese and rogoff  that the ppp fundamentals have high predictive power of future exchange rate when the forecasting horizon becomes higher we also confirm it in table  let us consider the reason of high predictive power using our frequency domain results   from the argument presented in  long horizon forecasts look at the filtered process that is amplified its low frequency components figures  and  display stst and stst respectively now when the right hand side of the ppp model is considered the ppp fundamentals or real exchange rates shown in figure  may not be stationary series but somewhat mean reverting whereas the monetary fundamentals generally possess noticeable low frequency trend components as presented in figure  in  we discussed that the high horizon filter magnifies the middle to low frequency components making it easier to estimate the parameters for those frequency bands and leading to a more accurate forecast provided that the relationship between the exchange rate and the fundamentals exists and is stable in those frequency bands the problem for the monetary fundamentals is that the relationship does not seem to exist or stable in the low frequency in particular as it is clear by comparing figures  and  where downward trends are present only in the latter and a small of rejections in table  on the other hand the ppp fundamentals exhibit a stable middle to low frequencies relationship between the exchange rate and fundamentals is more precisely estimated with higher horizons in particular we find that the business cycle frequencies are important for forecasting accuracy as presented in table  this is because the business cycle frequency components of the ppp fundamentals are reasonably dominant and stable over time however as table  shows this tendency at the business cycle frequencies is weak at the monetary fundamentals therefore the ppp fundamentals are better than the monetary fundamentals at forecasting high horizons ie the ppp fundamentals beat the random walk model more often all in all the ppp fundamentals or the real exchange rate are stable over time in that the relative importance of middle to low frequencies especially the business cycle frequency is present for all estimation windows therefore the ppp fundamentals model has a high predictive power for high horizons both for the frequency domain regression including bma and lasso and the timedomain regression that uses all frequency bands   next let us consider the time domain equivalence of the band spectral regression using the business cycle frequencies from equations xx and xx the lag coefficients for the lag model can be computed as yb x where x is the ppp fundamentals and y is the exchange rate figure  displays the estimated lag weights for the swiss restricted ppp fundamentals model with h since we need estimated ba and bac to compute the lag weights and we have tr estimation windows for which we have different ba and bac our lag weights are computed as follows the solid line is the lag weights computed from the average estimated coefficients over all estimation windows whereas the dotted lines are lag weights computed from the estimated coefficients that are  and  percentiles of estimation windows compared to other frequency bands bands the regression using business cycle frequencies band places a relatively small weight at lag  and slowly decaying weights for long periods this implies that the use of the distributed lag model can potentially improve the accuracy of forecast when appropriate restrictions are imposed  while it is difficult to find the timedomain equivalence for lasso since it is not practical to utilize equation xx we can understand from the discussion above that accurate forecast requires i high horizons iii business cycle frequencies and iv stable relationship within frequencies between the exchange rate and the fundamental across estimation windows especially we need the fundamentals that do not exhibit trends or breaks therefore the ppp fundamentals have high predictive power with lassoin addition the following sentences have been included in the introduction to accentuate our finding  these findings lead us to the explanation as to why the ppp fundamentals perform better in high horizons in both the frequency domain regression and conventional time domain regression unlike other fundamentals such as the monetary fundamentals the ppp fundamentals  the real exchange rate  has the stable dynamic relationship with the exchange rate especially in the middle to low frequencies especially business cycle frequency also we added the following sentence to the conclusion in order to clarify one of our contribution   page middle we demonstrate that the band spectral regression and its extension lasso elucidate the reasons why the ppp fundamentals perform better in high horizons through the lens of the frequency domain analysis while the frequency domain approach improves the accuracy of exchange rate forecast it gives us insight into the reason of the ppp fundamentals is a powerful predictor when the forecasting horizon is high and possible improvement of the time domain regression forecast , to clarify our results we added the following footnotes           why are the ppp fundamentals good at forecasting long horizons        the following sentence has been added to the abstract  abstract

recent years the purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of the attention branch network abn for implant classification using convolutional neural networks cnns the data consisted of  dental implant images from  implant brands that cropped the site including dental implants as pretreatment from digital panoramic radiographs of patients who underwent surgery at kagawa prefectural central hospital between  and  resnet   and  were evaluated as cnn models that were compared with and without the abn we used accuracy precision recall specificity f score and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve as performance metrics we also performed statistical and effect size evaluations of the time performance metrics of the simple cnns and the abn model resnet with abn significantly improved the dental implant classification performance for all the performance metrics effect sizes are equivalent to huge for all performance metrics in contrast the classification performance of resnet and  deteriorated by adding the attention mechanism resnet showed very high compatibility with the abn model in dental implant classification auc despite the small number of parameters as a limitation resnet was verified as a cnn in this study but further studies are required for other cnn modelsdental implants are a longterm predictable treatment option for defect prostheses  in particular the osseointegration type root form implants currently have high predictability and are commonly used  with the increase in reliability and success rate of dental implant treatment the number of patients treated with dental implant prostheses is increasingon the other hand there have been reports of complications as the number of dental implants increases  complications related to dental implants are classified into biological and mechanical complications  therefore it is important to understand the characteristics of each type of implant such as the shape of implant fixture surface texture type of abutment joint and fixing screw it is necessary to remove the implant when it becomes difficult to continue using it owing to complications although various devices are available as removal tools  understanding the type of implant is necessary for easy removal unfortunately it has also been reported that implant removal is required if continuous maintenance is not possible due to difficulty in identifying the implant brand type  therefore it is important to accurately identify the types of dental implantsin recent years studies using a classifier in deep learning to identify the type of implant have been reported  many of these studies employ convolutional neural networks cnns which are more accurate owing to a number of parameters that keep deep layers however increasing the number of parameters in the deep layers leads to the burden of calculation cost by adding another structure to the cnn structure  or changing the structure of the cnns  various developments have been made such as achieving the same accuracy with a small number of parametersthe attention mechanism which is a means of determining which part of the forced data is emphasized has attracted attention in various fields of deep learning in recent years the attention mechanism had been incorporated into a recurrentneuralnetworkbased model used in natural language processing called seqseq and has received a lot of attention  after that it was used in advanced models such as transformer  proposed for machine translation and bert  based on it and achieved high accuracy in various natural language processing tasks recently the image attention mechanism has also been used in image recognition techniques attention branch network abn  is attracting attention because it can recognize with high accuracy which area of the feature map output by cnns should be focused on by the attention mechanism therefore we predicted that higher accuracy could be achieved by adding abn to the implant brand identification classification using deep learning the purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of abn for implant classification accuracy using cnnsthe purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of adding abn to a deep learning model using cnns on implant classification performance this is a study based on deep learning using cnns and supervised learning was adoptedthis study was approved by the institutional review board of kagawa prefectural central hospital approval number  the institutional review board which reviewed our study waived the need for personal informed consent because it featured a noninterventional retrospective design and all data was anonymized and analyzed there were two types of panoramic

network model proposed by microsoft research in   in image recognition it has been known that increasing the number of layers of a cnn generally results in the acquisition of higherdimensional features however there was a problem that performance deteriorated due to loss of gradient when simply adding many layers the residual network solved the gradient loss problem by introducing a shortcut connection and enabled the construction of cnns with deep layers the representative resnet models resnet  and  were used in this study table  shows the number of parameters for each simple resnet modelto construct an efficient model finetuning was used to retrain some of the weights of the existing trained modelstherefore all resnet models have adopted finetuning using the imagenet database the deep learning classification task process was implemented using keras version  tensorflow version  and the python language version the abn used in this study consists of three modules including feature extractor attention branch and perception branch table  shows the number of parameters for each simple resnet with abn model in the abn model feature extraction was performed using the part of resnet excluding the fully connected layer after that the extracted features were connected to the abn and attension mechanism as feature maps  perception branch a module that outputs class probability values by using features and attention maps for convolution layersin this study cam with k   classes consists of k     convolutional layer global average pooling gap and a full concatenation layer k     convolutional layer outputs a feature map showing the gaze area in a particular class this feature map is down sampled to k     by gap the attention map in each class was visualized by weighting it with the joint weights of the fully connected layer instead of a fully connected layer for continuous learning a convolutional layer was introduced in cam in this study a    convolutional layer was introduced instead of an allcombining layer because the network holding a fully connected layer of vggnet was used as a baselinethe top layer is built on a cam base consisting of convolutional layers and gaps to generate attention maps however since cam uses the weights of all the learned convolutional layers to generate the attention map it is not possible to generate the attention map during the training process to solve this problem we constructed a k     convolutional layer instead of a fully connected layerthis convolutional layer mimics the final fully connected layer of cam in the forward propagation process after the convolutional layer the attention branch generated the probability values of the classes by using the gap return values together with the softmax function then to aggregate the k feature maps these feature maps were convolved by  convolutional layers to generate feature maps we used the feature maps standardized by the sigmoid function as the attention maps for the attention mechanism figure  shows a schematic overview of the abn modelthe perception branch outputs the final probability value of each implant brand using the feature map by attention and feature extractor the attention map was applied to the feature map by the attention mechanism we introduced a calculation formula that emphasizes the feature map of the region where the attention map strongly responded and prevent the feature map from disappearing even in the zero region of the attention mapabn was learned endtoend using the loss of attention branch and perception branch the training loss function l xi of abn was obtained by a simple addition of the training loss of the two branches as shown in the following equationthe training loss of each branch is calculated using the softmax function and the crossentropy the abn feature extractor is optimized by receiving the gradients of the attention branch and the perception branchmodel training was generalized using kfold crossvalidation k   as a method of using all data other than test data in the training algorithm  the test data consisted of  images within each fold the dataset was split into independent training sets and validation sets with a split ratio of  each fold validation set is a fold that is completely independent of the other training folds and was used to assess training status during the training period after completing one model training step we performed similar validations four times using the test dataall deep learning classification models were trained and evaluated on a bit ubuntu  lts operating system canonical ltd london uk and an nvidia geforce tesla vsxm  gb graphics processing unit nvidia sta clara ca usa all input image data were resized to    pixels the optimizer weight decay and momentum were constant for all models the optimizer used stochastic gradient descent and the weight decay with momentum was  the learning rate was   all the models were trained over a maximum of  epochs and a minibatch size of  this process was repeated  times for both the simple cnn models and the abn model using different random seedsall the deeplearning models were evaluated with the help of different metrics such as accuracy precision recall specificity and f score these numerical performance metrics are calculated as in equations   in addition we employed area under the curve auc and receiver operating characteristics roc metrics in this study performance metrics were adopted as an evaluation of cnn model performancein these equations tp fn tn fp represent true positive false positive true negative and false negative respectivelyit is important to visualize the rationale for image prediction by cnn gradientweighted class activation mapping gradcam targets cnnbased image recognition models it is a method to give a judgment basis to the model by weighting the gradient with respect to the predicted value we used a heat map to emphasize the part that served as the basis for judgment according to the importance gradcam used the final convolution layer of the resnet model and the attention map visualization was reconstructed using the final layer of the attention brancha statistical evaluation of the classification performance between the simple cnn models and the abn model was performed on the data all data were analyzed  times repeatedly with a commercially available software the jmp statistical software package version  for macintosh sas institute inc cary nc usa and pvalues   were considered statistically significant in all analyses nonparametric tests were performed based on the results of the shapirowilk test the difference in classification performance between the simple cnn models and the abn model was calculated for each performance metric by the wilcoxon test for multiple test comparisons in each model dunnetts test was performed effect sizes were calculated as hedges g unbiased

respectively and n and n are the numbers for the simple cnn models and the abn model respectively the effect size determination was based on the following criteria proposed by cohen and expanded by sawilowsky  huge effect was  very large effect was  large effect was  medium effect was  small effect was  and very small effect was the results of comparing the simple cnn models with the abn model are presented in table  in resnet  the abn model showed much higher classification performance compared to the simple cnn model interestingly all performance metrics showed a statistically significant increase in abn and the effect size was huge on the other hand both resnet  and  simple cnn models had statistically significantly higher classification performance compared to the abn model with resnet the effect size was equivalent to large in all performance metrics whereas with resnet  the effect size was large for all performance metrics except auc and the effect size for auc was hugefollowing the comparison of the simple cnn and abn models we performed multiple comparisons of the performance metrics of the cnn models resnet   with different layers in the simple cnn and abn models and the results are shown in table  for simple cnn models dunnetts test was performed based on resnet  resnet achieved statistically significantly higher performance than resnet in all performance metrics similarly resnet  performed statistically significantly better than resnet  the results of the abn model differed from those of the simple cnn models in dunnetts test based on resnet  with abn very interestingly resnet  with abn showed statistically significantly higher performance than resnet  and  with abntable  multiple comparisons of models with different numbers of layers for simple cnns and cnns with abn statistical results analyzed by dunnetts testfigure  shows the image that visualizes the region of interest of the deep learning model the simple cnn models visualized the feature areas for implant classification from the final layer of the convolutional layer using gradcam the abn model visualized the feature regions extracted from the feature extractor using grad cam furthermore the feature area obtained from the attention mechanism was visualized as an attention heat map in feature extraction using the simple cnn models and gradcam there was no clear difference between the models on the other hand there was a very interesting discovery in the abn model in resnet the features extracted from the feature extractor were not enough however the attention mechanism completely complemented the features in contrast the feature extractor enabled sufficient feature extraction with resnet and  however with resnet and  it was confirmed that feature extraction became insufficient by going through the attention mechanismfigure  visualization of the cnns region of interest using simple cnns and abns with gradcam and attention heatmapsthis study compared dental implant classification performance using simple cnn models and an abn model resnet with abn was found to show the highest classification performance despite the small number of parametersthere have been many studies on the classification of dental implants using cnns   and these studies have achieved high classification accuracy however it is difficult to simply compare classification performance with previous studies because it was analyzed under different conditions such as the number of training and test images the type of implant and the model in the past three to twelve different types of implant classifications have been considered in this study  types of implant classification tasks were performed which are more than those of the previous studies in general the accuracy decreases as the number of classifications increases in our previous study   classification tasks were    accuracy for resnet  and  respectively in this study of  classifications resnet  and  were   and  respectively and the classification performance deteriorated however performing many types of classification is a condition that more reflects clinical medicine and the significance of our study will be greatin the past degradation occurred and consequently the accuracy became saturated and the performance was lower than that of a shallow network when the layer was deepened in deep learning to address that issue resnet was developed with a shortcut added to the network  owing to this structure the deep learning model could be more accurate as the layer was deeper even in the results of this study resnet achieved the best classification performance in a simple resnetonly structure in addition statistical evaluation from the results of  repetitions showed significantly higher performance in contrast the results were very interesting in the abn model resnet with abn showed the highest performance surprisingly the statistical evaluation was also significantly better than resnet  and  with abn the abn model for dental implant classification revealed that it was not related to the depth and accuracy of the models layersin comparison between the simple cnn models and the abn model the abn model had statistically higher performance metrics in resnet and all effect sizes were huge in contrast in resnet and  the abn model had statistically lower performance metrics and all effect sizes were from large to huge in the abn model the accuracy of the model was dramatically improved by adding an attention mechanism to resnet in contrast with resnet  and  the addition of an attention mechanism reduced accuracy one answer to this result was the visualization of the judgment area of the cnn with resnet  and  feature extraction with the feature extractor was sufficient to extract implants the attention heatmap for resnet  showed some deficiencies in the extraction of complete features in resnet the part opposite to the feature extraction in the feature extractor was judged as a feature in the attention heat map this was thought to be due to the antagonism between the attention mechanism and the feature extraction in resnet some feature extractions were insufficient however in the attention heat map the entire area was judged as the feature area it has been reported that not only the implant fixtures but also the surroundings are the focus of judgment as the basis for judgment of implants by deep learning  therefore with resnet it is thought that higher classification accuracy could be achieved by focusing on the entire area few studies have reported using abn for medical imaging ding et al analyzed cnn models using abn for skin lesion classification  and reported that the use of abn significantly improved the classification accuracy of melanoma and seborrheic keratosis however there are no reports on other medical images yet and this study which examined the use of abn in implant classification is very novelin this study effect size was also calculated as an evaluation method for model comparisons in deep learning effect size represents the effect of experimental manipulation and the strength of association between variables and is an index showing the degree of standardized effect that does not depend on the unit of data  effect size reporting in contrast to its statistical significance facilitates the interpretation of the importance of study results  in this study resnet  with abn showed significantly better performance at pvalues statistically furthermore when examining effect sizes the resnet model with abn showed effect sizes that could be classified as very large effects this suggests that a significant contribution of the model with abn in implant identification we are confident that our study is the first to show effect size in implant classification using deep learning with abn and will play an important role in future studiesour research will provide an important perspective for implant diagnosis in future dental treatments in the classification of dental implants it is required to make a more accurate diagnosis with a model that is as light as possible in this study the resnetbased abn model with the smallest number of parameters achieved the best accuracy this result is very important the fact that the addition of the attention mechanism did not significantly increase the number of parameters indicates that data processing does not require a high degree of computer processing power in addition the acquisition of performance metric variability from  independent tests proved a more accurate and generalized model in future our proposed implant classification model may become an effective model for clinical use in this study abn was used for accurate classification of implant brands other implantrelated information is also important for clinicians for dentists and dental staff from the panoramic radiographs image it is desirable to be able to locate the implant classify the brand classify the diameter of the implant and condition the bone around the implant without cutting out therefore in the future it will be necessary to implement a deep learning model for object detection using region based convolutional neural networks rcnn etc and to conduct accuracy verification research this study has two limitations the first is the type of cnn models we considered there are so many wellknown cnn models today that we need to validate a cnn model that is more compatible with the abn however it requires a very large amount of calculation cost to obtain the effect size and it is hoped that you will refer to our examination this time the second is the state of the used image data the image used in this study is removed from the implant as a pretreatment with abn we achieved a very high accuracy when considering using this image however in the future it is desirable to be able to identify the site where the implant is implanted from the panoramic radiograph and further classify the type of implant further research is required from this point of view as wellin this study we proposed an optimal deep learning model for comparing the classification performance of dental implants using a simple cnn model and an abn model in the dental implant classification we found that resnet  showed very high compatibility in the abn model and showed the best classification performance despite the small number of parameters these results may play an important role in the rapid and accurate classification of dental implants

second week than lro group pserich polyphenols possessed as promising galactopoietic through orchestrating prl and oxt and reduce the mortality of pups hypogalactia or low breast milk production is still challenging for new mothers to complete their exclusive breastfeeding  exclusive breastfeeding for  months as a recommendation from world health organization who is necessary for an infants growth and development mothers milk was important for infants life because it provides essential nutrition which is strongly associated with lowering the risk of neonatal mortality due to neonatal infections such as sepsis pneumonia tetanus and diarrhea secretion of breast milk or lactogenesis is tightly regulated by autocrine control which prolactin prl and oxytocin oxt play an essential role in successful lactation  milk is synthesized by lactocytes undergo prolactin regulation on mammary gland growth and epithelial proliferation  milk is stored in the alveolar lumen and requires oxt for ejection  stimulation on the nipple by the infants suckling leads to oxt release by the hypothalamus furthermore oxt induces contraction of myoepithelial cells surrounding the ducts and alveoli forcing milk out through the nipple  the multiple factors including insulindependent diabetes retained placenta insufficient glandular tissue smoking and obesity which mostly followed by the mood change postpartum depression maternal stressed about his milk production and early introduction to formula milk might alter the neuroendocrine function through impaired in prolactin and oxytocin levels resulting in decreased of mothers milk production  therefore prominent anxiety symptoms are being the crucial issue that raised at the postpartum stage and many mothers are seeking for medication to treat their negative thought and obsessive  some antipsychotic drugs including domperidone are commonly used to increase milk production domperidone act as a dopamine antagonist which blocks dopamine d receptors dr in the anterior pituitary which inhibits lactotroph cells activity to secrete prolactin  regarding the safety and sides effects which are possibly rise for both mother both and infant  there are many researchers interested to discover herbal galactagogues which considering can stimulate milk production and less side effect for the body  herbal galactagogues that are commonly used by the society include fenugreek  milk thistle silybum marianum dandelion seaweed  sauropus androgynous  and moringa oleifera  herbal galactagogues contain active compounds such as flavonoids terpenoids tannins and essential oils to increase breast milk production based on the interview with some breastfeeding mothers in malang city indonesia another herbal galactagogue that is widely used by indonesian society is shield aralia polyscias scutellaria leaves with the local name mangkokan p scutellaria are less popular than s androgynous as galactagogues in silico research over p scutellaria active compounds suggested that those active compounds have inhibitory activity into dr and hydroxytryptaminea receptors htar which are involved in prolactin secretion  further we aimed to elucidate the role of p scutellaria active compounds to increase breast milk productionp scutellaria fresh parts were collected from the local garden at malang city east java indonesia during

were presented as mean  standard deviation data were analyzed using oneway analysis of variance anova and followed by duncan multiple range test dmrt as a post hoc test p   was considered significantly difference the tpc was expressed as mgg of the samples in gallic acid equivalent gae and was estimated by the folinciocalteu method as displayed in table  the tpc of pse was highest in the absolute ethanol than  ethanol and distilled water also there was no significant difference in tpc p between the three solvents used the tfc was determined in comparison with quercetin standard and expressed as mgg of the samples in quercetin equivalent qe the tfc result obtained in our study displayed that absolute ethanol solvent has the highest tfc compared to ethanol  and distilled water additionally there were no significant differences in tfc p between the three solvents used table  the antioxidant properties of extracts with different solvents were then evaluated using a dpph assay dpph assay was widely used as a method for evaluating antioxidant activity in a relatively short period the ic values for pse were in the order aqueous  absolute ethanol   ethanol table  our current study demonstrated that there was no significant difference p in the dpph scavenging activity between the three solvents used  qualitative determination of aqueous leave extract of p scutellaria bioactive compounds using lchrmsto our knowledge the current study is the first to report and identify the bioactive compounds in aqueous pse the bioactive compounds we found were selected based on their best matching at   which is considered reasonable confidence while   is considered to have excellent spectral matching to the mzcloud spectral library  there were six compounds that have the best match up to  including rutin quercetindglucoside quercetin kaempferol oleanolic acid and caryophyllene oxide and the rest of pse compounds found to have the best match around  till  table  lchrms analysis revealed us to identify  flavonoid compounds including  flavonols  flavonoido glycosides and  flavonoidoglycosides table  also aqueous pse contains  terpenes  phenolic acids and  lignan table  overall lchrms reflects that aqueous pse predominantly contained flavonoids such as quercetin rutin kaempferol quercitrin quercetindglucosides afzelin hyperoside quercetin orhamnosideoglucoside and kaempferologlucopyranosylorhamnopyroside interestingly the previous report demonstrated that quercitrin quercetin rutin and afzelin might interfere with the lactation pathway  thus we selected and displayed quercitrin quercetin rutin and afzelin chromatogram as seen in figure the current study used aqueous pse for in vivo study we chose the aqueous pse to investigate its effect due to aqueous leaves extract was commonly used in society based on simple regression analysis the pse at dose  mgkg bw was found to increase the body weight gain the highest for four weeks followed by lro figure a the simple regression analysis was in accordance with the pups weight change result figure c surprisingly the lactating rats given common drugs have the lowest body weight gain among other groups  on the other hand the body weight gain of lactating rats was fluctuating for four weeks except for rats treated with psa  mgkg bw figure b interestingly pse at dose  mgkg bw is consistent to decrease the bodyweight of lactating rats followed by pse at dose  mgkg bw figure d the virgin rats showed to gaining body weight for four weeks figure bduring the treatment we found that not all pups cannot survive until postweaning table   the lro showed the highest pups mortality than other groups interestingly there was no mortality observed on lactating rats which was given by pse at dose  mgkg bw table  our result demonstrated that there was a significant difference p between prl levels on the virgin rats and lactating rats figure a the prl levels were fluctuating for three weeks although either pse or drugs control used was observed to increase prl production interestingly pse  mgkg bw administration showed to boost prl significantly p and the highest among other groups in the first weeks in the following weeks there was no significant difference in prl levels among treatment groups interestingly at the third weeks the untreated lactating rats showed a decrease of prolactin levels close to the virgin rats group figure awe also examined the oxt levels during lactation for three weeks we found that the oxt levels were declined every week except in the untreated lactating rats group figure b surprisingly there was no significant difference p in the oxt levels between virgin and lactating rats on the first week except in pse  group further pse  mgkg bw enhance the oxt levels of lactating rats for two weeks before the fall in the third week figure b plant biochemistry is frequently wellstudied due to its abundant bioactive compounds including their secondary metabolite groups the metabolomic investigation based on lcms has gained much interest in recent years to discover the bioactive compounds which exhibit antioxidant and others health impacts  therefore some natural galactagogues plants were traditionally consumed by a local community p scutellaria is less popular than sauropus androgynous as galactagogues but p scutellaria leaves were believed and consumed as natural galactagogues however there is still a lack of information about p scutellaria phytoconstituent regarding its role as one of the herbal galactagogues our result for antioxidant activity demonstrated that pse has a higher ability to scavenge dpph radicals the common mechanism is due to electron donation or provides hydrogen atoms to convert dpph radicals into a colorless product besides the greater the extract could be resulting in a colorless product or smaller ic values the more potent the extracts ability to donate electrons or provide hydrogen atoms  the previous report suggested that flavonol possess significant antioxidant properties among others class of flavonoid due to its cc double bond conjugated in oh  further the previous study was recognized that flavonol quercetin possessed greater antioxidants than catechin and naringenin as flavanol and flavanone respectively  interestingly some studies reported that phytochemicals such as flavonoids and carotenoids could be found on human milk although their presence was dependent on several factors  hence our result suggested that pse increases the survival rates of pups table  in the point of view of pups we assumed that phytochemicals contained in pse contribute to maintaining redox balance which is beneficial to protect pups health from oxidative stress inflammation and some related disorders  according to the weight gain of pups data we found that pse administration has a higher average weight gain for three weeks although we did not have milk yield data from its dam we hypothesis that pse administration could stimulate higher secretion of milk from dams to support the infants nutrition need which further influences the pups body growth a previous study reported that the lactation yield of dams was in line with an average of weight gain pups quercetin administration restores the milk deficiency and improves the pups body weight  another study reported that the launaea taraxacifolia extract and resveratrol supplementation may stimulate milk yields of the dam which lead to an increase in the pups body weight  in addition the pse administration may improve the milk quality which may indirectly interfere with the increase of the pups body weight milk is essential for the growth and maintenance of pups since it represents the primary source of nutrition for pups the previous study reported that acacia nilotica spp adansonii supplementation elevated the nutritional values of dams milk   based on the weight of dams showed that in all group of lactating rats the dam loss their weight during lactation during the gestational period the buildup mechanism of visceral and femoral fat stores is essential as a source of energy for milk production in the lactation stagebreastfeeding those adipose tissue will be used to produce milk for their infant maternal total energy expenditure increases during lactation up to  these mechanism contributed on dammother weight loss furthermore the serum prl at the first week was elevated in lactating rats treated with pse  mgkg bw before a decrease in the second week and slightly increased at the third week figure  prl is a polypeptide hormone which structurally similar to growth hormone and synthesized by lactotrophic cells in the anterior pituitary  prl is recognized as a major lactogenic factor that is essential for milk production prl binds to its receptor prolactin receptor prlr and activates jakstat signaling which is necessary to develop lobuloalveolar and regulates gene transcription of milk protein in the mammary gland also prl activates pikakt signaling to support jakstat signaling which is required to regulate mrna translation of milk protein glucose transport and the lipid and lactose biosynthesis  our previous study predicted that pse bioactive compounds such as afzelin rutin kaempferol quercitrin and quercetin were involved in the jakstat signaling pathway thus the bioactive compounds of pse were influenced by the prlr and htar to stimulate lactogenesis  in silico study between bioactive compounds found pse with htar resulted that the bioactive compounds bound to htar which is involved in breast milk production as dopamine antagonist    the previous study reported that quercetin stimulates prlr expression in mammary cells via akt activation which leads to excess lipid synthesis during lactation  besides other galactagogue combinations also could regulate glucose transport resulting in the upregulated of lactose synthesis  similar to our result we suggested that pse administration elevated prl levels in the lactating rats which may contribute to improving milk supply on the other hand oxt also has a pivotal role during breastfeeding as an important trigger for prl oxt is a peptide hormone that is produced by the hypothalamus and transported into the bloodstream by the posterior pituitary gland and it is released in response to the suckling reflex  oxt concentration during early breastfeeding was correlated with milk yield supply duration of lactation and reduced stress  interestingly higher oxt was found to protect weight loss in the newborn  the previous study reported that both prl and oxt were acting synergistically through maintain each other concentration balanced during lactation for successful lactation  the higher concentration of oxt was seen in pse administration until  weeks before fall at the third week pse showed the galactopoietic effect through promising effect enhancing both prl and oxt concentration pse might stimulate milk ejection in the mammary gland and improved stress among  of australian women was prefer to consume one or more galactagogues include herbal galactagogues and domperidone as a common prescription during breastfeeding to increase breast milk production  interestingly dietary flavonoids on the postnatal periods were reported to reduced anxiety physical health improvement and higher perceived quality in mothers  the presence of polyphenol on the pse might have a beneficial impact during lactating through their antioxidative effect and orchestrated the prl and oxt hormones which are importantly required to maintain milk supply and support pups healthin summary p scutellaria leaves extract is a rich source of polyphenols including flavonoids terpenoids phenolic acids and lignan p scutellaria leaves extract possessed antioxidant activity and the total phenolic and flavonoid contents were not significantly different among the three solvents used in this study p scutellaria leaves extract showed the promising effect as novel herbal galactagogues through maintain prolactin and oxytocin concentration during lactation and increase the survival rates of pups further studies are still needed to establish the efficacy of p scutellaria leaves extract and its molecular mechanism for medicinal purposesthese experimental procedures have been approved by ethical

Research paper_Journal article,JAORN_29.docx,Research paper_Journal article,JAORN_29.docx,background localized provoked vulvodynia lpv is the main cause of pain during sexual intercourse in women the exact etiology of lpvis yet to be determined several observations point to potential involvement of the the vaginal microbiota here we examined differences in the vaginal microbiota composition of women with lpv and the effect of lowoxalate diet on microbiome composition methods nine women diagnosed with secondary lpv and  randomly recruited healthy controls at galilee medical center israel were prospectively evaluated total dna was extracted from vaginal discharge of women provided both before and after completing a threeweek lowoxalate diet following s sequencing we calculated alpha and beta diversity identified differentially abundant bacterial taxa and performed metabolic pathway analysis results vaginal microbiota was significantly more similar between women of the lpv group compared to the control group compositional analysis revealed the genus ochrobactrum and family pseudomonadaceae as the most descriptive for lpv also  differentially abundant metabolic pathways were identified between lpv and controls low oxalate diet was associated with betadiversity changes in vaginal microbiome of lpv patients and reflected in a trend of pain reduction without statistical significanceconclusion lpv and low oxalate diet were associated with shifts in the vaginal microbiota composition the impact of these changes on the development of lpv needs additional studies with a larger sample sizethe international society for the study of vulvar disease issvd defined vulvodynia as vulvar pain of at least three months duration without clear identifiable cause which may have potential associated factors the most common type of vulvodynia is localized provoked vulvodynia lpv which affects women in all reproductive stages and ethnicities it can affect at some point up to  of premenopausal women  lpv is described as a  burning sharp or stabbing pain in the vulvar vestibular area in response to different activities like attempt of sexual penetration or tampon insertion women with primary lpv report significant pain from the first attempted vaginal entry either with tampons or coitus while women with secondary lpv were initially free of entry pain the exact etiology of lpv is unknown but abnormalities in embryonic development inflammation previous genital infections geneticimmune factors and neuroproliferation are suspected to play a role in the pathogenesis of lpvthere is a wealth of research on the human microbiome focusing on community composition in various regions of the body and a number of health implications have been identified the human microbiome project  found that the genus lactobacillus was dominant in vaginal microbiota it maintains the acidic environment in the vagina and prevents growth of yeast harmful bacteria and viruses vaginal microbiota dysbiosis is associated with several vaginal infections such as bacterial vaginosis bv vulvovaginal candidiasis vvc and sexually transmitted infections stis eg trichomoniasis furthermore vaginal microbiota dysbiosis has been found to be involved  with lpv in ddition  two  observations may suggest involvement of the vaginal microbial milieu in its etiology the association of lpv with preceding chronic recurrent candidiasis and with group b streptococcusa case report published in  suggested that  a low oxalate diet and the use of calcium citrate led to complete remission of symptoms in a woman with lpv and increased urinary oxalates this publication prompted a thought that excessive excretion of oxalate in the urine was a possible etiology for the development of vulvar pain however the reports in the literature were controversial and a later study  showed no difference in the amount of excreted oxalate between the women with and without lpv yet as we set to study the association between the vaginal microbiome and lpv we recalled that diet raising the hypothesis that perhaps in the few cases it was beneficial it was through the influence on the microbiome constitution the purpose of the present study was to examine whether there is a difference in vaginal microbiota between healthy women and those with lpv and whether a low oxalate diet leads to vaginal microbiota changespatients diagnosed with lpv were recruited at the galilee medical center nahariya israel nine women with lpv and  healthy controls were recruited in the first phase of the study we compared the vaginal microbiome of women with severe lpv to that of women without lpv healthy controls without any dietetic intervention in the second phase we characterized the effect of a threeweek lowoxalate diet on the vaginal microbiota of the same women with lpv compared to a group of patients with lpv not treated by diet the study was approved by the institutional review board helsinki committee of the galilee medical center authorization  nhr given on april   and registered with the clinical trials registry clinicaltrialsgov nct all participants signed informed consent forms before enrollmentpatients considered eligible for the study received a validated questionnaire for the diagnosis of lpv  all study participants had to fulfill the first two of the three friedrichs criteria  the presence of pain with pressure to the vestibule or when attempting to insert an object into the vagina and pain with pressure to the vestibule upon examination symptom duration of more than six months was required for enrolment in the study the type of lpv was secondary the severity of the symptoms to be included in the study group had to be graded as level  or  according to marinoff level  pain during sexual intercourse that sometimes leads to avoidance of sexual intercourse level  pain during sexual intercourse leading to complete avoidance apareuniaclinical evaluation of the pain level was assessed by a gynecologist experienced with lpv diagnosis using a numeric pain scale nrs of  in response to the qtip test performed by applying pressure with a qtip to  sites in the vaginal entry region surrounding the hymenal ring no pain maximum pain exclusion criteria were generalized vulvodynia constant vulvar pain  unrelated to

group included  healthy women without lpv as determined by their history physical examination and by the qtip testin a low oxalate diet products such as tomatoes berries coffee nuts and more are excluded five women of the study group were asked to have a low oxalate diet menu for three weeks the menu was written by a clinical dietician and patients adherence to the diet was verifiedvaginal swabs were collected from two sites posterior region of the vulvar vestibule and the medial posterior region of the vagina the swabs were obtained within three days of the time of ovulation the ph of the  vaginal region was measured by microelectrodes extraction of total dna from swabs was performed using the powersoil dna extraction kit mobio carlsbad ca according to the manufacturers instructions purified dna was pcr amplified using primestar max takaraclontech shiga japan for the variable v region using fr barcoded primers of the s rrna gene amplicons were purified using agencourt ampure xp magnetic beads beckman coulter brea ca and subsequently quantified using quantit picogreen dsdna quantitation kit invitrogen carlsbad ca equimolar amounts of dna from individual samples were pooled and sequenced using the illumina miseq platform at the genomic center of the barilan university at the azrieli faculty of medicine israelin addition vaginal swabs were cultured for the presence of candida spp and group b streptococcus gbssequencing data were processed using qiime version  singleend sequences were grouped into operational taxonomic units otus using the greengenes database and sequences with a similarity of  or greater were grouped into the same otu chimeric sequences were removed and rarefaction was carried out using  sequences per sample sample depth alpha and beta diversity were calculated based on rarefied datasets several alpha diversity indices were calculated including shannon and faith phylogenetic diversity statistical significance was confirmed

link between the microbiomes and  the immune system in the development of lpv are being increasingly discussed in the present study the main finding was a significant difference of beta diversity between lpv patients and controls additionally the current study is the first one reporting the family pseudomonadaceae and especially the genus ochrobactrum as the most associated with lpv other bacterial taxa described in the literature as common in women with lpv were examined for example aalto et al  have shown differences in  bacterial species collected from the vulvar vestibule  however in the present study none of these differentially abundant taxa were found another study showed no major differences in bacterial species in the vagina and vestibule between women with and without lpv except for an increased prevalence of streptococcus spp and lactobacillus iners in some women with lpv compositional analysis identified  differentially abundant metabolic pathways this could be connected to the increase in abundance of pseudomonas spp pseudomonadaceae which are known to utilize nitrate for respiration we also found a significantly lower abundance of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides biosynthesis pathways in lpv patients compared to controls see table  thus our study supports the finding that the family pseudomonadaceae and the genus ochrobactrum may be associated with vaginal dysbiosis and the appearance of lpv symptomswe found no statistically significant difference in the presence of vaginal candida between lpv and control groups  in some studies a history of vulvovaginal candidiasis outbreaks was common prior to the onset of lpv symptoms  in addition we found that there was no significant difference in the presence of gbs  between the two groups this is in discordance with some studies that have shown an increase in the prevalence of certain strains of streptococci in women with lpvin addition to the microbiome composition we examined the ph in women with vulvodynia before and after the low oxalate diet to evaluate if the low oxalate diet had any impact and whether it could explain a decrease in pain level as a result of the diet however there was no statistically significant difference in vaginal ph before and after the use of a low oxalate diet our finding is in line with the report in the literature that showed no difference in the amount of excreted oxalate in women with and without lpv still we depicted that the low oxalate diet effected the microbial beta diversity and there was a statistically significant shift of microbial beta diversity between dieting and not dieting lpv women yet these changes had a minimal influence in the dyspareunia level only a nonsignificant trend of reduction in the qtip test scores was noticed between the beginning of the study and after  weeks of low oxalate diet p the small sample size might have influenced the statistical significancedespite the small sample our study provides some evidence that low oxalate diet could be associated with pain reduction and changes in microbial diversity the current study compared the microbiome of lpv patients with controls and identified differentially abundant metabolic pathways because our study is based on small sample size all results must be interpreted with caution and further research with larger sample size are

school of medicine nagoya  japantears are an exocrine physiological fluid secreted onto the ocular surface from the lacrimal apparatus in all mammals tearing is categorized into three types based on their roles basal reflex and emotional limited research has been conducted on the functional neuronal circuitry of tear production in particular the neuronal mechanisms of emotional tearing which is a physiological reaction harmonized with enhanced emotional arousal and assumed to be unique to humans remain unclear here we show the neurocircuitry tearing by the functional neural connectivity with cellsubtype specificity we identified that the oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus is functionally projected to the oxytocin receptorexpressing neurons in the lacrimation center of the superior salivatory nucleus optogenetic activation or inhibition of these neurons andor receptors can modulate the superior salivatory nucleus dependent tear secretion mediated through oxytocin moreover we identified that maternal behavior nociceptive behavior stimulation and aversive memory retrieval are linked to tearing in mice suggesting that mouse have the potential for evoked emotionallinked tearing these emotional linked tearing are suppressed by optogenetic inhibition of the corresponding oxytocin system thus tearing could be regulated through functional connections between central oxytocin systems in the paraventricular hypothalamus and the superior salivatory nucleus tears constitute an exocrine physiological fluid that is secreted onto the ocular surface from the lacrimal apparatus in all mammals via three mechanisms   basal secretion comprising a continuous lowlevel flow that constantly covers the cornea and helps to maintain a healthy transparent ocular surface by ensuring homeostatic balance maintained through basal physiological activity of the lacrimal apparatus  reflex tearing comprising transient excessive watering from the eye that protects the eye against sudden environmental changes such as physical and chemical insults to the ocular surface and  emotional tearing wherein the evidence for emotional linked tearing in nonhuman animals is lacking is triggered by extreme emotional arousal invariably linked to heightened behavioral vocalizations kneeling down jumping around andor hugging and physiological effects changes in blood pressure heart rate respiration andor perspiration emotional tearing is a salient and expressive visual cue that shapes the perception of human facial expressions and facilitates social bonding among humans lacrimation is regulated by parasympathetic preganglionic neurons located dorsolateral to the facial nucleus in the dorsolateral portion of the reticular formation termed the superior salivatory nucleus sus this area sends efferent fibers to the lacrimal gland lg via the pterygopalatine ganglion  and receives afferents from the trigeminal sensory neurons from the ocular surface and various brain regions including the frontal cortex basal ganglia thalamus and paraventricular hypothalamus pvh  tearing is considered to be regulated by the coordination of these neural systems and lg activity however this assumption is based on anatomical findings largely defined by gross or macroscopic necropsy  immunostaining  or nongenetic tracing approaches  rather than investigations of the functional neural connectivity with cellsubtype specificity in particular for emotional tearing despite the universality of this phenomenon in humans the neurological investigation for emotional tearing based on experimental observations has been poorly conducted thus far the overall purpose of this study was to investigate the functional neuronal circuitry of tearing thus we strived to explore whether mice evoke emotional linked tearing and highlight the neural system that regulates this type of tearingto shed light on the functional connectivity of the central neural systems that regulate tearing we initially assessed whether manipulation of sus parasympathetic neuron activity influences tear secretion creinducible adenoassociated virus aavflex expressing lightsensitive

oxytocin oxt is a peptide synthesized by neurons predominantly located in the pvh that send descending projections to the sus  and supraoptic nucleus son and accessory nuclei ah  oxt acts as both a hormone and a neuromodulator the hormonal release of oxt is essential for parturition and lactation whereas intracerebral release of oxt as a neuromodulator has been implicated in the regulation of social   and emotional processes  oxt systemrelated social and emotional responses that are commonly associated with emotional tearing in humans include fear   pain  distress   delight  and empathy   furthermore oxt has been linked to wholebody homeostatic processes  including food and fluid intake regulation  thermoregulation  and cardiovascular regulation  we therefore functionally interrogated the activity of pvh oxt oxtpvh neuronsaavflexchreyfp acramcherry or mcherry control was unilaterally injected into the pvh of oxytocinirescre mice oxtcre mice fiber optics were implanted above the pvh fig e since the pvh is bilaterally symmetric and lies nearly opposite across the third ventricle histochemical analysis was performed to validate the chreyfp acrmcherry or mcherry expression of contraipsilateral pvh the cell number fig f upper bar chart and colocalized ratio fig f middle bar chart of ipsilateral oxtpvh merged with chreyfp acrmcherry or mcherry were significantly higher approximately five fold than that of the contralateral pvh no significant differences were noted among chreyfp acrmcherry and mcherry the chreyfp acrmcherry or mcherry were nearly exclusively colocalized with oxtpvh fig f lower bar chart paraventricular hypothalamus cfos expression ratio in mcherry or chrexpressing oxtpvh neurons after optical stimulation are shown in extended data figure  optical stimulation of aavflexchreyfp injected into the ipsilateral pvh results in the significantly largecfosexpressionin the oxtpvh neurons merged with chreyfp in the ipsilateral pvh compared to the contralateral pvh upon optical stimulation of aavflexmcherry ipsilateral injected into the pvh no difference was noted in the ipsilateral pvh and contralateral pvh the expression level in the contralateral pvh upon optical stimulation of aavflexchreyfp was similar to that of mcherry injection extended data fig  thereby suggesting that this histochemical validation can be applied to investigate the functional projection from each pvh associated with bilateral eye tear secretionactivation and inhibition of oxtpvh neurons bilaterally increased and decreased tear secretion respectively these changes were instantaneous stimulation withinthe initiation of our measurements  min powerdependent and persistent with optical stimulation similar to that of chatsus tear secretion was not altered during optic stimulation in the control group fig  g and h and extended movies s a to c we further examined the effects of optogenetic activation of the son or ah on tear secretion aavflexchreyfp was unilaterally injected into the son or ah of oxtcre mice and fiber optics were implanted ipsilaterally to the viral injection site tear secretion was not altered during optical stimulation of the son or ah extended data fig  these findings resulted in the hypothesis that the interaction between chatsus and oxtpvh neurons could play a significant role in tearingthereafter we examined the functional connectivity between oxtpvh and chatsus neurons to evaluate whether manipulating the activity of susprojecting oxtpvh oxtpvhsus neurons altered tear secretion oxtpvhsus neurons were modulated by unilateral injections of aavflexchreyfp or aavflexacrmcherry into the pvh and fiber  optics were bilaterally implanted over the sus in oxtcre mice fig a we observed bilateral representation of the axons expressing chreyfp or acrmcherry in the sus region fig c optical activation and inhibition of the sus increased and decreased ipsilateral tear secretion from the eye corresponding to the stimulated site respectively histochemical analysis of sus noted that optical stimulation of aavflexchreyfp injected ipsilateral pvh results in significantly largecfosexpressionin the chatsus neurons in the bilateral sus compared to that of optical stimulation of acramcherry extended data fig a dual viral vector approach was used for chemogenetic activation of the pvh neurons projecting to chatsus neurons  aavdfrthmdqmcherry was unilaterally injected into the sus and aavflexmchrerryaflippase flptetanus toxin cfragment ttc was injected into the ipsilateral or contralateral pvh corresponding to the virus injected into the sus of chatcre mice fig d in this system flp is transsynaptically transported to neurons projecting to the chatsus neurons hmdqexpressing aav was injected into the pvh and expressed dreadds in a flpdependent manner in the chatsusprojecting pvh neurons chatsus injection sites were confirmed by mcherry expression in sus  we observed the ipsilateral or contralateral expression of hmdq fused mcherry in the pvh corresponding to the virus injected into the sus  intraperitoneal injection of clozapine noxide cno resulted in the unilateral stimulation of tear secretion in the eye corresponding to the sus viral injection site fig f for tearing oxtpvh neuron functionally projects to the bilateral sus and the effects of each projection from the pvh to sus on the tear secretory levels is at the same level as the ipsi or contralateral side of the eye significant inhibition of the tear response is by the sole ipsilateral inhibition of the oxtpvhsus neuron while still receiving functional stimulation from the contralateral oxtpvhsus fig g and fig f implying that the effect of the complicated synaptic transmission such as the presence of axoaxonic synapses endings  may be quite influential on the functional afferent connection at the susperipheral oxt is secreted into the general circulation by oxtpvh projections to the posterior pituitary gland a wellestablished peripheral role of oxt is milk ejection from the mammary glands during lactation and uterine contraction during parturition via the induction of myoepithelial cell contractions mediated by activation of the peripheral oxt receptor oxtr  oxtrs are also expressed in the myoepithelial cells of the lg and participate in the excretion of tear fluid induced by contraction of the lg  to exclude the possibility that the changes in tear secretion induced by manipulation of oxtpvh neurons were mediated by peripheral oxt a series of optogenetic manipulations in oxtcre mice were performed while interrupting neuronal signaling from the central nervous system to the lg via surgical denervation of the lacrimal nerve innervating the lg  the lobular structure of lg acinar cells was maintained and an increase in the tear secretion following the application of oxt or acetylcholine to the lg was confirmed day postsurgery suggesting that the lg gland ability is preserved extended data fig a this protocol abolished the increase in tear secretion induced by activation of the oxtpvh neurons extended data fig b inhibition of lg oxtrs by exposure of the lg to the oxtr antagonist atosiban did not affect the increase in tear secretion induced by oxtpvh neuron activation in addition we observed a significant increase in the cfos expression in the chatsus neurons which was accompanied by oxtpvh neuron activation extended data fig  collectively these results demonstrate that functional neuronal connectivity from oxtpvh to chatsus neurons rather than peripheral lg oxtrs regulates the flow of tear secretiongiven that functional oxt release from the axonal terminals of oxtpvh neurons contributes to oxtrmediated actions  we examined the expression of oxtr in the lacrimal central sus an oxtrvenus knockin mouse line in which the venus fluorescent protein is expressed under the control of the oxtr gene promoter was used to characterize oxtrexpressing neurons in the sus region  we identified a venuspositive bilateral neuronal population in the sus region approximately  of these neurons coexpressed chat in oxtr venus  mice  venuspositive bilateral neuronal populations were not observed in oxtr venus  mice oxtrs activate gq proteins that couple to downstream signal transduction pathways thus triggering intracellular calcium responses as secondary messengers to induce various biological reactions  to confirm whether oxtr geneencoded proteins in chatsus cells exhibited functional properties of endogenous oxtrs we monitored the activity of chatsus neurons in response to oxt to record the activity of chatsus neurons the frster resonance energy transfer fretbased ratiometric geneencoded ca indicator yellow cameleonnano ycnano  was specifically expressed in chatsus neurons by injecting aavflexycnano into the sus of chatcre mice we performed twophoton ca imaging of sus neurons in acute brain slices of the reticular formation including the sus region  stimulation with oxt induced a concentrationdependent increase in the fret ratio in the sus and this increase was completely suppressed by application of the selective oxtr antagonist l  and extended  in addition application of the selective oxtr agonist way  increased the fret ratio in the sus and this increase was completely suppressed by l  and extended  depolarization with high k induced a transient overshoot in the fret ratio fig d and extended movie  a and bto further investigate whether manipulation of oxtrexpressing neurons in the chatsusoxtrsus modified tear secretion aavflexchrmkate acramcherry or mcherry control were unilaterally injected into the sus of oxtrcregfp mice oxtrcre mice fiber optics were implanted over the

optical stimulation of aavflexchrmkate injected sus results in significantly largecfosexpressionin the oxtrsus neurons colabeled with chreyfp compared to that of optical stimulation of acramcherry extended data fig activation and inhibition of the oxtrsus neurons ipsilaterally increased and decreased tear secretion respectively these changes were stimulation powerdependent and persistent in response to the optical stimulation tear secretion was not altered during optical stimulation in the control group  and extended  next to investigate the involvement of oxt in the increase in tear secretion evoked by the activation of oxtpvhsus neurons we injected aavflexchreyfp unilaterally into the pvh of oxtcre mice and implanted an optical fiber and a cannula into the sus for the pharmacological blockade of synaptic transmission between oxtpvhsus and downstream neurons fig e pretreatment of the sus with the oxtr antagonist nonpeptide l dosedependently decreased basal tear secretion extended data fig a and suppressed the increase in tear secretion induced by optical stimulation of the oxtpvhsus neurons fig fand g based on previous reports that oxt is coreleased with glutamate from the axon terminals of the oxtpvh neurons within the central nucleus of the amygdala  a series of treatments was performed prior to treating the sus with glutamate channel blockers application of glutamate channel blockers aminohydroxymethylisoxazolepropionic acid ampa receptor antagonist ap or nmethyldaspartate receptor antagonist nbqx alone suppressed the increase in tear secretion induced by the optical stimulation of the oxtpvhsus neurons  left bar collection cotreatment with l and ap or nbqx did not compensate for the inhibitory effect of l  right bar collection further we confirmed that exposure of the sus to oxt or oxtr agonists increased tear secretion treatment of the sus with oxt or the nonpeptide oxtr agonist way  via an implanted cannula in wt mice dosedependently increased tear secretion  b to d suggesting that increased tear secretion modulated by optical stimulation of oxtpvhsus neurons was modulated via oxt release within the sus accompanied by the corelease of another factor that required glutamate channel receptor activation dto further investigate the functional linkage between the susprojecting oxtpvh oxtpvhsus neurons and oxtrsus neurons in tear secretion we examined whether an increase in the tear secretion by activation of oxtpvh is suppressed by synchronized inhibition of the oxtrsus neurons extended data fig  we ipsiunilaterally injected aavflexchrmkate into the pvh and aavflexhmdimcherry into the sus of oxtcreoxtrcre mice  and fiber optics were implanted over the pvh extended data fig a following intraperitoneal injection of cno ipsilateral sustained decrease in the basal tear secretion was observed extended data fig c gray line while basal tear secretion remained unchanged bilateral increase

stimulation of the pvh under decrease in the basal tear secretion ipsilateral suppression of increased tear secretion during optical stimulation of pvh was observed extended data fig c red line histochemical analysis confirmed the bilateral expression of chr fused mkate and ipsilateral expression of hmdi fused mcherry in the oxtrsus extended data fig b to further ensure that the mcherrypositive neurons in the sus of oxtcreoxtrcre mice originated from the oxtrsus and not the oxtpvh neurons we injected aavflexchrmkate into the pvh of oxtrcre mice  or injected the aavflexhmdimcherry into the sus of the oxtcre mice during optical stimulation of pvh of the oxtrcre mice did not alter the tear secretion and no visible expression of chr fused mkate was observed in the oxtpvh extended data fig d intraperitoneal injection of cno into the oxtcre mice did not alter the tear secretion and no visible expression of hmdi fused mcherry was observed in the chatsus extended data fig e collectively these data highlighted that neuronal signaling from oxtpvh neurons to oxtrsus neurons mediated via oxt released from oxtpvh neurons at least partly mediates tear secretion originating from the central nerve systemtearing is categorized into three types based on their roles basal reflex and emotional  we examined whether oxtpvhsus andor oxtrsus participates in tearing according to these categories optogenetic activation and inhibition of oxtpvhsus andor oxtrsus neurons increased and decreased basal tear secretion respectively fig g fig a and fig d these oxtrelated neurons may be involved in the maintenance of sustained basal tearing for providing a wettable and healthy transparent ocular surface areflex tearing constitutes transient tearing evoked by sensory stimuli to the ocular surface such as cold sensation foreign bodies or irritant chemicals  reflexive tears are secreted regardless of the mental or emotional status sensory stimuli received by sensory receptors on the ocular surface are afferently transmitted to the sus via the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve and retransmitted to the efferent pathways which reach the lg and stimulate tear secretion  to examine the involvement of oxtpvhsus and oxtrsus neurons in reflex tearing we measured the changes in the secretory capacity of reflex tearing under the optogenetic inhibition of oxtpvhsus or oxtrsus neurons to inhibit oxtpvhsus neurons we bilaterally injected aavflexacrmcherry into the pvh and implanted fiber optics over the uilateral sus of oxtcre mice fig a to inhibit oxtrsus neurons we injected aavflexacrmcherry into the unilateral sus and implanted fiber optics over the ipsilateral sus of oxtrcre mice fig ctransient reflex tearing was evoked by sensory eye stimulation with topical eye instillation of an agonist of nociceptor transient receptor potential vanilloid  capsaicin  following bilateral inhibition of oxtpvh neurons projection to unilateral sus fig a the capsaicinstimulated transient increase in tear secretion did not change with or without the inhibition of oxtpvhsus neurons fig b however unilateral inhibition of oxtrsus neurons fig c suppressed capsaicinstimulated tear secretion from the eye ipsilateral to inhibited oxtrsus neurons fig d instillation of vehicle eye drops did not alter tear secretion with or without the inhibition of oxtpvhsus extended data fig aor oxtr sus neurons extended data fig b suggesting that oxtrsus neurons and not oxtpvhsus neurons participate in reflex tearing bemotional tearing with bilateral synchronization is associated with increased tear secretion accompanied by high emotional arousal rodent models are used extensively to elucidate the neural mechanisms of the sleepwake cycle memory system social cognition and sensory transduction however there is a paucity of research on emotional tearing in rodents as this phenomenon is assumed to be unique to humans despite lack of conclusive evidence the term emotion can be referred to as an adaptative behavioral response that allows an organism to increase its chance for survival and can be traced back to at least darwin   this phenomenon related to survival functions includes defense maintenance of energy and nutritional supplies fluid balance thermoregulation and reproduction likewise it is proposed that animal emotions are evolved from basic mechanisms that were derived from positive seeking lust care play and negative fear rageanger and sadnesspanic responses  the neural systems that modulate these survival functions regard emotion to be conserved to a significant degree across mammalian species including humans  thus in order to assess potential emotionallike tearing in mice we measured the increase in bilateral tear secretion under various behavioral stimulatory conditions based on the emotions with positive bonding and reward or negative nociception and distress valence among the behavioral stimulation conditions suckling dams a behavior associated with maternal bonding and persistent nociception induced by paw formalin injections  and facial formalin injections   elicited marked increases in bilateral tear secretion fig a while the response to persistent nociception or maternal stimuli that increased tearing has significant importance for survival function the common features among behavioral stimuli in the presence or absence of tearing fig a are unclear considering that the expression of the survivalrelated behaviors is speciesspecific  the observed variance among tearing in response to behavioral stimuli may possibly result from the differences in the relative importance for their own survival in mice to further investigate whether the increase in tearing in response to behavioral stimulation conditions could be regarded as emotionlinked tearing we focused on suckling dams and paw formalin injections the latter being a wellestablished protocol for nociceptive behavior   maternal behavior comprises a highly conserved motivated behavioral repertoire in mammals that is indispensable for the survival and development of pups  to characterize tearing elicited in suckling dams during maternal bonding we evaluated the changes in tear secretion in suckling dams during mother pup separation and reunion pups were encased in a wire mesh ball and were reunited with dams following  hours of separation in independent housing to avoid social interaction in suckling dams tear secretion decreased to normal values during pup separation after reunion tear secretion temporarily returned to the same levels as those during the suckling period at  min and subsequently decreased to the same levels as those during the separation period fig b red line upper panel in suckling dams that were not reunited with pups tear secretion did not change during an encounter with an empty wire mesh ball fig b blue line upper panel pup retrieval behavior frequency of nose contact with pups fig  c and e upper panel and distance moved fig  d and e upper panel were significantly increased during the first  min after reunion with pups and remained at the same levels thereafter compared to the levels in the dams that were not reunited with pups further we examined cfos expression in the pvh and sus cfos expression in the pvh fig f and sus fig g was higher in dams that were reunited with pups than in the dams that were not reunited with pups in virgin females tear secretion was not changed by encounters with pups or nonpup stimuli and basal values were sustained throughout the evaluation period fig b lower panel the frequency of nose contact with pups was significantly higher in the first  minutes after encountering pups compared to that without pups although the values were significantly lower than those for suckling dams fig  c and e lower panel distance moved did not change after encountering pups or nonpup stimuli during the monitoring period fig  d and e lower panelalthough the precise emotions and feelings associated with crying may vary human crying is generally elicited by emotional arousal from a combination of external stimuli eg social situations and physical stimulation andor internal stimuli eg thoughts memories and experiences  to investigate whether mouse tearing could be linked to internalexternal emotional cues we evaluated the relationship between tearing and contextual conditioning of aversive memories using paw formalin injections paw formalin injections were performed in the context condition and changes in the tear secretion alongside nociception responses were measured retrieval and extinction of aversive memories were examined in the same context condition without formalin treatment and changes in tear secretion were measured at intervals of  to  days fig a an increase in tear secretion was associated with the dose of formalin injections and nociceptive responses fig  b to d after paw formalin injections day  suppression of nociceptive responses by pretreatment with the nonsteroidal analgesic acetylsalicylic acid aa diminished the increase in tear secretion fig  b to d in addition paw formalin injections increased tear secretion and these effects were attenuated after surgical denervation of the lacrimal nerve innervating the lg fig s  this demonstrated that the increase in tearing was not due to peripheral stimulation of the lg by inflammatory factors caused by systemic inflammatory responsesduring reexposure to the context condition on the day after formalin injection day  the changes in the tear secretion patterns were similar based on the dose of the formalin injections and suppression with aa to those of day  fig  g and h nociceptive responses were not observed during reexposure in the absence of paw formalin injections fig i on days  and  tear secretion did not increase upon reexposure fig l immobilization time of the  formalin conditioned group was significantly longer on days  and  compared to that of the saline conditioned group fig m we also examined cfos expression in the sus and pvh on days  and  following treatment with formalin cfos expression in the sus fig e and pvh fig f was higher than that following saline injectionsto further confirm whether the increase in tear secretion was associated with the context condition changes in tear secretion during retrieval and reexposure were compared among three groups i home cage chamber with bedding hc a twochambered preference apparatus in which the context condition box was connected with ii the same context chamber cccc and iii the home cage chamber with bedding cchc separated by a removable guillotine door to confine the animal extended data fig a the separation door was opened  min after reexposure to allow the mouse to passively cross the apparatus tear secretion did not change in the hc group in the cccc group the changes in the tear secretory patterns were similar to those during reexposure to the context condition and no apparent effect of opening the separation door was noted in the cchc group the increase in tear secretion induced by the context condition decreased at the time of opening of the separation door and returned to its initial value within  min extended data fig c preference among two chambers after opening of the separation door was equivalent in the cccc and biased toward the hc camber in the cchc extended data fig b contextual fear conditioning by electrical foot shock nociceptive behavior stimulation that did not evoke tearing fig a did not alter the tear secretion this may imply that distinctive features andor intensity of emotional stimuli are necessary for evoking a tearing response extended data fig  finally we evaluated the involvement of oxtpvhsus neurons in elicited tearing during mother pup separation and reunion fig b nociceptive behavior stimulation fig c and aversive memory retrieval fig d following paw formalin injections changes in tear secretion were measured under the inhibition of oxtpvhsus neurons in oxtcre mice mice were unilaterally injected with aavflexacrmcherry or aavflexmcherry control into the pvh and fiber optics were implanted over the ipsilateral sus fig a under the mother pup separation and reunion optical stimulation was performed during minutes before to  minutes after reunion increase in bilateral tear secretion by pup reunion was evoked in mcherry withwithout and acr without optical stimulation fig b unilateral inhibition of oxtpvhsus neurons by acr with optical stimulationsuppressed tearing from the ipsilateral eye fig b pup retrieval behavior frequency of nose contact with pups extended data fig a and distance moved extended data fig b were as same level at mcherry and acr withwithout optical stimulation in the nociceptive behavior stimulation and following aversive memory retrieval optical stimulation was performed during  minutes after paw formalin injection or reexposure to the context condition increased in bilateral tearing was evoked by paw formalin injection fig c right and reexposure to the context condition fig d right was as same level at acr and mcherry during the optical stimulation increase in tearing from ipsilateral eye was significantly suppressed with inhibition of  oxtpvhsus in acr compare to mcherry fig  c and d overall our results suggest that emotionally linked tearing during maternal behavior nociceptive behavior stimulation and aversive memory retrieval is triggered via activation of oxtpvh neurons that project to the lacrimation central sus in response to emotional arousal c it is unclear whether the functional involvement of oxtpvhsus in tearing as well as expression in oxtrsus is relevant to humans considering that the function of the central oxt system lineage during evolution is also largely conserved across mammals  the central oxt system reported in this study may have a common role in the regulation of tearing in humans including emotionally evoked the behavioral response to external physical persistent nociception or internal maternal and memory retrieval emotional cues which elicited tearing in mice in this study is a fundamental reaction for survival across mammalian species in addition we have identified in a dog a mammalian species reportedly having notable humanlike socialcognitive skills tearing evoked when reunited with the dogs owner suggesting that nonhuman mammalian species at least mouse and canine have the potential for evoked emotionallinked tearing  therefore our study reveals that emotionlinked tearing is not a physiological reaction specific to humans homo sapiens that was acquired during evolution but constitutes an evolutionarily conserved behavior originating from lower mammals and passed on to humansdespite substantial debate regarding the significance of emotional tears in humans from psychological and philosophical perspectives the physiological role and interpretation of tearing in response to emotional arousal has been poorly investigated in charles darwins book expression of the emotions in man and animals   emotional tearing is proposed to be an incidental result of reflex tearing and this phenomenon is purposeless paradoxically a recent study reported that tears contain chemosignals in both humans and mice  that trigger social responses although we did not demonstrate direct evidence of the biological significance of emotional linked tearing our findings which demonstrate the involvement of the oxtpvhsus and oxtrsus in chat sus neuron in tear secretory neural pathway in emotionlinked tearing facilitate a neurosciencebased approach that promotes elucidation of the meaning of emotional tears thereby providing critical insight

Response to reviewer comments,JSHZY_83_4.docx,Response to reviewer comments,JSHZY_83_4.docx,thank you very much for taking the time to review this manuscript and for considering its revised version interference between bisethylhexyl phthalate and heavy metals cd and cu in mollisol during aging and mobilization we are grateful to the referees and the editor for pointing out some essential modifications needed in this paper we have substantially revised our manuscript after reading the comments provided with detailed corrections listed pointbypoint below the revised portions are marked in red in the manuscript we have used an englishlanguage editing service to polish our wording and its certification is attached the polished portions are marked in blue font in the manuscript the main corrections in the paper and responses to reviewer comments are as followsresponse thanks for your kind suggestion we revised the goal of our study as follows  which can be seen in lines x thank you for the suggestion you kindly offered us we have revised this sentence and replaced the relevant reference as follows  see lines x for details l yes this work is very similar description experimental design and some results with your published studythis study serves as a followup to an already published study and they may share similarities in research objectives and some mechanistic explanations but there are significant differences between them as a whole first potential interactions between heavy metal ions and dehp molecules have been identified however in that we do not know how their interactions affect their solubility and bioaccessibility this needs to be further explored dehpsomfinally these views have been updated in the introduction which can be seen in line xwe sincerely thank the reviewer for careful reading the original sentence could be confusing and we have replaced this sentence with a new one as follows l maybe but responses of the bioavailable forms of heavy metals in the presence of other organic matters have fully been reported therefore the novelty of this study is average l again the novelty of this study is average the authors can analyze how benzene methylbenzene polychlorinated biphenyl polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and other organic contaminants and cd hg as pb cu zn ni cr sn sb u th ba and other metals influence each others fate under complex pollution conditions in black red yellow brown and other soilsthank you very much for your comments in recent years we have been devoted to investigate the distribution behavior ecotoxicity of paes in soil and their remediation options as the problem of cocontamination has received more attention it is of some relevance to explore the fate of other pollutants when they cooccur with paes heavy metal contamination has been a thorny environmental issue and both its occurrence and that of paes contamination in agricultural soils may pose a threat to human health through the food chain it has been reported many times that phthalates and heavy metals were detected together in soils but the combined effects of paes and heavy metals have rarely been studied in particular the discovery of their interactions made us realize that their coexistence is likely to have complex environmental and ecological impacts which led us to conduct studies related to the combined pollution of paes and heavy metals l how can you complete this work without disturbing the soil you answered that you did not consider the effect of sampling on the soil because sampling does not appear to change the concentration of contaminants in the soilwould you kindly check that ploughing can change the content chemical forms and physical forms of organic contaminants in various kinds of agricultural soilsthank you very much for your thoughtful reminder first of all we apologize for our previous wrong reply after communication and confirmation with the experimenters each sample being sampled in this experiment was independent and the sampling method was destructive sampling we have added this important detail to the manuscript which can be seen in line x l i cannot find this key information which determines the rationality of your rainfall simulation in the referencethank you very much for your comment we have revised this sentence and corrected the relevant references as follows          l please check the application condition of single firstorder sfo kinetics in my experience it cannot simulate the degradation of soil organic pollutants accurately would you provide your n valuei appreciate the suggestion you came up with the suitability of this equation to be used in the study of dehp degradation in soil has been confirmed by many reports we have added in the manuscript these equations are widely used in studies of paes degradation xu et al  yuan et al  as can be seen in lines x moreover we also tried to fit the experimental data with other kinetic equations for example if the incubation time is long enough the degradation dynamics of paes in soil may show a biphasic pattern cheng et al  ie an initial rapid decline followed by a slow decline in which case a biexponential model may be more appropriate for fitting the degradation data the results showed that the biexponential equation was close to our singleexponential equation and the biexponential equation had a lower goodness of fit r as shown in the figure below in addition we would like to clarify that we have reviewed many references related to degradation and i am very sorry that i did not understand what n stands for so we did not provide it to you in the this letter cheng j liu y wan q yuan l yu x  degradation of dibutyl phthalate in two contrasting agricultural soils and its longterm effects on soil microbial community sci total environ   httpdoiorgjscitotenvthank you very much for your valuable advice since the aging effect in heavy metal soils involves many sorption mechanisms this may lead to some mechanistic explanations that are slightly similar in previous studies we did not observe significant effects of dehp on the sorption capacity of heavy metals however it is not known whether dehp affects the chemical species distribution of heavy metals which can directly affect the bioaccessibility of heavy metals the effect of paes on the chemical species distribution of heavy metals is a novel study that has not been reported in previous studiesthank you for pointing this out we have rewritten this part and added relevant references as follow              as can be seen on page xthank you very much for your comment since we mainly observed the concentration of pollutants in the leachate we did not test the concentration of heavy metals in the soil after each rainfall but we tested the concentration of heavy metals in the soil after the last rainfall event in order to calculate heavy metal recovery after the first rainfall event more cdcu was retained in the spiked soil this is because of the lower quality of the heavy metals exported from the spiked soil during the first rainfall event therefore we infer that the residual amount of cd in the spiked soil is higher after the first rainfall we have replaced sentence x with sentence xthanks for your valuable suggestion indeed this statement is arbitrary we have deleted this sentence in general the quality of this revised version is still average and some queries have not been resolved in addition the novelty of this study is low and the authors might have a lot of related papers by changing the combination of organic pollutants and metals in different kinds of soilthank you very much for your positive comments and constructive suggestions which have been very helpful in improving the quality of this manuscript issues that were not previously addressed have now been corrected in the new manuscript and we hope to gain approval from the reviewers moreover we would like to state unequivocally that we have not contemplated using switching pollutant combinations to publish a large number of articles nowadays combined pollution and pollution dispersion are common and the combination of soil pollution with heavy metals and organic pollutants has caused largescale global environmental problems it has been reported many times that phthalates and heavy metals were detected together in soils but the combined effects of paes and heavy metals have rarely been studied in particular the discovery of their interactions made us realize that their coexistence is likely to have complex environmental and ecological impacts which led us to conduct studies related to the combined pollution of paes and heavy metals along with shedding light on the behavior of cooccurring paes and heavy metals this study generated research ideas for examining the behavior of other cooccurring pollutantsthank you very much for your comment we have rewritten this part according to the reviewers suggestion and i hope the new abstract will allow the reader to know what the study has done even when reading it in isolation as detailed in lines x  introduction is poorly structured and full of sentences some of them new which are not logically linked to each other see for example lines thanks for your valuable suggestion we have revised the structure and part of the description of the introduction to make it more clearly structured and the language more fluent as can be seen on page x  authors still refer to black soils instead of using the adequate term from an international soil classification systemthank you very much for your comment we used the term mollisol  fao instead of black soil as can be seen in line x we made sure that the term black earth would not appear again in the new manuscript  i am able to see only one f or p value in the text there should be more the text is still full of increase and decrease without providing statistical support add table with all f and p valuesthank you for the suggestion you kindly offered us we have added p and f values in the new manuscript as shown in tables  the pvalues obtained from the post hoc comparisons have been marked in the fig  fig  and table   language is still not adequate many times i cannot understand what the authors mean see for example on the quality of the remaining or unbonded pollutants in the soilthanks for your kind suggestion we refined language further and invited native english speakers to review the new manuscript special thanks to you for your comments in order to flesh out the discussion section we have added some new sentences and paragraphs that contain mechanistic interpretations and practical implications as can be seen on line x, dear editor and reviewers responses to reviewer comments reviewer    l the findings of this study cannot support this goal  l i cannot find this information in the reference  l aging of metals in soils we appreciate your comments in the new manuscript this opinion has been removed by us the experimental design in references are shown below   references  l the description of this section is similar with your previous study  l this discussion is confusion any more data can support it l did you analyze the concentrations of these metals after each rainfall event  l any data can support it  reviewer      abstract when read in isolation does not provide a good idea of what was done   hypothesis is very weak thank you very much for your suggestion we have refined the hypothesis as can be seen on page    authors still use the term speciation when they should use fractionation we appreciate the suggestion you came up with we have replaced all the speciation see line x   discussion is still tedious

ishikawa  and kazunori nagasaka abstract the incidence and mortality rates of cervical cancer are rising among young women in japan in november  the japanese ministry of health labour and welfare reinstated the active recommendation for the human papillomavirus hpv vaccine which was discontinued in june  due to reports of adverse reactions including chronic pain and motor dysfunction following vaccination however vaccine hesitancy among the younger generation remains and it is essential to identify the barriers in vaccination uptake therefore we aim to conduct a randomized study using different methods of providing educational contents to improve health literacy regarding cervical cancer and hpv vaccination among female students in japan here we present the results of our and discuss current topics related to hpv vaccination in japan data were collected from  female studentsdivided into three groups no intervention printbased intervention and snsbased interventionusing the health literacy scale and communicative and critical health literacy scale our primary results indicate that participants knowledge and health literacy improved post intervention therefore medical professionals must provide accurate scientific knowledge regarding routine hpv vaccination and the risk of cervical cancer to young women to improve their health literacy and subsequently increase the hpv vaccination rates  the incidence and mortality rates of cervical cancer among young women are increasing in japan  human papillomavirus hpv is a known cause of cervical cancer and is responsible for vaginal vulvar and head and neck cancers  the hpv and hpv subtypes are most commonly associated with cervical cancer highrisk hpv is detected in almost  of cervical cancers of which approximately  and  are caused by hpv subtypes  and  respectively followed by hpv subtypes    and  the relative risk of cervical cancer is exceptionally high for women with hpv types  and  who are  times more likely to have cervical cancer than hpvnegative women  it is estimated that complete coverage with hpv vaccines in the female population could reduce cervical cancer incidence by up to  worldwide  the hpv vaccine was developed to block the route of hpv infection and is an excellent vaccine characterized by the following  the induction of hightiter hpv antibodies in more than  of vaccinated persons aged  years with titers several to ten times higher than natural antibodies the absence of nonresponders and the development of hpv antibodies in the absence of nonresponders  and  in several countries largescale clinical trials in yearolds have shown that infection with the vaccine subtypes subtype  or  and the resulting development of moderate cervical dysplasia or other conditions including cervical cancer is almost  prevented if the  however due to reports of adverse reactions such as chronic pain and motor dysfunction after vaccination the government stopped actively recommending it on june    consequently while the hpv vaccination rate for girls born between  and  who were eligible for vaccination during the period when the public subsidy was introduced was around  for girls born after  it dramatically declined the vaccination rate for girls born after  was less than     although the vaccine coverage rate varies among countries studies conducted in countries with national hpv vaccination programs have demonstrated clear benefits of mass vaccination in reducing viral prevalence and associated disease burden  in addition three doses of hpv vaccine are recommended for young female adults aged  years  however in japan the threedose completion rate remains low without government interventions  and more importantly  despite the merits of implementing hpv vaccination programs for young female adults insufficient work has been done to improve this situation worldwide including in japan although efforts have been made to educate the public about the efficacy and merits of the hpv vaccine in the united states the vaccination coverage rate for tetanus diphtheria and pertussis vaccines was approximately   whereas  millions of those eligible for the hpv vaccine were reported to be unvaccinated  furthermore there was a decline in hpv vaccine uptake in ireland owing to increased parental concern over misinformation about the vaccine disseminated by a lobby group set up in   thus it is necessary to improve the knowledge regarding the hpv vaccine for cervical cancer and vaccination health literacy among the younger generation   the japanese ministry of health labour and welfare mhlw reinstated the official active recommendation for hpv vaccination in november  despite this we believe that unless health literacy about cervical cancer and the hpv vaccine among young women who are eligible for vaccination improves it is likely that vaccination uptake will remain sluggish  moreover approximately  years of declining hpv vaccination rates and public confidence during this period may pose difficulty in increasing the hpv vaccination rate among young female adults in japan therefore we aim to conduct a randomized study using different methods of providing medical information printbased and social networking service snsbased educational interventions to improve health literacy regarding cervical cancer and hpv vaccination among female students in japan for the purpose of this study an snsbased innovative informatics platform for unvaccinated young female adults to facilitate accurate hpv vaccination and vaccination completion rates was developed to the best of our knowledge this study will be the first randomized trial to investigate whether an snsbased intervention increases knowledge of vaccination and hpv outcomes among young women in japan following the discontinuation of hpv vaccine recommendations by the government in this paper we present the results of a p and discuss recent topics related to hpv vaccination in japanthe study included  female students from  departments of institutes of a private university group including teikyo university  students teikyo heisei university  students and teikyo institute of advanced nursing  students figure the inclusion criteria were young female students  aged  years  who had received less than three doses of the hpv vaccine or were unvaccinated and  who could access and use snsbased programs and followup questionnaires exclusion criteria were those students  who faced mental and physical challenges using snsbased programs and  who had completed three doses of the vaccine all students and their parents provided written informed consent the study was approved by the institutional review board of teikyo university a data monitoring committee was not deemed necessary for this feasibility study as we did not anticipate any adverse events nonetheless any unintended consequences of the interventions were recordeda clusterrandomized parallelgroup trial with three groups was conducted group  no intervention control group  educational intervention printbased education and group  educational intervention snsbased education the presence or absence of an educational effect was determined by comparing groups  and  with group  for discussion purposes figure a faculty or department and the allocation unit are considered as clusters allocators will prepare an allocation table using a stratified block randomization method with two stratification factors medicalnonmedical institution teikyo university  teikyo institute of advanced nursing studies and teikyo heisei university this will be an openlabel study and both the  and participants will know the allocation resultsthe medical information and educational tools on cervical cancer and hpv vaccination developed by the principal investigator which will be distributed to female students every six months will be randomly assigned to three arms arm  no intervention control arm  distributed by mail and arm  distributed through sns line facebook and twitter on websites figure  all three arms will be followed up for  months during which each intervention arms  and  will be conducted three times at month intervalsa questionnaire will be sent to three randomly allocated groups at the time of enrolment baseline the research secretariat will deliver the allocation results to the enrollees when sending the baseline questionnaire either by post in a booklet form or via a sns the survey questionnaires will be emailed to all the groups and they will receive a final reminder to complete the questionnaires at  months at the time of questionnaire delivery students in the nointervention control group will be informed that they will not receive any medical information or educational tools on cervical cancer and hpv vaccination and will be sent the same questionnaire thrice as during enrolment the primary outcome will be  increasing selfreported hpv vaccine uptake rates via snsbased educational contents from no intention to at least taking one dose or all three doses and  increasing knowledge of susceptibility to cervical cancer its severity and benefit from hpv vaccination as measured by the reliable and valid health belief model  we will investigate vaccination barriers on selfreported hpv vaccine uptake and behavioral intention or attitude changes toward hpv vaccine uptake in support of educational contents between unvaccinated and vaccinated participants who had received a single dose or two doses of the hpv vaccine previouslyparticipants will answer five questions on the communicative and critical health literacy cchl scale ranging from  very easy to  very difficult regarding the hpv vaccine and cervical cancer screening the mean withinindividual health literacy score is the mean of the five questions on cchl a score of  or more is considered highly health literate the primary endpoint will be the proportion of participants with high health literacy scores immediately after the third delivery of educational contents  months in the study the null hypothesis is that the proportion of participants with high health literacy in groups  and  is equal while the alternative hypothesis is that the proportion of participants with high health literacy in group  is higher than that in group  the proportion of high health literacy under the competing hypotheses was p intervention group   and p control group   implying that the meaningful difference in the proportion of high health literacy between the two groups was  the withinclass correlation was  the mean cluster size was  the twosided significance level was  and the power was  the required number of clusters for each group was calculated as  if there are five clusters in each group the total number of required participants is assumed to be        and assuming a dropout rate of about   participants are required we will use a logistic

science and engineering modern life health care health and medical science and medical sports  we conducted a   between  and  in japan due to the coronavirus disease covid pandemic only a few students  applicants participated in the study which was conducted in our laboratory after seeing the participation invite posted in the teaching department information pertaining to students faculty affiliation family background smoking status attitudes toward health and routine vaccination status was collected furthermore the extent of their knowledge regarding cervical cancer and the hpv vaccine was noted although one of the inclusion criteria for study participants was being unvaccinated for hpv six hpvvaccinated students were included in this table   he participants  divided into three randomly assigned groups and sent a questionnaire at enrollment baseline as this was a the number of participants was small to allow comparison between the three groups therefore we summarized the results for all the participants two rounds of the survey were conducted and the results are shown in table the participants had no difficulty understanding the questions and answered all of them responses to item  in the questionnaire indicated a significant improvement in the participants knowledge that is malignant findings in the cervix and excision by methods such as conization increase the risk of imminent miscarriage and premature birth table  although it is widely believed that early detection of cervical lesions is needed to treat them surprisingly it was seen that the participants were unaware that surgery involving the uterus is associated with perinatal risks  the results of the cchl scale are presented in table  as this was a we ensured that the participants understood all the questions and were able to answer them with ease although the number of participants was small for conducting a robust analysis most students provided a rating of  somewhat easy in the first and second survey rounds however being able to understand and communicate information related to the hpv vaccine and cervical cancer screening to others the firstround results were not adequate to draw a firm conclusion therefore we plan to conduct a second round of interventions to assess whether the scores would improve further and if so whether faculty affiliation would be an influencing factortable  results of the communicative and critical health literacy scale first and second survey rounds  currently national hpv vaccination programs are publicly funded in more than  countries worldwide  in japan public subsidies for hpv vaccination began in  and it became a routine vaccination based on the immunization law in april   however in june  the japanese government stopped recommending temporary prophylactic vaccination after symptoms including chronic pain and motor dysfunction after hpv vaccination were reported in young women and brought to light by the japanese media  subsequent investigations have failed to provide any scientific or epidemiological evidence of a causal relationship between the various symptoms reported after vaccination such as pain and motor dysfunction and the vaccination  however the mhlws adverse effects review committee confirmed that the various symptoms reported after vaccination were functional physical symptoms  a nationwide epidemiological survey conducted by the sobue group of the mhlw reported that a few symptoms similar to those reported as postvaccination symptoms existed among people without a history of hpv vaccination  in a questionnaire survey of women born between  and  in nagoya there was no significant difference in the ageadjusted incidence of  symptoms between vaccinated and unvaccinated women and no evidence of a causal relationship between the symptoms and hpv vaccination  the japanese governments decision to stop actively recommending hpv vaccination lasted for  years from june  to november  during this period who criticized japan for exposing young women to the risk of inherently preventable hpvrelated cancers  meanwhile australia published a simulation showing that it would become the first country in the world to eliminate new cervical cancer cases by   in sweden hpv vaccination in women aged  years is expected to significantly reduce the risk of invasive cervical cancer at the national level  furthermore in denmark which has experienced a temporary drop in hpv vaccination coverage due to the media  a study found no causal adverse relationship between the quadrivalent hpv vaccine and possible symptoms     the efficacy of hpv vaccine outweighs the risk of adverse symptoms therefore the hpv vaccination rate is on the rise as japanese mhlw resumed actively recommending the hpv vaccine program in november  in addition due to the covid pandemic peoples physical and emotional barriers to vaccination to prevent transmission of the virus gradually eased  thus as the covid vaccination coverage in japan is over  more young women are keen to resume getting vaccinated for hpv   we conducted a that compared the knowledge of cervical cancer and the hpv vaccine among female students before and after the distribution of printbased and snsbased educational contents due to the small number of students included in the analysis it was impossible to draw any firm conclusions however the results showed a general tendency for improvement in knowledge although nonmedical students may have found it difficult to understand the educational contents their participation in the study could have led them to seek more knowledge through the internet furthermore participants health literacy improved as indicated by the results of the second survey however as the data were not adequate we were unable to compare the three groups and comment on the impact of the educational interventions on knowledge nonetheless the motivation to participate in the study alone could likely indicate a behavioral change in the participants   in the future we hope to reach our target of  participants the study aims to include female students aged  who have missed their routine vaccination periods and are not yet eligible for vaccination after the japanese mhlw has resumed active vaccination currently there is an ongoing debate in japan about subsidizing catchup vaccinations and there has been no decision on introducing the more promising valent vaccine as a routine vaccine students who wish to be vaccinated prior to the catchup vaccination scheme must pay for them moreover many of them have been selfinoculated therefore it is crucial that we especially medical professionals inform them about routine hpv vaccination and the risk of cervical cancer which often affects women in their s and s based on accurate scientific knowledge some studies have analyzed knowledge and awareness about cervical cancer and hpv vaccines in other countries  but few such studies exist in japan this study targeting japanese female university students who have not received the hpv vaccine aims to work with the students through intervention and research to determine their views on health care moreover the results of this study could help improve knowledge and awareness of cervical cancer among young women   there is a need for continued grassroots efforts to improve knowledge of cervical cancer and hpv vaccination among female students in japan medical professionals including obstetricians and gynecologists need to take responsibility and provide accurate scientific knowledge regarding cervical cancer to female students and their parents furthermore efforts need to be made to eradicate cervical cancer finally we continue to recruit

Research paper_Journal article,KUWAT_105_2.docx,Research paper_Journal article,KUWAT_105_2.docx,the current study aimed to examine the association between social interaction and selfrated health srh among older adults in japanese suburban areas we recruited  older adults as study participants after a threeyear followup the bivariate analysis was examined using chisquare fishers exact test and mannwhitney utests the association between social interactions and srh was explored using logistic regressionthe index of social interaction total scale and social curiosity subscale were significantly linked to older adults srh participants with higher scores were more likely to rate their srh as good than participants with lower scores particularly participants who attempted using new tools were twice as likely to rate srh as good than participants who did not better social interaction can effectively predict good srh we should focus on improving this aspect to improve the quality of life of older adults in japanese suburban areasthe rapid increase in the population of older adults is a global phenomenon akiyama  according to a report from the statistics bureau of japan on september   japans older adult population has reached  the highest level in the world ministry of internal affairs and communications statistics bureau nd selfrated health srh is a subjective assessment of ones health status wuorela et al  srh is widely used as an indicator of healthy aging in older adults kim et al  previous studies have shown that srh is a predictor of allcause mortality among older people moreno et al  wuorela  godaert et al idler and cartwright  indicate that older adults with good social conditions can improve their selfrated health even when compared to those with better physical health to discover more social factors that can affect older adults srh an increasing number of studies have focused on many aspects of social interaction this is defined as the relationship between humans and the environment which is measured by the presence or absence of human relationships in the local community and the frequency of relationships with the environment anme  shimada regarding the studies on social relationships and selfrated health kawasaki et al  used three items to measure personal interaction number of people the participant interacts with frequency of interaction and average time of interaction among japanese people and found that rich interaction with friends and relatives can help older adults maintain a higher srh mukerjee  also analyzed this topic and studied both impersonal and personal aspects thereof among americans her analysis included organizational participation and frequency of spending the night with relatives neighbors friends or visiting bars she indicated that both aspects were significantly associated with srh mukerjee  jhang  studied the link between chinese individuals social capital and their srh in personal aspects and pointed out that respondents who got along well with their parents were more likely to report good health status additionally bennet and lindstrm  measured iraqis personal social capital through a sense of being rooted in the neighborhood and compared the srh of swedish natives with immigrants from iran however most previous studies used only a limited number of items or a single item to measure social interactionin the analysis of cohort data the problem of competing risks occurs when a person may experience only one of several types of events the presence of competing risks can complicate the analysis of cohort data kuk  varadhan  in a prospective study if death occurs during the followup period srh could not be observed in this case mortality and srh are competing risks and ignoring this issue would underestimate the status of srh watanabe et al  in the current study various aspects of social interaction and the competing risk model were applied to fill the gap in previous studies examining the various types of social interaction and considering the effect of mortality may reveal more participants with poor srh after a year followup a year longitudinal study was conducted between  and  the data were drawn from the community empowerment and care for wellbeing and healthy longevity evidence from a cohort study cec this cohort study was performed in  and is still in progress data including sociological medical and psychological information were collected every three years using selfreport questionnaires mortality data were provided by local governmentsin the baseline year  the total population was  we included participants aged  years or older who completed the covariates in full and had good srh as their baseline participants with missing data and those with poor srh at baseline were excluded the final participants in the baseline year were  we followed up with these older adults n after a year followup  participants were no longer participating in the study a total of  participants successfully responded to the questionnaire and reported their srh status and  had died a total of  participants were included in the analysisthe srh was measured using a single question how would you describe your health in general and included four answers excellent good fair and poor those who answered excellent or good were classified as having good srh and those who answered fair or poor were classified as having poor srh specifically respondents for whom srh was not observed because death occurred during followup were classified as having poor srh social interaction was measured using the index of social interaction isi which was developed to evaluate five aspects of social relationships independence social curiosity interaction participation and feeling of safety it comprises  items to measure the social relationship both in personal and impersonal elements and has been validated for use with japanese older adults watanabe et al  the independence subscale consists of four questions  are you motivated to live a healthy life  do you have a regular lifestyle  do you have the motivation to live an active life  do you talk about an active approach to life the social curiosity subscale consists of five questions  do you read newspapers  do you read books and magazines  do you use tools such as the internet smartphones and mobile phones  do you enjoy hobbies  what do you think you can do to help society the interaction subscale includes three questions  how often do you talk to nonfamily members and nonrelatives  how often do you talk to your family and relatives  how often do you have visits with others the participation subscale consists of four questions  how often do you participate in social groups  how well do you know your neighbors  do you watch television  do you have a specific role such as a job or household chores the feeling of safety subscale was constructed using two questions  is there someone you can consult when you are troubled  is there someone who can help you in an emergency each question has four or five responses depending on the frequency or degree these can be divided into positive and negative responses for each respondent a positive response was awarded one point and a negative response was awarded zero points each person received a total isi score between zero and  to indicate the level of social interaction and subisi scores for each subscalereferring to previous studies waverijn et al  age sex exercise drinking smoking economic status and disease status were included in this study as covariables age was treated as a continuous variable sex and exercise were considered dichotomous variables those who indicated that they frequently or sometimes exercised were treated as exercising and those who indicated that they never exercise were treated as not exercising drinking was divided into two categories drinkers and nondrinkers and smoking was divided into three categories current smokers exsmokers and nonsmokers those who responded to frequency of drinking as every day or sometimes were treated as drinkers and barely or never were treated as nondrinkers for smoking we treated the responses daily or sometimes as current smokers used to smoke as exsmokers and never as nonsmokers economic status was also considered as a dichotomous variable we treated the responses poor and slightly poor to economic status as poor economic status and wealthy and slightly wealthy as rich economic status we considered various diseases hypertension stroke cardiac disease diabetes hyperlipidemia respiratory disease diseases of the stomach liver and gall bladder kidney and prostate disease musculoskeletal diseases cancer blood and immune disorders depression cognitive disorder parkinsons disease and eyeear disease if the respondent had any one of these diseases they were treated as having a disease and if they did not have any of them they were treated as not having a disease these data were obtained using a selfreport questionnairefirst descriptive analysis was used to describe demographic information mannwhitney utests were used to examine the significance of continuous variables age isi with srh chisquare and fishers exact tests were applied to examine the significance of dichotomous variables sex exercising drinking smoking economic status and disease status with selfrated health subsequently logistic regression was implemented to determine the association between isi and srhfinally we used the same methods to examine the association between the subscales of isi and srh and examined each item in the significant subscale in mannwhitney utests chisquare and fisher exact test steps  was set to  in all steps all analyses were performed using ibm spss in table  we examine the demographic statistics isi and srh after a year followup the mean and sd of age and isi are  and  respectively among the participants  male and  female the majority have a rich economic status  exercise  are nondrinkers  nonsmokers  and have at least one disease the bivariate analysis table  shows an association between the isi total scale p  age p  sex p smoking status p disease status p  and srh after the  years followupwe then examined the association between total isi and subscales and srh table  in both the unadjusted model p  and the adjusted model p  the total isi is significant however the or odds rate decreases after adjusting for age sex smoking and disease status the same result occurs in the social curiosity subscale both in the unadjusted model p  and the adjusted model p  both of which are significant specifically the independence subscale is significant in the unadjusted model p   however it is not significant after adjusting for covariates p  more specifically in the adjusted model of isi total scale table  the isi scores or   and ci   are associated with srh in the adjusted model of the social curiosity subscale the statistical results show that the isi scores or   and ci   are associated with srhfinally we examined the items in the social curiosity subscale and found that trying to use new tools is significant p or   ci   the current study examined the association between various aspects of social interaction and srh among older adults living in japanese suburban areas the results show that the total isi score and social curiosity subscale can predict better srh in japanese older adults however the statistical evidence shows that there are no statistically significant differences in the independence interaction feeling of safety and participation subscalesisi was measured in five aspects previous studies have shown that promoting social interaction may lead to better srh and that this effect increases with age lee et al  they also show that the quantity of social relationships is positively associated with srh fiorillo et al we also found that richer social interactions can predict good srh for japanese older adults additionally the competing risk model contributed  poor srh outcomes to the study that originally should have been included as lost to followup this increases the sample size and improves the accuracy of the outcome the social curiosity subscale was measured using five items reading newspapers reading books or magazines trying to use new tools developing a hobby and having a feeling of importance a previous study showed that curiosity plays an important role in maintaining cognitive functioning mental health and the physical wellbeing of older people sakaki et al  in the current study we also found a positive effect of the social curiosity subscale on srh the item analysis showed that trying to use new tools contributed significantly to this subscale trying to use new tools such as the internet is thus beneficial to health a crosssectional study based on swedish older adults showed that the internet can inform and educate older adults allowing them to actively participate in society falk erhag et al  and reduce isolation falk erhag et al  marchant et al  many studies have shown that the internet can significantly improve srh in older adults lyu  sun  gracia  herrero  in addition using video calling can reduce the social isolation of older adults chen  schulz  especially during the covid pandemic noone et al  the current rapid development of technology embracing social curiosity and trying to use new tools can provide more opportunities for older adults to engage in social interaction and enhance their srhthe current study considered the association between social interaction and srh in older adults more comprehensively in five aspects compared to previous studies it also included death in the model for the first time in srh the results were thus more consistent with the actual situation than those of previous studies additionally in contrast to other studies based on japanese people over the age of  kawasaki et al  we included individuals over  years of age in the study because social interaction has the same positive effect on those aged  yearshowever our study has some limitations first the sample size was small and we could not include more covariables such as living status education level and household such as in previous studies second the followup period was too short if the followup period is extended we can verify the effect of isi on srh in the long term third three years went by without the examination of changes in srhafter the three year followup we found that social interaction especially social curiosity was strongly associated with srh in japanese older adults who live in japans suburban area this finding provides a direction for improving srh in older adults increasing social interaction remaining curious about society and especially trying to use new tools can significantly increase srh levels and reduce social isolation in older adultsanme t  shimada c  social

Research paper_Journal article,KVGQR_25.docx,Research paper_Journal article,KVGQR_25.docx,investigation on indoor thermal environment and air quality assessment of apartment buildings in shenzhenabstract indoor thermal environment and air quality have a significant impact on human health and comfort this study evaluated the indoor environmental conditions of two apartments in shenzhen in spring winter and summer and conducted a questionnaire survey on the residents in the apartments to analyze the difference of their thermal sensation at the same time  questionnaires were collected including  in spring  in winter and  in summer the temperature range of residents in the apartment in spring winter and summer is c c  c and c in addition the indoor air quality of the apartment was evaluated and analyzed it was found that the indoor mold breeding was serious and the air quality was poor through gene sequencing analysis it is concluded that air conditioning is the main source of indoor microbial pollution and indoor high humidity area is the main microbial aggregation at the same time the types of indoor microorganisms are also correlated with seasons the results of this study can guide the indoor thermal environment of apartments and create good air quality so as to improve the comfort of residentsindoor thermal environment and air quality have a significant impact on human health and comfort although some studies have focused on investigating the thermal comfort and environment of residential office and educational buildings under different climatic conditions  similar studies on apartment buildings are very limited early studies on apartment ambient temperature and humidity mainly focused on the air quality of indoor residents but did not emphasize its impact on infection bacterial growth and bacteria in the air with the rapid economic growth and the improvement of living standards the focus of apartment design includes functionality and occupant comfort in indoor environmental quality indoor thermal environment and air quality factors have a particularly significant impact on human comfort  understanding and adjusting the temperature humidity and air quality in the apartment to evaluate the thermal comfort of residents is very important to protect the health of indoor residents however there is still a lack of research on the changes of thermal environment and air quality of these apartments and their subsequent impact on indoor residentsalthough there are many studies on the indoor environmental quality of green office buildings and the data are relatively perfect there are few studies on the indoor air quality of apartment buildings with the development of economy and the rise of various long rent and short rent apartments people begin to pay attention to indoor air quality while solving the problem of sleep indoor air quality directly affects residents health and living comfort and today with the vigorous promotion of building energy conservation due to the increase of building tightness indoor pollutants can not be eliminated in time resulting in poor indoor air quality and people will be infected with various sick building syndrome  in the relevant research on indoor air quality the influence degree of pm co formaldehyde and tvoc concentration  on air quality is analyzed respectively but the research on microorganisms in indoor air is extremely lacking in china however with the emergence of various respiratory diseases and infectious diseases we have to pay attention to the impact of pathogenic or non pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria fungi and viruses on residents health compared with china apartment indoor microbial research has been widely studied all over the world including the united states   australia china britain south korea etc according to these studies indoor space usually has a unique community structure of bacteria and fungi  among the bacteria in the air grampositive bacteria micrococcus staphylococcus and bacillus are the most common genera in houses the study found that the community structure of bacteria in the apartment is different in different areas and there are great differences between different seasons in the same place in addition there are some reports that more microbial species are found in the apartment room area with high humidity these microorganisms floating in the air will contact with water regularly to breed and reproduce such as toilets bathrooms air conditioning outlets etc   at the same time indoor airborne bacteria are also regular in seasons mainly due to the changes of outdoor airborne bacteria through ventilation and infiltration in most studies the concentrations of bacteria and fungi were higher in summer which may be due to higher temperature and relative humidity but there was no significant difference among the four seasons p   analysis of variance therefore in order to better indoor air quality and human health it is also very important to characterize the impact of microorganisms on air qualityto sum up in this investigation in order to create a better indoor thermal environment for apartments a field survey and measurement of indoor thermal comfort and air quality was conducted in south china shenzhen city the variation of thermal parameters and concentration of air pollution was analysis in addition bacteria and mould were collected and analyzed to ensure the health of indoor residents and promote the further development of the apartment buildingsshenzhen city is located on the coast of the south china sea and belongs to a typical subtropical marine humid monsoon climate it is affected by southeast wind and southwest wind all the year round winter is milder than winter while summer is long and humid with abundant rainfall strong solar radiation and high moisture content in the air it belongs to a high temperature and high humidity climate area july and august are the hottest months the highest outdoor temperature in july often exceeds   the annual average relative humidity changes the least  although it occasionally increases to more than  at present two landsea apartments in shenzhen have been studied evaluated and investigated in spring and winterthe survey was conducted on typical working days in december  winter and march  spring the apartment room is considered a pilot area the test area is equipped with air conditioning in summer and natural ventilation in winterthe thermal environment parameters studied in this study are air temperature ta relative humidity rh air velocityva and globe temperature tg the test instrument used is thermal comfort instrument ssdzy which meets the range and accuracy specified in iso  the location of the test point has been negotiated with the person in charge of the apartment to promote the normal operation of the apartment and ensure the safety of the instrument the test point is located near the center of the residents room the instrument shall be placed near the sitting subject with a height of m  and it shall not be placed near the heat source and cold sourcein this field survey multiple measuring instruments are arranged in different resident rooms and the instrument layout is shown in figure  in addition all subjects were seated due to the limitation of the field environment the sensor is placed m above the ground generally speaking this height is very close to the height of the subjects head due to the limitation of test conditions the indoor parameter test time is  hoursat the same time a research team composed of undergraduate students majoring in building biochemical engineering and graduate students majoring in heating gas supply ventilation and air conditioning engineering conducted indoor microbial sampling tvoc concentration measurement and air quality questionnaire surveyin order to provide a stable sampling environment during the sampling period the air conditioner does not operate and the doors and windows are closed in this study the main instrument for collecting air bacterial strains is the planktonic microbial sampler hkm  which is used to collect bacteria in the air from the master bedroom guest room and bathroom before each sampling the sampler is disinfected with  ethanol bacteria were collected using nutrient agar dishes after the alcohol is completely evaporated put the agar dish into the sampler according to the national indoor air quality standard the sampling point is selected at the center of each room the sampling height is m which is close to the human respiratory area each sample was collected at a flow rate of lmin for  minutes each sampling location is then sampled three times immediately after sampling all petri dishes were stored in sterile bags and returned to the laboratory for further culturein addition the planktonic microorganism sampler is carried out in a completely closed indoor environment and the bacteria are collected with nutrient agar fungi were collected in sabouraud agar medium both strains are collected by natural sedimentation method and impact method  and the sampling points are in different positions and corridors of typical rooms the sampling time of each group is about  minutes and the sampling height is  meters which is about close to the respiratory area of people  during the sampling process the number of people shall be controlled within  to avoid the influence of human factorstvoc concentration tester is used under indoor ventilation and closed ventilation the test time of each group is  hour test  groups and take the average value the sampling and measurement process is shown in figure the research team consists of undergraduate students majoring in building environment and energy application engineering and graduate students majoring in heating gas supply ventilation and air conditioning engineering all members are familiar with the questionnaire and survey dialogue methods participants were asked to fill in the questionnaire after the researchers explained the content to ensure the accuracy of the answers a total of  questionnaires were collected during the study including  responses in spring  responses in winter and  responses in summer there are  male members and  female members the activity state is sitting still and standing with slight activity the age group of subjects is concentrated in  years old and the residents are mostly young people table  lists the physical characteristics of the questionnaire participantsthe survey contents include the current dressing situation of apartment personnel activity status basic information of subjects satisfaction with indoor thermal environment and relevant parameters of air quality satisfaction the activity questionnaire shall be filled in at the same time as the field test and the questionnaire work shall be carried out in a period of min the thermal environment in the questionnaire adopts the grade  scale recommended by ashrae standard as shown in table the indoor air quality was evaluated and analyzed from two aspects the collected indoor microorganisms and the measured indoor tvoc concentrationcombined with the identification of dna sequencing the main dominant strains in the room were analyzed the cultured strain dna was sequenced by pairedend based on illuminanovaseq sequencing platform after reading splicing filtering and otus operational taxonomic units clustering species annotation and abundance analysis can be carried out adopt  alphadiversity and  beta diversity analysis can not only reveal the differences in species composition and community structure among samples but also carry out personalized analysis and indepth data mining according to project needs using vsearch software with  similarity cutoff primer sequence removal and clustering were performed on clean readings to generate operable taxonomic units otus  based on the sequence number of each otu the relative abundance of a specific otu for each sample is obtained the relative abundance of the top  genera in the genus level was analyzed and the genera with relative abundance   were defined as the dominant genera in each seasonthe indoor tvoc concentration in different rooms and seasons is compared to determine the distribution of indoor volatile organic pollutants and compared with the existing relevant standards to determine whether the indoor tvoc concentration exceeds the standard the acceptance of indoor air quality by apartment residents is analyzed through questionnaire surveyduring the investigation in order to observe the changes of outdoor environment during the test day outdoor environmental parameters have been continuously recorded and the statistics of test results are shown in figure  according to the meteorological conditions of outdoor test from the end of november to the middle of december represents the winter in shenzhen from the beginning of march to the end of april represents the spring in shenzhen and from the end of august to the end of september represents the summer in shenzhenduring the investigation period the temperature and humidity in winter were relatively low with an average temperature of c the average relative humidity is  in spring the temperature is maintained in the range of c and the temperature change trend is obvious and the relative humidity is distributed in  in summer the temperature fluctuates within the range of c and the relative humidity is high above  this is mainly because shenzhen is affected by southeast wind and southwest wind all the year round the spring and winter seasons are milder than before and the summer is longer and humid it has abundant rainfall strong solar radiation and high moisture content in the airall the apartments tested are equipped with an air conditioner during the spring test it is in the intermittent cooling state indoor residents set the working time of the air conditioner according to their own cold and hot feeling in winter the air conditioner is not turned on the indoor is in the natural ventilation state and in summer it is in the air conditioning state table  lists the maximum minimum and average values of environmental parameters air temperature relative humidity and wind speed during the study period the temperature distribution in the apartment is about c in spring and about  of the test time the indoor temperature is above c and the maximum temperature is c indicating that in most of the time the indoor temperature of the apartment is maintained in a relatively stable temperature range which is in line with the comfortable temperature in the apartment obtained by other studies the indoor temperature is widely distributed in winter which is also due to the large change of outdoor temperature it is mainly distributed at about c and the highest frequency occurs between c in summer the temperature distribution in the apartment is between c and about  of the test time the indoor temperature is above c and the maximum temperature is c indicating that the indoor temperature of the apartment is maintained in a high temperature range most of the time the average value of indoor wind speed in winter is ms in spring is ms due to the high temperature in spring the intermittent opening of indoor air conditioner and fan will increase the wind speed to a certain extent in winter due to the decrease of temperature the air conditioner and fan are closed and the doors and windows are tightly closed in addition the apartment corridor structure leads to extremely low indoor wind speed which basically belongs to a windless state the average value of indoor wind speed in summer is ms because the indoor air conditioner in the survey room does not work in summer and the doors and windows are closed the wind speed is lowthe indoor relative humidity in spring is relatively high basically more than  which may be due to the slow indoor air flow rate the indoor humidity can not be replaced through air circulation and the water spaces such as single apartment toilet and toilet are closely connected with the bedroom resulting in the high indoor relative humidity in winter the indoor relative humidity is relatively low generally distributed between  in winter the indoor tightness is good and the air circulation is poor resulting in the inability of outdoor wet air to enter the room resulting in low indoor humidity in summer the indoor relative humidity is higher basically above the indoor average tvoc concentration of different floors in the apartment is statistically analyzed and the results are shown in table  in spring winter and summer the hour average tvoc concentration in the apartment is mgmmgm and mgm with peak values of mgmmgm and mgmthe hour mean value of indoor tvoc concentration in apartments in summer and winter is lower than that specified in gbcode for indoor environmental pollution control of civil building engineering which stipulates that the indoor tvoc concentration of class ii civil building engineering ismgm slightly exceeding the specification requirements in spring it can be seen that in general the average tvoc concentration in the apartment meets the standard but the indoor average tvoc concentration is high in the transition season moreover the closing and opening of doors and windows in the room did not cause significant difference in indoor tvoc concentration the possible reason is that the air exchange speed inside and outside the room is too slow and there is basically no wind speed in the room which did not affect the indoor air pollutant concentration of formaldehyde benzene toluene xylene and total volatile organic compoundsthe planktonic microorganism sampler is used in the apartment to collect indoor bacteria and fungi in a completely enclosed indoor environment bacteria were collected with nutrient agar and fungi were collected with sabouraud agar medium both strains were collected step by step by natural sedimentation method and impact method through the statistical analysis of the colony number on the petri dish in different seasons after culture the quantitative distribution of bacteria and fungi in the apartment room in different seasons is determinedstatistical analysis of bacterial colony number of bacteria and mould cultured in different seasons is shown in table according to the statistics and culture analysis of bacterial and fungal colonies the number of bacterial and fungal colonies in indoor air in summer is small and according to the hygienic standard for hotel industrygb the number of colonies collected by sedimentation method in  star hotels hotels non star hotels with air conditioning and hotels should be it can be seen that in terms of colony number the number of colonies in each room of the apartment in summer meets the standard in spring and winter the number of bacterial and fungal colonies in the apartment is far greater than the standard and the indoor microbial pollution is serious this can be seen from the fact that the musty smell in the apartment in spring and winter is far more serious than that in summer at the same time by analyzing different indoor measuring points it can be seen that the number of colonies hand washing tableair conditioning outletcornerindoor air the possible reason is that the air conditioning outlet is the main microbial pollution source indoor bacteria and molds spread indoors through air flow and grow and reproduce well in the environment of toilet hand washing table with high humidity so as to further pollute the indoor environmentthrough the indoor air sampling in three seasons in the apartment the gene sequencing results show that the breeding of indoor bacteria and molds is more serious in spring and winter with a wide variety and high abundance of bacteria and molds in summer due to the high temperature the air conditioner in the research room has not been used for a long time and the indoor humidity is relatively low there are few bacterial species almost no fungal species and low concentrations in the air sampled in summer therefore only bacteria and molds were analyzed in spring and winterthe statistics of the number of indoor bacterial otus in the apartments of guanlan gl in shenzhen in spring w and winter s are shown in fig  by analyzing the number of indoor bacterial otus in shenzhen guanlan landsea apartment in winter and spring it can be seen that in spring the number of otus in the investigated rooms in the apartment is  and the number of otus in rooms on the nd floor f th floor f and th floor f are   and  respectively that is the number of indoor bacterial species is   and  in winter the total number of otus in the survey rooms in the apartment is  and the number of mold species in the rooms on the second floor f the fourth floor f and the sixth floor f in the apartment is   and  it can be seen intuitively that the number of indoor bacteria in winter is more than that in spring at the same time by analyzing the number of otus shared by each survey room in the apartment in spring and winter it can be seen that there is little difference in bacterial species in the apartment in the same season and most bacterial species are similarat the same time by analyzing the number of indoor bacterial otu in guanlan and yuanling two landsea apartments in winter it can be seen that the bacterial species in landseas guanlan store room is higher than that in landseas yuanling store room it shows that there are differences in bacterial species in apartment rooms in different areas in the same seasonbacterial otus analysis was carried out in different indoor areas of the investigated apartment rooms rooms   and  respectively as shown in figure  the main locations are air conditioning port ac room wall w and indoor air a it can be seen from the figure that the number of bacterial outs everywhere is air conditioning port ac  indoor air a  wall w indoor air conditioning in apartments is the main accumulation source of various kinds of bacteriathe mould otus in the apartment in spring and winter are analyzed and the results are shown in figures  by analyzing the number of indoor mold otus in shenzhen guanlan landsea apartment in winter and spring it can be seen that in spring the number of otus in the investigated rooms in the apartment is  and the number of otus in rooms on the nd floor f th floor f and th floor f in the apartment are   and  respectively that is the number of indoor bacterial species is   and  in winter the total number of otus in the survey rooms in the apartment is  and the number of mold species in rooms on the nd floor f th floor f and th floor f in the apartment is   and  it can be seen that there is little difference in the number of mold species between spring and winter at the same time by analyzing the number of otus shared by each research room in the apartment in spring and winter it can be seen that the species of mold in the apartment in the same season are similar which is consistent with the distribution law of bacteriamould otus analysis was carried out in different indoor areas of the investigated apartment rooms rooms   and  respectively as shown in figure mould otus analysis was carried out in different indoor areas of the investigated apartment rooms rooms   and  respectively the main locations are air conditioning port ac room wall w and indoor air a it can be seen from the figure that the distribution of mold species everywhere is roughly the same as that of bacteria the number of mold otus is air conditioning ac  indoor air a  wall w indoor air conditioning in apartments is also the main accumulation source of various kinds of mouldthe collected indoor bacteria were analyzed by principal component analysis pca based on binary jacquard distance to analyze the community structure of bacteria transmitted in the air in spring s and winter w as shown in figure three dimensional principal component analysis pcoa based on binary jacquard distance was carried out for indoor bacteria and molds in the investigation room to analyze the community structure of bacteria and molds transmitted in the air in spring s and winter w adonis test also revealed the variation of bacterial community structure samples collected from the same season but different rooms are close to each other but samples collected from different seasons are distinguishableat the same time twodimensional principal component analysis based on binary jacquard distance was carried out for bacteria and molds in different areas of the investigated room including air a air conditioning outlet ac sinks and wall w as shown in figure the analysis shows that the samples collected from the same room in indoor air a and wall w are close to each other and the hand washing table and air conditioning outlet ac can be distinguished the species of bacteria in places with high humidity and warm temperature such as hand washing table and air conditioning outlet are different from those in the air  the comparative analysis of the seasonal and spatial distribution of indoor bacterial and fungal community structure shows that the difference between seasons is more significant than that in different indoor spacesfigure  shows the relative abundance of the top  bacteria at the genus level the composition of bacterial community in the apartment shows similarity in the same season whether in different rooms or in different low  medium  high floors however the composition of bacterial community in the same apartment shows some differences in different seasons for example the dominant genera in winter will decrease significantly in springin winter bacillus was the most important genus with an average relative abundance of  followed by aquatic bacteria  and paracoccus  in spring cladosporium was the most important genus with an average relative abundance of  followed by streptomyces  and aspergillus figure  shows the relative abundance of the top  mould at the genus levelin summer penicillium was the most important genus with an average relative abundance of  followed by stagonosporopsis  and aspergillus  in spring intestinimonas was the most important genus with an average relative abundance of  followed by bacillus and lechevalieria in order to further understand the correlation between bacterial species composition and season in apartments in different regions analyze and screen the top  species with the largest relative abundance for species classification tree statistics as shown in figure  as shown in the figure in winter the relative abundance of marine bacillus psychrophilic pseudomonas moraxella oslo and paracoccus accounted for the main proportion in guanlan landsea apartment yuanling landsea apartment is dominated by bacillus halophilus pseudomonas cryophila bacillus martensii and acinetobacter reuteri this shows that there are some differences in indoor bacterial species in different areas in the same seasonthe subjective evaluation results of indoor air quality by residents in the apartment are shown in figure according to the evaluation of indoor residents air freshness in spring and summer combined with the comprehensive analysis of their acceptance of air quality it can be seen from the figure that more than half of the subjects in the apartment feel musty smell in the room indicating that the breeding of indoor mold is serious and greatly pollutes the indoor air quality with the increase of air quality level the acceptance rate gradually increases and the acceptance rate of fresh air quality is the highest close to  indicating that subjects in the apartment prefer a fresh air environment in spring when the air quality is musty and stuffy the acceptable rate is less than  and when the air quality is musty the acceptable rate is only  compared with the stuffy indoor air environment the musty air environment is more unacceptablewe observed that in spring and winter the humidity in the apartment is generally high distributed in    which provides water for indoor mold growth and reproduction at the same time the growth temperature of mold is generally    and when the temperature is   the colony growth rate is the largest and the average temperature range in the apartment in the two seasons is just in line with the temperature range of mold growth however because the indoor ventilation in spring is significantly better than that in winter the bacterial concentration in the air of the apartment is higher in winter than in spring the bacterial community composition in the apartment shows similarity in the same season whether in different rooms or in different low  medium  high floors which may be due to the distribution of biological microorganisms in the air flow and residents traffic in the same house resulting in the similarity of different rooms in the same house  however by analyzing different locations in the same room it will be found that the bacterial species in these places will show great differences such as near the washstand in the bathroom the air outlet of the air conditioner etc we will find that these places have more water and microbial sources  indoor high humidity areas are often the cradle of bacterial breeding and toilets and kitchens usually have higher microbial levels than other rooms which is very consistent with previous research results  it is also reported that in finland the concentration of fungi and bacteria in the air of buildings damaged by moisture is higher than that of undamaged schools and office buildings  excessive moisture in building materials will lead to the growth of molds fungi and bacteria and then spread spores cells debris and volatile organic compounds into the indoor air  in addition other studies have shown that poorly ventilated and confined rooms will further improve the microbial level in these rooms  therefore it is necessary to add mechanical ventilation and exhaust equipment in rooms with frequent water use such as toilets and bathrooms to remove indoor microorganisms  in conclusion it is very important to keep the floor dry and clean keep the room well ventilated and carefully check the possible humidity indicators such as mold smell mold spots moisture spots and water condensation in this study the temperature and humidity of two apartments in shenzhen were tested and the thermal feeling of residents in the apartments was investigated by questionnaire and air quality according to the analysis of the survey data the following conclusions are drawnthe winter temperature of apartments in shenzhen city changes significantly with the outdoor temperature and the measured temperature range in winter is wider than that in summer the temperature ranges in spring and winter are  and  respectivelythe bacterial concentration in the air of the apartment is higher in winter than in spring and the bacterial community composition in the apartment is similar in the same seasonthe indoor air quality of the apartment was evaluated and analyzed it was found that the indoor microbial pollution was serious and the air quality was poor through microbial sampling and analysis it can be seen that in winter the relative abundance of marine bacillus psychrophilic pseudomonas moraxella oslo and paracoccus in the apartment room accounts for the main proportion in spring the relative abundance of aspergillus polymorphus herbaceous cladosporium microcystis triangularis and chaetomium globosum accounted for the main proportion in the apartment roomb cao y zhu q ouyang x zhou l huang field study of human thermal comfort and thermal adaptability during the summer and winter in beijing energy

Abstract,KYOBO_731.docx,Abstract,KYOBO_731.docx,resistance screening to pepper mild mottle virus pmmov pathotype p and p in capsicum germplasmpepper mild mottle virus pmmov a member of the genus tobamovirus is one of the most serious pathogens that afflict commercial pepper production and is classified as either pathotype p and p because chemical and physical treatment have limited success for controlling pmmov resistant varieties are considered to be the most effective means of control two hundred pepper germplasm including  accessions of capsicum chinense and  reference accessions known the resistant l alleles were analyzed to select the resistant germplasm against pmmov using bioassay six accessions including it were resistant to both pmmov pathotype p and p developing necrotic local lesion at inoculated leaves whereas no symptoms at upper leaves we have also confirmed that these accessions showed the negative rtpcr products from the upper leaves these accessions can be a novel source of genetic resistance against present or emerging new pathotype and be useful to differentiate l allelscomparison of agronomic and seed traits of common bean phaseolus vulgaris l germplasm from korea bulgaria and el salvadorto compare agronomic and seed traits of  common bean landraces originated from korea bulgaria and el salvador we evaluated twenty morphological traits and performed a principal component analysis pca in pca the first and second principal components accounted for  and  of the total variance respectively the first component had a strong positive correlation with seed size and seed weight whereas the second component had a strong negative correlation with days to flowering and days to maturity meaning that these traits could mainly explain the difference among landraces with different country of origin landraces from korea had higher variation in days to flowering and days to maturity those from bulgaria had larger and heavier seeds those from el salvador had smaller and lighter seed and earliness in both flowering and maturity also the landraces from el salvador had relatively lower diversity than other countries as they were grouped in a small area in pca as a result these evaluation results would provide an important information for selecting breeding materials and diversity analysis on landraces with different country of origin would provide feedback for planning securing genetic resourcesplant germplasm is a part of living genetic resources including seeds and plant materials such as root leaf and stem and it should be conserved and managed to maintain the ecological biodiversity and to stably generate the product and supply food crops plant germplasm can be divided based on a variety of genetic traits as race and clustering according to the similar genetic traits is an efficient method to manage numerous germplasms therefore we developed an algorithm cacgms clustering analysis for categorical genetic traits of germplasms in genebank management system using categorical variables which statistically differentiate the datatype of genetic traits such as seedcoat color seed shape and flower color briefly with newmans modularity method cacgms algorithm combines the hierarchical clustering algorithm using ward method and representativebased algorithm such as kmedoids and regroups all germplasms using the core sets of germplasms when we tested cacgms using  pepper germplasms with  different categorical genetic traits cacgms exhibited better performance than the hierarchical and kmedoids algorithms for the average distance among clusters  and entropy  moreover cacgms exhibited a better performance in terms of threshold from  to  for genetic traits than other algorithms and provided similar results in the test run using tomato germplasm from these results we expect that cacgms will be a useful tool to manage each group with numerous plant germplasms and facilitate the analysis of other studies such as the representative characteristics analysis of clustered germplasms and correlation among germplasms in a particular clusterin korea black soybean has been traditionally consumed as the form of soybean cooked with rice to supplement protein and oil which lack in rice the seed cooking quality such as seed traits after cooking with rice that needed for consumers were not fully considered during the process of breeding in this study we firstly evaluated the seed quality after cooking with rice and secondly correlation of coefficient between the seed cooking quality and seed water absorption ratio was calculated and finally we tried to identify qtlgene using two recombinant inbred line ril populations daepung  socheong daepungilpumgeomjeong based on phenotype and the correlation analysis the main factors affecting seed hardness of cooking with rice may be different in each ril populations in daepungsocheong ril population the one qtl related to seed hardness after cooking with rice was identified on chromosome  and glymag encoding peroxidase was proposed to candidate gene in daepungilpumgeomjeong ril population the two qtls related to seed hardness after cooking with rice on chromosomes   the one qtl related to seed water absorption on chromosome  and glymag encoding pectin methylesterase inhibitor was proposed to candidate gene for the first time a study on the seed cooking quality after cooking with rice was conducted in soybeans and the locations of four related qtls were identified it will be able to be utilized in the future development of highquality black soybean varieties with high consumer preference using molecular breeding methodsdevelopment of fast and simple processing method to evaluate tofu traits in soybean breeding system tofu is made by mixing the condensed soy milk and coagulant since it has low calories with high protein and fat contents as well as various important vitamins and minerals its consumption has been increased worldwide as healthy and dietetic food to be applied to systematic breeding program for tofu yield characteristic evaluation of tofu is essential however to test various characteristic of tofu significant amount of seed which is around g is demanded in this study we proposed simple tofu quality test method which requires limited weight of seeds  g which is  less than conventional method tofu was manufactured using the conventional method tofu maker machine tm and  simple methods natural filtering method nf weight pressure method wp hand pressure method hp rotation machine method rm for  soybean varieties the correlation between the  methods in each tofu characteristic was analyzed resulting to the hp and rm methods were statistically similar to the conventional methods while the other methods showed differences specially in tofu yield the hp and rm methods showed significantly higher correlation coefficient   respectively and the coefficient of variation between

comment it outfootnotesize textsuperscriptnote subtitles are not captured in xplore and should not be usedin this study we focus on delayed bitinterleaved coded modulation dbicm for twodimensional signal constellation and show that the capacity of dbicm is identical to the coded modulation capacity with less delay than before we also consider an appropriate bit labeling scheme based on gray labeling for each signal point which prevents performance degradation of dbicm  we also show by numerical results and simulation results that performance improvement by our proposed methodsbitinterleaved coded modulation bicm citezehaviis widely used technique in wireless communications citedvb when combined with gray labeling the bicm capacity can achieve rates approaching the coded modulation cm capacity citecaire citefabregas citebicmbook recent work on errorcorrecting codes and bicms has received much attention including citehoucitepolarbicm recently a delayed bicm dbicm with modifications to the bicm has been proposed citemaciteliao assuming that the number of signal points is mm the dbicm divides the codeword into m subsequences each of which is divided and transmitted according to a delay slot thus each transmitted symbol is modulated from a binary sequence consisting of different codeword bits in the dbicm decoder decoding is performed after all the subsequences comprising the codeword have been received the decoder can use the information of the delayed subsequences for decoding the nondelayed subsequences which improves the decoding performance this principle is similar to that of multi level coding and multistage decoding mlcmsd citeimai citewachsmann whose capacity is coincides with the cm capacity however mlcmsd requires m types of error correcting codes with different coding rates while bicm and dbicm require only one encoder and decoder dbicm capacity coincides with the cm capacity or mlcmsd capacity when the maximum delay tmax is m for squared quadrature phase amplitude modulation qam with gray labeling liao et al proved that the dbicm capacity is equivalent to the cm or mlcmsd capacity when tmaxm citeliao furthermore they reported that dbicm performs well even when tmax and show that it performs well for various m using optimized ldpc codes the author reported by numerical results that the capacity of dbicm for amplitude phase modulation apsk is eqaul to the cm capacity with tmaxm citehosoyain this study by extending a result of citehosoya we clarify the performance of dbicm for twodimensional signal constellations including apsk and qamapsk is superior to qam in terms of peaktoaverage power ratio papr and is used in satellite broadcast communications such as dvbscitedvb we show the conditions for the signal constellation of the phenomenon that the dbicm capacity achieves the cm capacity when tmaxmwe also consider an appropriate bit labeling scheme based on gray labeling for each signal point which prevents performance degradation of dbicm  we also show by numerical results and simulation results that performance improvement by our proposed methodsconsider a discrete input and continuous output memoryless channel whose random input and output variables are represented by x and y respectively the input symbols are chosen from discrete alphabets mathcalx mathcalxm with equal probability for a uniform input probability distribution pxxfracm xincal x we refer to the mutual information between the channel input x and output y as the textitcoded modulation capacity cm capacity which is

let mathcalxaisinmathcalx betaisa be a subset of mathcalx whose ith bit label is a  in bicm based schemes citezehavi citecaire citefabregas citebicmbook the encoded codeword bmb of length n is interleaved and parallelized into m subblocks bmb ldots bmbm of lengths nm these subblocks are fed into the mapper and is assigned to transmitted symbols according to the signal constellation let b ldots bm be the m binary random variables for the labeling bits of the transmitted input symbol x the channel input symbol x is determined by a onetoone mapping rule phi with b ldots bmin delayed bicm dbicm citema citeyan citewang citeliao we consider t codewords bmb are transmitted through awgn channel and each symbol sequence bmx is modulated by refeqb from different codewords we add the time index t to each subblock which is denoted by bmbt  bmbt ldots bmbtm and tin t where ab denote a consecutive set of integers for some integers a and b ale b let bmttldotstm denote the delay time slots where ti tige  denote the delay time of bmbti i  ldots m symbol sequence at time t bmxt tldotst tttmax is modulated from bmbttii i  ldots m according to mapping rule in refeqb we call codewords bmbt at time t  ldots tmax and tttmax ttmax ldots t the textithead and the textittail respectively fig reffigsystem shows an example of the dbicm transmission model with m bmt tmax in the figure the red colored blocks bmb ldots bmb and the blue colored blocks bmb ldots bmb correspond to the codewords bmb and bmb respectively we set bmbttii to a zerovector when tti is an outside of the range from  to t and hence we transmit tttmax symbol sequences for example in fig reffigsystem the decoding of the codeword at time t can start after receiving the transmitted sequences bmx bmx bmx however in the demodulation some of the subblocks can use the information from the previous decoding results in the present decoding for example in fig reffigsystem demodulation at t decoding for the bmb the decoder can use the information of bmb bmb already decoded subblocks and the allzero sequence bm it is worth noting that the spectrum efficiency of dbicm is slightly reduced compared to that of bicm note that the dbicm capacity discussed in citeyan citeliao is for the body not the head or tail we here explain the dbicm capacity for the body and will explain the dbicm capacities for the head and the tail in the next section therefore mathcald is a set of undelayed bit positions and mathcald ldots mathcaldtmax are sets of the delayed bit positions where iirm dbicmbmt iin mathcaldk kldotstmax is ith bit channel capacity of dbicm where mathcalbibj jin mathcaldti mathcaldti  ldots mathcaldtmax when m and bmt we have tmax mathcald mathcald and mathcald the bit channel capacity of dbicm in eq refeq for i is then represented by irm dbicmbmtib y b b irm dbicmbmtib y b irm dbicmbmtib y b b and irm dbicmbmtib y respectively it is shown in citeliao that the dbcim capacity is identical to the cm and mlcmsd capacities when tmaxm and tneq tneqcdots neq tm ie all ti are distinct values from  to m where a and b are from a chain rule of mutual information and from refeqb respectively at first we show the conditions for the signal constellation that the dbicm capacity achieves the cm capacity when tmaxm next as mentioned in the previous section we also consider the dbicm capacities of the head and tail to design the bit labeling scheme in particular if the performance of the head is poor the performance of the body will also be adversely affectedcaptionconditions for signal constellation that achive the cm capacity by dbicm with tmaxmlabelfigcondwe give conditions for signal constellation that achive the cm capacity by dbicm with tmaxm as follows item as shown in fig reffigcond a for some two bit

quadrants by a and a item for fixed values of a a ldots am all four points sin capjldotsmmathcalxijaj are symmetric against horizontal and vertical axis as shown in fig reffigcond bto satisfy the above conditions the binary reflected gray code or partial gray code are the most appropriate choice for signal constellation it is possible to satisfy the above conditions without using gray code for example in fig reffigcond b it is not mandatory to have gray code in each quadrant as for other labeling schemes the set partitioning sp labeling does not satisfy the above conditionsin addition for

when the signal points are close to each other in the first symbol sequence bmx in the head or the dbicm capacity of the head in refeq is small decoding performance becomes poorin addition dbicm uses the result of the previous decoding to send feedback to the next decoding so if the previous decoding fails the feedback will not work properlywe design a bit labeling such that all bit labels after i bmbetais ldots bmbetaims are zero and the signal points are far from each otherthe target of signal constellations is assumed to be gray coded or partial gray coded in advance to satisfy the conditions in definition refdefcondthe first method is to compare the average energy between the two subsets in each bit and if the average energy of  is smaller then swap the signal pointsthe second method is to reorder the bits in the order of increasing average energy of  so that the dbicm capacities from head to tail is increasedthe bit labeling scheme described in refs are applied to the existing signal constellation citedvb the signal constellations used in this study satisfy the conditions in definition refdefcond so they can achieve cm capacity by dbicm with tmaxmfigure reffigcapa

refshere dvb and opt represent the conventional citedvb and the proposed signal constellations respectively in these figures except for the bicm the rest of dbicms using appropriate bmt can achieve cm capacity in addition to the signal constellation discussed in refs we compare the set partitioning sp with tmaxm for apsk in fig reffigber and we compare the worst case tmaxm for apsk in fig reffigber the most important thing is that the optimized signal constellation with tmaxm and m are almost the same and the best performance can be verified other methods have poor performance and error flows can be observed so we also show ber of the body for these schemes again these signal constellations achieves the cm capacity by the dbicm but overall performance is also poor due to the poor performance of the head and tailwe show that the dbicm capacity with tmaxm is identical to the cm capacity with some conditions we also consider an appropriate bit labeling scheme based on gray labeling for each signal point which prevents performance degradation of dbicm  we also show by numerical results and simulation results that performance improvement by our proposed methodsthe design of good error correcting codes and efficient decoding algorithms for the dbicm systems is yet to be done, documentclassconferenceieeetran ieeeoverridecommandlockouts usepackagecite

Others,NSRIC_363.docx,Other,NSRIC_363.docx,steel is an indispensable material that supports modern society because it can cover a wide range of strength levels at a lower cost than other structural materials however the maximum strength of practical steel is only about  of the ideal strength derived fromits rigidity therefore the original performance of steel cannot be fully utilized steel should be made even higher in strength in order to contribute to the realization of a carbonfree society by reducing the weight of structures such as automobiles and construction machineryone of the factors that hinders the increase in strength of practical steels is the deterioration of lowtemperature toughness which has a tradeoff relationship with strength in particular highstrength steels with martensitic microstructure are prone to have intergranular fracture along the prior austenite grain boundaries i have been researching how to prevent this intergranular fracture at nippon steel corporation the intergranular fracture has been attributed to the segregation of phosphorus p which is inevitably present as an impurity along the prior austenite grain boundaries when tempering at around  however intergranular fracture sometimes occurs even if highstrength steels with many alloys such as manganese mn is asquenched not tempered there were many unclear points in previous studies it was difficult to remove the effects of grain size and strength because the alloy amount and toughness value were directly linked therefore i made model alloys with a constant grain size and i tried to clarify the relationship between the amount of segregation and the grain boundary strength which is the critical fracture stress that causes intergranular fracture the amount of segregation at the prior austenite grain boundaries was measured by auger electron spectroscopy as a result the role of the alloying elements is that one elements other than p such as molybdenum mo decrease the amount of p segregation at the grain boundaries which indirectly affects the grain boundary strength and the other elements such as mn segregate at the grain boundaries which directly changes the grain boundary strength this result was reported at a prestigious international conference on highstrength steels  in addition by designing the grain boundary strength based on this result we were able to receive the worlds first order for a highstrength steel plate developed for offshore structures i received the presidents award in my companyhowever my research has not reached a level at which the lowtemperature toughness of intergranular fracture can be predicted to achieve this it is necessary to develop a physical model for intergranular fracture based on grain boundary strength for that purpose it is required to clarify the influence of grain boundary characteristics such as grain size grain boundary precipitates retained austenite and ausformed grain boundaries in addition to the amount of segregation at the grain boundaries these effects can also change due to segregation so it is a challenging task to elucidate them for example grain boundary carbides are observed to be separated on the fracture surface it is expected that p which segregates at the interface between the grain boundary carbide and the matrix is also involved in this ease of peeling in order to proceed with such research it is necessary to acquire deep expertise in microstructure control and advanced analysis technology that precisely captures grain boundary segregation mcmaster university has toplevel research in metallurgy and has excellent experimental equipments such as d atom probe technology capable of analyzing grain boundaries at the atomic level professor hatem zurob has made remarkable achievements in grain growth modeling  and microstructure control of highstrength steels  furthermore the mechanism of liquid metal embrittlement has been elucidated by clarifying the behavior of atoms at grain boundaries  the phd course in department of materials science and engineering at mcmaster university is the most suitable for realizing this research i have been given the opportunity to study abroad with financial support from my company i would like to complete this research at mcmaster university and promote the development of highstrength steels and i want to be an

Response to reviewer comments,OSYUY_2.docx,Response to reviewer comments,OSYUY_2.docx,thank you for your consideration of our case report id  entitled infectioninduced elevated plasma perampanel associated with hemimegalencephalywe have corrected and revised our manuscript in accordance with the reviewers comments we hope that our revised manuscript has reached a level suitable for publication in case reports in pediatrics  please apply a validated tool such as the naranjo scale to assess the relationship between the adverse effect and perampanel this assessment should be reported in the manuscript in accordance with your suggestion we assessed our case by the naranjo scale since the score on the naranjo scale is  points and interpretation  points is probable it is highly possible that perampanel impaired consciousness in our case we added the sentence we used the naranjo scale to objectively evaluate whether the impaired consciousness was contributed by the perampanel in our case table  the naranjo scale is a parameter reported by naranjo et al in  and is a score that assesses the causal relationship between drugs and clinically disturbing events  in our case the naranjo scale between the perampanel and impaired consciousness was  points on the naranjo scale total score of  points is evaluated as probable therefore we presume that it is highly possible that the perampanel contributed to impaired consciousness page  lines  we also added the  table  evaluation by naranjo scale between perampanel and impaird consciousness  page  lines  and reference  page  lines  it appears that the perampanel concentration increased by nearly  the month prior to admission compared to the concentration the previous month given the long half life of perampanel could the increased concentration be the result of a long term increasing concentration rather than acutely related to the infectionthank you for your suggestion daily dosage of peramanel remain not to change during the period and plasma concentration of perampanel did not perform continuous elevation remarkable change was shown just around administration was indicated which was written in the perampanel plasma concentration on the day  was  ngml and the perampanel plasma concentration on the day  was  ngml since the perapanel plasma concentration increased sharply in  days it is highly possible that it is not a chronic increase but an acute increase associated with fever page  lines  hence we modified figure  of clinical course for understandable  how did you rule out the possibility that the patient was given incorrect doses of perampanel that resulted in the increased concentration in japan medication in house is followed and supported by regular pharmacists in addition clinician and pharmacist always check remaining drugs in this case as well we added the sentence in addition the medical doctor and pharmacist checked and supported daily medication hence plasma perampanel elevation was not caused by inappropriate medication  page  lines excluding antiseizure drugs patients were taking only cefixime tranexamic acid and teprenone as you pointed out grapefruit juice and herbs such as st jones worts are known to affect cypa we also confirm that the patient did not consume such foods or supplements therefore we added the sentence cypa is known to be inhibited by azole antifungal drugs and macrolide antibiotics  in addition to drugs grapefruit juice has been shown to inhibit cypa and the herb st johns wort has been to shown to induce cypa enzymes  in our case the patient was taking only cefixime tranexamic acid and teprenone excluding antiseizure drugs we confirmed the patient had not taken non prescriotion supplement such as herb and grapefruit juice page  lines  were there any changes in the patients therapeutic regiment that could explain the increased concentration fig shows changes in the therapeutic regimen the doses of perampanel lacosamide and clobazam have not changed before this admission only valproic acid has been gradually increased since valproic acid has been shown not to affect perampanel plasma concentration  we believe there have been no changes in the therapeutic regimen that would affect perampanel plasma concentration to explain this we added the sentence before this admission the dose of perampanel has been fixed at  mg the doses of clobazam and lacosamide were not changed and only valproic acid was gradually increased fig  since valproic acid does not affect the perampanel plasma concentration  it is unlikely that the therapeutic regimen affected the perampanel plasma concentration page  lines  did the route of administration of perampanel change that could have resulted in a change in absorptionwe have continued to administer the drugs by oral administration and we have not changed the route of administration therefore it is unlikely that the route of administration affected the perampanel plasma concentration we added the sentence all antiseizure drugs were administered by oral administration and the route of administration was not changed page  lines  if this is a result of altered perampanel metabolism due to a serious infection please give a more detailed and critical assessment and explanation for example perampanel is also metabolized by cyp a and cyp b why would these systems not compensate for inhibition of the cypa metabolic route as you pointed out perampanel is metabolized not only by cypa but also by cypa and cypb we suggest in the text that clobazam which is metabolized by cypa is compensated for by cypa and cypb so clobazm plasma concentration may not have increased therefore as you pointed out we must explain the possibility of similar things happening in perampanels to explain this we explained the difference in metabolism between perampanel and clobazam perampanel is metabolized not only by cypa but also by cypa and cypb but it has been reported that it is metabolized exclusively by cypa  in clobazam it is also said that cypa and cypb are important metabolic enzymes as well as cypa  i cited the literature that ketoconazole which does not inhibit cypa or cypb but only cypa actually increased the area under plasma concentrationtime curve auc of perampanel  from this document we considered that cypa and cypb may not be able to compensate for the action of cypa in the metabolism of perampanel to explain this consideration we added the sentence perampanel is also known to be metabolized by cypa and cypb  if these metabolic enzymes could compensate for the action of cypa perampanel plasma concentration would not have increased it has been reported that cypa metabolizes perampanel almost exclusively and that ketoconazole a cypa inhibitor actually increased the area under plasma concentrationtime curve auc of perampanel  ketoconazole is well known to inhibit cypa but there is no report of inhibition of cypa or cypb since cypa metabolizes perampanel almost exclusively we estimate that cypa and cypb could not compensate for the action of cypa and auc increased in this report similar to this report it is possible that cypa and cypb could not compensate and the perampanel plasma concentration is elevated in our case in clobazam cypc and cypb are as important enzymes as cypa and cypa does not exclusively metabolize clobazam so we consider that cypb and cypa could compensate for the action of cypa  page  lines  in addition we added the reference  page  lines  if would be helpful to have more specific detail about the results of the various tests that were done to rule out other causes of the loss of consciousnesswe perform blood tests cerebrospinal fluid tests urinalysis chest radiography electrocardiograms electroencephalograms brain ct and brain mri to investigate the cause of impaired consciousness and the results are shown on page  lines  in particular electroencephalograms and brain mri are shown in detail in fig to elaborate further we added the detailed results for blood test items that are closely related to impaired consciousness we added the

perform in vitro modulation studies of mirc hek cells and raw cells were utilized why more aaaspecific cells such as aortic endothelial and smooth muscle cells would be more sufficient to assess aneurysm related effects of mirc modulation in vitro a we thank the reviewer for this comment we detected the contents of mircp and mmp in raw cells aortic endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells it was found that the contents of mircp and mmp in raw cells were the highest figure  response to reviewer  therefore raw cells were selected for mircp regulation experiment in vitro hek cells were used

target gene of mircp by predicting the target gene using mirwalk miranda rna and targetscan figure  response to reviewer although mmp was its target gene western blot showed that mircp did not regulate the expression of mmp as shown in figure  response to reviewer  as followeda mmp sequence targeted by mircp in human bc western blotting and quantification of mmp in raw cells transfected with mimic control mircp mimic with or without lipopolysaccharide lps stimulationqhow is the collagen content and fibrotic response affected by mirc modulation this should be analyzed in vitro through soluble collagen assays and in vivo for example via staining for collagen and matrix contentpicrosirius red stains awe thank the reviewer for this comment the mice were divided into two groups at random one group was administered agomircp  nmolmouse each time through the tail vein the other group was administered agomirnc  nmolmouse each time the blood vessels of abdominal aorta in both groups were stained with sirius red staining agomircp could slightly reduce collagen content the results were shown in figure  response to reviewer  as followedab sirius red staining showed collagen content in abdominal aortic with or without agomircp treatment ns vs agomirncqmmp activity should be assessed via zymography this would be important to better understand the regulatory effect on tissue fibrosis when mirc expression is up or downregulated a we thank the reviewer for this highly appreciated comment we believe that this is a very good point as we expected the experiment supplemented zymography to detect the enzyme activity of mmp to better understand the regulation of mmp when the expression of mircp is upregulated or downregulated the result has added into the supplemental

stimulation p vs mimicinhibitor control without lps p vs mircp mimic with lpsq in the introduction section the authors claim that previous studies looking at mirna levels in human aaa were underpowered and included too few samples however the current study also includes a limited amount of patients n in each subgroup could the authors perform a power calculation to stratify how many patients would need to be included in each subgroup to have sufficient power to perform a study on mirna expression and their biomarker potential athank the reviewer for pointing this out we are very sorry that the expression of however published studies often involve too few participants and yield sample types and results are contradictory or inconsistent is not rigorous previous studies mostly focused on european and american populations while we only supplemented the data of chinese populationsconsidering that the study was a retrospective analysis we used pass  to infer the statistical efficacy of control group n   uraaa group n   and raaa group n    and convert mircp nonnormal data   vs   vs   to normal distribution data   vs   vs   in the case of type i error alpha beta value  is obtained which meant having  confidence to obtain the conclusion of difference among the three groups therefore the conclusion of the study is stable and reliable and according to the bilateral test alpha and the degree of assurance inspection efficiency is  the sample size n   was calculated by pass  in other words the sample size is at least  with  cases in each groupq please provide background

clear and the work as some merit however many questions about the experimental plan remains q concerning mice experiments the control group is not appropriate as  parameters are changing compared to the group of interest treatment with angii and diet appropriate controls should be high fat diet only or angii only authors should also consider that wild type mice infused with high concentrations of angii  mgkgday spontaneously develop aneurysms in addition in my experience blood pressure measured by the tailcuff may be not reliable in a mouse model developing aortic aneurysms  a we thank the reviewer for this comment we have previously infused with angii for  weeks using a microosmotic pump which were fed a chow diet and found that the formation rate of abdominal aortic aneurysm was only about  mice were fed a western diet  weeks before angii injection and continued on the same diet afterwards which can better simulate atherosclerotic abdominal aortic aneurysm and significantly improve the formation rate of abdominal aortic aneurysm to more than  moreover compared with blank control chow diet and without angii microosmotic pump apoe    mice angii for  weeks using a microosmotic pump which were fed with western diet were closer to the patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm and healthy population the experiment of injecting high concentrations angii to cbl mice may need further research in future experiments due to limited laboratory conditions blood pressure can only be measured by the tailcuff similarly the blood pressure of mice is measured by tailcuff at day time  pm to  pm as previous report  therefore the blood pressure was measured at least three times consecutively for each mouse in the study the mean data represented the blood pressure at that

resulting from conformity pressure have been widely observed in economic and psychological experiments this study focuses on examining how conformity pressure affects an agents incentive and the principalrqs net payoff using the framework of behavioral contract theory in particular we identify the conditions under which conformity pressure can lead to a positive or negative outcome focusing on the agents heterogeneity our main results are as followsfirst when the conformity preference of agents is homogeneous if the principal can set a performance measure that is congruent with agentrqs productivity conformity pressure is always detrimental to the principal by contrast if it is difficult for the principal to set the congruent performance measure conformity pressure would improve the interagent effort allocation depending on the agents risk aversionsecond when the conformity preference of agents is heterogeneous if the only agent with low effort level feels conformity pressure it may be desirable to the principal even if the principal can set congruent performance measures itemkey words conformity pressure compensation contracts heterogeneity congruent performance measures incongruent performance measuresrecent studies related to peer effects imply that it is becoming increasingly important for firms to design their organizations and incentives based on a thorough understanding of the impact of peer effectsfootnotemany previous studies in the field of behavioral economics especially those dealing with otherregarding preferences have shown theoretically or have been confirmed experimentally or empirically that peers affect the way individuals work and consequently their performance eg citealtfor a reviewkoszegi dahmipeer effects are observed in various situations such as in educationcitepangrist lavy sportscitepgould yamane and workplacecitepichino mas additionally both positive and negative effects of peers on behaviors of individuals have been reportedcitetmas analyzed data on employee productivity in a supermarket chain and found that the productivity of the entire team increases when highly productive employees work in a shiftcitetyamane analyzed swimming data and found that swimmers could swim faster when swimming with multiple people especially when they were being chased from behind than when swimming alonecitetfalkichino found in their experimental study that peer effect increases subjects productivityusing an italian large bank data citetichino found that the employees shirking behaviors increased with their coworkers shirking behaviorseveral experimental studies have found that peer effects have negative impacts on subjects performance citepbellemare barankayin an educational context citetlavy using israeli school data found that the proportion of lowability students erodes the regular students performancein addition to these citetgould analyzed baseball data and found that whether peer pressure increases a players effort depends on whether their teammates are complementary or alternative to themthis study aims to use the framework of behavioral contract theory to analyze when peer effects are desirable or undesirable focusing on the organizational environments and the heterogeneity of individualsfootnotetypical studies dealing with otherregarding preferences are those conducted by citetfehr citetbolton and citetitoh on inequityaversion in particular we focus not only on the aspect of workers observing their peers and working harder but also on the behavior of workers observing their peers shirking and conforming to their behaviorconforming behavior is considered to be generated by conformity pressure a phenomenon widely observed in psychological experiments citepsherif asch deutsch dongfootnoteconforming behaviors are thought to be the outcomes caused by the existence of conformity pressure or peer pressure citepmyers although most studies do not distinguish between the two terms we use the former as we believe that conformity pressure includes not only the positive effect of superior workers exerting pressure on inferior workers but also the effect of superior workers becoming lazy in accompanying inferior workers by contrast peer pressure generally only includes the former positive effect in our model workers agents suffer disutility if the effort level of one worker deviates from that of another in that sense the term conformity pressure better suits our motivationconformity pressure is used to describe the psychological pressure felt by each agent when he compares his action with those of his colleaguesfootnotehereafter we assume that the principal is a female and the agents are males for the purpose of identification only according to citetdong one reason people match their behaviors to those of others is because adopting the average strategy can minimize or dilute risk as it ensures that the individuals payoff is not much lower than the group average another explanation suggested mainly by psychologists is that conforming behavior occurs because people desire to be liked or accepted by other group members or because they desire to be correct when they are unsure how to act in addition to in experimental studies conforming behavior is often observed in the business world in a survey of more than  employees across a wide range of industries nearly half of respondents reported that they work in organizations in which they regularly feel the need to conform citepginofor this purpose we study the role of conformity pressure in the performance evaluation situation and demonstrate when the conformity pressure is beneficial or detrimental to the principalin the model the principal employs two agents to perform a task however the agents care about how much they work or do not work compared to the other agentsfootnotewe extend a len model to multiagent framework where the agents have otherregarding preferences for instance the multiagent version of the len framework is analyzed by citetholmstrom citetitoh citetziv citethuddart citetrajan citetfeltham and citetfelthammost studies in the literatureeg citealtkandel fischer introduce an agent who cares about the peers absolute effort levelfootnotefor instance the multiagent version of the len framework is analyzed by citetholmstrom citetitoh citetziv citethuddart citetrajan citetfeltham and citetfelthamhowever according to the empirical evidence presented above eg citealtichino the peers shirking behavior may reduce the agents motivationwe therefore introduce agents who feel psychologically burdened by the effort difference between themin this setting a peers effort level that is higher than ones own serves as a motivational device whereas a peers effort level that is lower than ones own serves as a demotivational devicethe inclusion of negative aspect of conformity pressure in our analysis is important because it can have negative effects on the organizationmost prior studies have analyzed social norms or peer pressure by focusing on a model with homogeneous agentscitepkandel fischer huck calabuighowever some empirical eg citealthamilton focusing on the heterogeneity of agents productivity and experimental eg citealtbellemare focusing on the heterogeneity of gender studies show that the influence of peers on our behavior is affected by the agents heterogeneityby considering the heterogeneity of agents we can better explore how conformity pressure can be beneficial or detrimentalin this study we analyze two types of heterogeneity one is heterogeneity in agents productivity and performance measure and the other is heterogeneity in agents conformity preferencethe focus of this analysis is on how the effect of conformity preference varies with the characteristics of the performance measuresfirst with respect to the relationship between conformity pressure and the incentive rate the principal raises the incentive rate for a less productive agent and lowers that for a more productive agent compared to the case without conformity pressurefootnotethe results in the homogeneous conformity pressure can explain the wage compression citepegkampkotter without the principals preference for equityhowever when the conformity preference of agents is heterogeneous the principal weakens the incentive rate of the agent who feels conformity pressure and strengthens or weakens the incentive rate of the agent who does notfootnoteusing data from fieldbased and telephone survey interviews citetwidener found that firms with higher levels of team usage use less incentive compensation and align behavior this suggests that horizontal surveillance in the form of peer pressure is a substitute for incentives our results in the heterogeneous conformity pressure are consistent with their study in that the principal reduces the incentive rate for the agent who feels conformity pressuresecond and more importantly with respect to the relationship between conformity pressure and the principals expected net payoff if the principal can set a performance measure that is congruent with agentrqs productivity conformity pressure always worsens the interagent effort allocation that is conformity pressure is always detrimental to the principal by contrast if it is difficult for the principal to set the congruent performance measure what we call incongruent case conformity pressure would improve the interagent effort allocation depending on the agents risk aversionmore specifically if the degree of the agentrqs risk aversion is high conformity pressure has an alternative role for the financial incentives footnotethe central issue of incentive contracts is the effort allocationthis issue has mainly been discussed in the context of multitask agency theorycitepholmstromfeltham datar bakerbakerif the principal can only use a single performance measure in the multitask setting the noncongruent performance measure distorts the agents effort allocation which erodes the principals welfarecitepfelthambakerthe performance measures congruity is defined as the degree of congruence between the impact of the agents action on his performance measure and on the principals expected gross payoff citepp felthamin our analysis we apply the concept of performance measure congruity to a multiagent context referring to citetfelthamwhether the effort allocation between agents is achieved in a way that the principal desires is a key issue for multiagent agenciesour results show that the allocation of effort between agents is influenced by both the performance measure and the agents own conformity preferences and that whether the relationship between the two is alternative or complementary is influenced by the congruity of the performance measurethe results have important implications for when conformity pressure can be chosen as an alternative control device and when it cannotthese results are consistent with the experimental findings in the previous studies that the subjects react more to peer pressure under fixed wages than under piece rates citepeg bellemare since the fixed wage is considered to be one of the most incongruent compensation contracts in the sense that the agents effort is not reflected in the compensation at allby contrast when the conformity preference of agents is heterogeneous if the only agent with low effort level feels conformity pressure it may be desirable to the principal even if the principal can set congruent performance measures in particular since conformity pressure is desirable for the principal when the productivity of highly productive agent is large and the effort level of less productive agent is small this result suggests that conformity pressure plays an important role for instance in startup companiesfirst our model takes into account the possibility that conformity pressure is detrimental to the principalto the best of our knowledge previous analytical studies dealing with social norms and peer pressure eg citealtkandel fischer  introduce an agent who cares about the peers absolute effort levelhowever according to the empirical evidence presented above eg citealtichino bellemare barankay the peers shirking behavior may reduce the agents motivationour model is grounded on the results of these empirical studies that suggest the existence of a negative effect of conformity pressurefootnotecitetkandel suppose that workers suffer disutility when their own effort level is below that of their colleagues as a consequence workers exert more effort than if peer pressure were absent citetfischer analyze how the existence of a social norm alters the effectiveness of monetary incentives they suggest that social norms multiply the effect of an increase in financial incentives on the desirable action and reduce the effect of an increase in financial incentives on the undesirable actionadditionally prior studies addressing social norms and peer pressure in the len framework include citetcasadesus citetheinle and citetabernethy citetabernethy as in citetfischer formulate a cost function under which one agent cares about the other agents effort level on the contrary citetheinle assume a cost function under which the agent cares about the difference in effort levels which is similar to ours however they assume a single agent and the target effort level in their model is determined by the principal the setup of citetcasadesus is different than ours and other prior studies that assume that the norm is exogenously given while pressure is the variable that the agent rationally chooses in other words in our setting we can examine cases in which conformity pressure is effective that is in situations where it acts as a motivational device for the efforts of one agent but lowers the motivation for effort for the other agentin our study deciding whether conformity pressure is beneficial or detrimental depends on whether it improves the agents effort allocation which is the central issue of incentive contractsthis issue has mainly been discussed in the context of multitask agency theorycitepholmstromfeltham datar bakerbakerif the principal can only use a single performance measure in the multitask setting the noncongruent performance measure distorts the agents effort allocation which erodes the principals welfarecitepfelthambakerthe performance measures congruity is defined as the degree of congruence between the impact of the agents action on his performance measure and on the principals expected gross payoff citepp felthamin our analysis we apply the concept of performance measure congruity to a multiagent context referring to citetfelthamwhether the effort allocation between agents is achieved in a way that the principal desires is a key issue for multiagent agenciesour results suggest that the congruity of the performance measure affects the way that the affective factor conformity pressure operates which in turn affects the efficiency of the compensation contractour results show that the allocation of effort between agents is influenced by both the performance measure and the agents own conformity preferences and that whether the relationship between the two is alternative or complementary is influenced by the congruity of the performance measurethe results have important implications for when conformity pressure can be chosen as an alternative control device and when it cannotsecond our study contributes to the literature suggesting the use of conformity pressure as an alternative control methodfor instance citetmerchant expect group pressure to serve as an alternative control system to the standard management control system and introduce group rewards as a way to generate group pressure another study with similar intentions is citetkennedy they observed through interview research that empowerment and visualization increase peer pressureadditionally some studies have argued that colocation or war rooms are effective means of creating peer pressurecitepteasley winterif conformity pressure were always beneficial conformity pressure should be boosted using group rewards empowerment or visualizationhowever as mentioned above the negative aspects of conformity pressure have also been observed and it is possible that unintended negative effects appear as a result of trying to manage employees by increasing conformity pressurecitetcharness in their literature survey study on peer effects argue that pure peer effects do not require interaction between employees and that observability of each others work is sufficient for peer effects to occurtherefore conformity pressure may occur unintentionally and may positively or negatively impact our behaviorto deal with conformity pressure it is necessary to clarify under what circumstances the positive and negative aspects of conformity pressure emergethis study therefore advances our understanding of the mechanisms by which conformity pressure influences our behavior this provides a deeper insight into what kind of incentive system should be built given the conformity pressuremost prior studies have analyzed social norms or peer pressure by focusing on a model with identical agentscitepkandel fischer huck calabuighowever some empirical eg citealthamilton focusing on the heterogeneity of agents productivity and experimental eg citealtbellemare barankay focusing on the heterogeneity of gender studies have shown that the influence of peer effects on our behavior is affected by the agents heterogeneityby considering the heterogeneity of agents we can better explore for instance in what combinations of agents in an organization can it be beneficial or detrimental it is very important to pay attention to the heterogeneity of constituent members in the situation where they have otherregarding preferences citephamilton however to the best of our knowledge few studies analyze peer effects with a focus on heterogeneity of group membersin our study we focus on three kinds of heterogeneity i agents productivity ii performance measure sensitivity and iii conformity preferencethe importance of analyzing conforming behavior is closely related to the diversity of workers characteristics or their manner of working because conforming to others does not matter much in an environment where workers are homogeneous diversity in the workplace is an increasing reality in many developed countries citepparrottatherefore our study seeks to answer how conformity pressure is effective in diverse work environments or workers preferenceswhile many previous studies have analyzed identical agents we analyzed three kinds of heterogeneity i agents productivity ii performance measure sensitivity and iii conformity preferencein particular focusing on the agentsrq heterogeneity allows us to analyze the relationship between conformity pressure and the congruity of performance measures we believe that this is a particularly important contribution to research and practice on the design of management control systemssection  describes the basic setup of our model and shows the result of benchmark case in which there are no conformity pressure in section  we analyze the case in which the agents feel homogeneous conformity pressure we further examine the case in which conformity preference is heterogeneous in section  in section  we summarize our results and discuss how they can be used from the perspective of norm management section  presents the conclusion all the proofs appear in the appendixthe proposed model aims to capture the optimal incentive system when the agent cares about the other agents action for this purpose we examine a situation in which a riskneutral principal hires two riskaverse agents to perform a taskfootnotethe sufficient condition for the rational principal to hire a second agent is that the productivity of that agent is at least as high as that of the first agent we thus assume that the principal hires an additional agent who is more productive than the agent who has already been hired each agent performs a single task to influence the principals payoff the agents action ai geqslant  i    entails a personal cost cai  ai the firm value x is described aswhere bi geqslant  denotes agent is productivity which is related to his idiosyncratic skill levelfootnotewe can consider several types of production functions for instance according to previous studies of textitteam production there tends to be an interaction between agents in the production function citepalchian rey on the contrary although citetcalabuig analyze team production in the norm setting they do not consider the direct interaction between agents effort levels we do not use the term textitteam production because it is generally assumed to be the interaction of agents effort in the production function we thus ignore the direct interaction between agents effort to focus on the interaction through conformity pressure if we think of both interactions between agents simultaneously the effort levels in the equilibrium are affected by both incentives which hampers the identification of the effect of conformity pressurewe assume that  the agents action is not observable to both the principal and the other agent and  the principals payoff x is not contractiblefootnoteseveral studies underscore that observability plays a central role for peer pressure citepkandel falkichino kennedy bellemare in our model we relax the assumption of mutual observability of agents because the main results remain unchanged whether or not we assume itfootnotesome previous studies distinguish between observing and being observed and examine whether the effects are different for the twocitepmas georganasfootnoteeven if one agent cannot directly observe the effort level of the other agent we can derive the same effort levels as the nash equilibrium therefore we can mitigate the assumption that the effort levels of agents are mutually observable if agents payoff expected utility functions are common knowledge agent is contribution to the principals payoff is evaluated by the contractible performance measure y  the performance measure eg accounting earnings hereafter denoted performance measure y is described aswhere mi geqslant  is the performance measure sensitivity to agent is effort and varepsilony sim mathcaln  represents uncontrollable eventsfootnotethis assumption is based on citetfelthamwe assume a joint performance measure that corresponds to the situation in which the agents contributions are not easily divisible since the impact of peer pressure is believed to be stronger in teambased compensation citepkandel georganas for instance in a construction project agents tasks may intertwine or overlap just as some of the tasks performed by the general contractor may precede the hiring of subcontractors and other tasks such as coordination and modification may follow or work in conjunction with the subcontractors tasks citepfelthamin our model each agent has conjectures about the other agentrqs effort level and feels conformity pressure when his own effort level deviates from the conjecture in this sense all agents have an internal standard for a particular conduct concerning what the level of effort should be and any deviation of the actual level of effort from this benchmark generates disutility in equilibrium each agent correctly conjectures the other agentrqs effort level which is analogous to a rational expectation assumption citepfischer  thetaiai aj  fracthetaiai  aj quad i j     textand  i neq j  labelccwhere thetai geqslant  denotes the degree of agent is response to conformity pressure that elicits his conformity to the conjecture about the other agents effort this function depends on the difference between the agents and his peers effort levelsfootnotewe can think of other types of peer effects for instance the agent cares about the performance measure y or wage w of the other agent we assume this type of conformity pressure because it is generated by one agent observing the other agents action or behavior directly such as working time feeling conformity pressure by y or w means that the agent cares about the prior expected value of y or w not its realization because the disturbance terms are not realized when agents exert effort it also means that the substantial effect of conformity pressure from caring about y or w is not that different than caring about a because both y and w consist of a however the conformity pressure about y or w has a technical problem with the len framework because it includes the product of random variables following normal distribution which makes it difficult for us to have closed form solutionsthe characteristics of this psychological cost function show that the agent suffers disutility not only when his peer makes more effort but also when his peer makes less effort thus if the agent feels conformity pressure he works harder when his peer makes more effort and more lazily when his peer makes less effort the higher the degree of conformity the stronger the agent conforms to the otherfootnotethe first derivative of thetaiai aj with respect to ai is thetai ai  aj this term is added into the agents optimization problem without conformity pressure which means that with conformity pressure the agent has less more incentive to work if his effort level is higher lower than the others as mentioned in the introduction although prior studies assume that an agents effort incentive generally increases as his preference for social norms increases in our model conformity pressure encourages effort by one agent whereas it inhibits the effort incentive for the other more specifically citetfischer and citetabernethy formulate the norm function as c ai  s bara where sin   represents the extent to which agent i is influenced by his peer or social norms and baraequiv n sumin ai is the reference effort level for agent i differentiating this function with respect to s and ai partial cpartial s partial ai  bara can be obtained this indicates that an increase in s reduces the marginal cost of effort on the norm or peer pressure function in other words the more an agent cares about the target effort level eg social norm or peer effort level the more he exerts effort compared with them differentiating refcc with respect to thetai and ai we derive partial cpartial thetai partial ai  ai  aj which means that if the target effort level is higher than the actual effort level the agent exerts more effort and vice versa although citetheinle define a similar function to ours the principal chooses a target effort level that is always higher than aithe principal offers to each agent an incentive contract contingent on the performance measure as in the standard len framework we restrict this compensation to be linear functions as followswhere alphai in mathbbr is the fixed component of the compensation and betai geqslant  is the incentive rate for the performance measurethe

relationship between the incentive rate and conformity pressurefootnoteto consider the essential driving force of the model with respect to the propositions and lemmas we focus our analysis on the comparative statics at theta in section  at thetatheta in section  this is because the effect of a rise in theta on the conformity cost partial theta ai ajpartial theta depends on the level of theta itself which makes the intuitive interpretation of the comparative statics more complicated furthermore when analyzing at theta it is easy to compare the case of theta as a benchmark the result of the comparative statics when theta is briefly mentioned in section assuming b  b the incentive rate for agent  with conformity pressure is lower than that without conformity pressure and the incentive rate for agent  with conformity pressure is higher than that without conformity pressureproposition refprop shows that compared to the case without conformity pressure the principal weakens the incentive rate of a highly productive agent and strengthens the incentive rate of a less productive agent when the agents feel conformity pressurewith conformity pressure the marginal effect of the incentive rate for agent is effort level is mi betai  theta ai  aj that is agent i exerts more effort when the performance measure sensitivity mi and the incentive rate offered by the principal betai are high simultaneously he also cares about his peers effort leveltheta ai  aj footnotewe use the expression of the existence of conformity pressure or with conformity pressure hereafter instead of the rise in the degree of conformity pressure since the comparative statics in section  correspond to the comparison of the case with and without thetabecause the agent is distressed by the difference between the effort level the agent with low high effort level increases decreases the effort level to narrow the difference with conformity pressure the principal then offers a higherpowered incentive to agent i than j when there is no conformity pressurethe effect of a rise in beta on firm value x in the case with conformity pressure can be decomposed into three factorsfootnotehere we express firm value rather than the principals expected net payoff in the case of homogeneous conformity preferences because the marginal effect of theta on partial euppartial betai is equivalent to that of  theta

effort incentives which is unrelated to conformity pressureie the effect on mbetathe second is the effect of decreasing agent s effort incentive via conformity pressure because agent  suffers from disutility by expanding the difference in effort levels through the rise in beta  footnoteeven if agent is effort level is smaller than agent js a rise in betai reduces agent is effort incentive through conformity pressure this is because the rise in betai increases agent is effort level and thus reduces the effort gap between the agents since agent is effort incentive through conformity pressure becomes stronger as the effort gap increases the decrease in the effort gap makes agent i less motivated to catch up with agent j the third is the effect of increasing agent s incentive via conformity pressure since agent  feels conformity pressure because of agent s effort level which is increased by betathe second effect on firm value is b because it reduces the agent rqs effort incentive and the third is b because it enhances agent rqs effort incentive thus the total effect depends on the difference in productivity between agents bbfootnotemore precisely defining firm value

desirable for the principal to place less more incentive on agent   with conformity pressure footnoteour model is capable of interchanging i and j without loss of generalityfor instance citetkampkotter investigates the claim that supervisors do not differentiate sufficiently between high and lowperforming employees using an analytical model that assumes supervisors principals prefer equity among agents footnotecitetkampkotter analyze why or when supervisors tend to give performance ratings that are overly reduced relative to true employee performance using an analytical model furthermore they empirically show the extent to which and under which organizational circumstances differentiation in bonus payments affects the future bonuses of employeesour results show that the existence of conformity pressure provides lower higherpowered incentive to more less productive agent suggesting that bonus compression might occur even in the absence of inequalityaverse preference

without conformity pressure betaiby using this expression we can derive the following proposition about the relationship between conformity pressure and firm valueconformity pressure is beneficial detrimental to the principal when the product of the difference in productivity and the difference in the effort levels without conformity pressure is negative ie z   positive ie z  as seen in existing studies of multitask agencyeg citealtfeltham baker and multiagent agencyeg citealtfeltham a principal employs performance measures and incentives to align the allocation of agents efforts among tasks or among agents such that it is beneficial to the principal in figure reffigcon and reffigincon the principal desires agents to align their effort ratio with their productivity ratioie red dotted line which represents the vector of productivity  vecb  b b we call this vector productivity vector hereafter considering the agents risk tolerancefootnotein the case that conformity pressure is homogeneous the optimization problem of the principal for firm value coincides with that for the principals expected net payoff we can thus focus only on the productivity ratio see appendix a in detail footnotecitetp baker mentions that the higher the risk the lower the principals controllability the agents however try to maximize the performance measures to increase their monetary compensationie blue dotted line which represents the vector of performance measure sensitivity vecm  m m we call this vector sensitivity vector hereafterthe value of the agents efforts to the principal is determined by the proximity of the agents effort vector to the productivity vector ie the smallness of the angle between the effort and the productivity vectors and the length of the effort vectorfootnotemore precisely firm value x can be expressed as the inner product of the two vectors that is x vecb veca cos eta where cos eta vecb cdot veca  vecb veca is a measure of how distorted the performance measure is with respect to firm value citepbaker higher cos eta corresponds to lower distortion the impact of conformity pressure on firm value can be decomposed into two effects one the impact of conformity pressure on the proximity of the effort vector to the productivity vector cos eta the other that on the length of the effort vector veca see appendix a for more detail if there is no effort adjustment by incentives agents try to exert an effort that maximizes the performance measure such that the principal tries to bring the effort vector closer to the productivity vector by differentiating the incentive intensity for each agent if there is no conformity pressure then the agents effort vector comes to the position of the green line ie vecaast  aast aast  mbetaast mbetaast as a result of the effort adjustment by incentives however in the presence of conformity pressure the agent tries to bring the effort vector closer to the degree line the principal thus sets the incentive intensity after taking into account the agents conformity preference the agents then choose their effort levels considering the incentive rates and the other agents effort level ie vecadag  adag adag black line if the conformity pressure helps the incentive move the effort vector closer to the productivity vector then the conformity pressure is beneficial to the principal this can be judged by the smallness of the angle between the effort vector and the productivity vector and the length of the effort vector as mentioned earlierproposition refprop indicates that when the red dotted line and the green line are in separate regions across the degree line conformity pressure is beneficial to the principal in this case conformity pressure makes more productive agent work harder and less productive agent work less implying that conformity pressure enables the principal to achieve the desired effort ratio without using monetary incentivesas shown in figure reffigcon when the sensitivity vector and the productivity vector are located in the same region across the degree line it may look as if the conformity pressure brings the effort vector closer to the productivity vector which is beneficial to the principal however in this case conformity pressure is detrimental to the principal because conformity pressure always shortens the effort vector what about the case where the sensitivity vector and the productivity vector are located in different regions across the degree line as in figure reffigincon first as in panel a if incentives alone are not enough to move the effort vector closer to the productivity vector conformity pressure can help improve the former however when the incentives alone are sufficient to move the effort vector closer to the productivity vector as in panel b conformity pressure hinders the incentives proposition refprop indicates that when the red dotted line and the green line are in separate regions across the degree line conformity pressure is beneficial to the principal as in that case conformity pressure enables the principal to achieve the desired effort ratio without using monetary incentives            item eta the angle between vecb and effort vector vecaast or vecadagnext we analyze the impact of conformity pressure in two more specific cases we define the textitcongruent case as one where the signs of bi  bj and mi  mj are the same and the textitincongruent case as one where they are not the samefootnotethe performance measures congruity is defined as the degree of congruence between the impact of the agents action on his performance measure and on the principals expected gross payoff citepp feltham then the following corollary can be derived the results are summarized in table item in the congruent case m  m  conformity pressure is always detrimental to the principalitem  in the incongruent case m  m conformity pressure is beneficial detrimental to the principal if the effort level of agent  without conformity pressure is larger smaller than that of agent  that is m beta   m betacaptionsummary of the comparative statics in the case of homogeneous

congruent case part a of corollary refcoro and figure reffigcon illustrate this caseassuming bb in the congruent case the effort vector without conformity pressure vecaast is located to the lower right of vecbfootnotethis is because m beta m beta  bb holds when b  b and m  mfootnotethe reason we interpret that the agent with high performance measure sensitivity has high risk tolerance is that m beta m beta can be transformed into bb times rmrm if mm then rmrm which leads to m beta m beta  bbin this case conformity pressure moves vecaast to the upper left direction vecadag because agent  suffers from the disutility of making a higher effort level than its peer and suppresses its effort while agent  tries harder to catch up with agent  as a result the effort ratio of the more productive agent is lower and that of the less productive agent is higher which is detrimental to the principalnext we explain the intuition of part b of corollary refcoro figure reffigincon illustrates the incongruent case as in refsgn conformity pressure is beneficial detrimental to the principal if vecaast and vecb are in the different regions same region across the degree linein the case that the effort level of agent  without conformity pressure is larger than that of agent  mbeta   mbeta corresponds to the case when the difference in performance measure sensitivity is large relative to the difference in productivity b mb m and when the degree of risk aversion is high rrcequiv bb m mb mb m in this case conformity pressure reduces the distortion that is it brings the effort ratio closer to the degree line figure reffigincon athis condition corresponds to the case where vecm is located far to the left of the degree line and r is large that is it is difficult for the principal to move the agents effort vector to vecb by adjusting incentive ratesconformity pressure thus helps the principal adjust agents effort ratio which increases firm valuein this case conformity pressure may lengthen or shorten the effort vector however it always lengthens the projection of the effort vector vecadag on the productivity vector vecb resulting in an increase in the principals net expected payofffootnoteif the degree of risk aversion is in a certain range conformity pressure increases the distortion that is vecadag moves away from degree line however in this parameter setting conformity pressure always lengthens the effort vector and the positive effect of vector extending dominates the negative effect of increasing distortionthis is because when the difference in performance measure sensitivity is large relative to the difference in productivity imposing financial incentive on the less productive and risktolerant agent agent  increases the incentive for agent  to work hard through conformity pressure in this case conformity pressure lengthens the projection of the effort vector vecadag on the productivity vector vecb see appendix a in detailby contrast if the effort level of agent  without conformity pressure is smaller than that of agent  mbeta   mbeta conformity pressure increases the distortion that is it moves the effort ratio away from the productivity vector figure reffigincon b  this condition corresponds to the case when the difference in productivity is large enough compared to the difference in the sensitivity for performance measure ie b mb m or the difference in productivity is not large enough compared to the difference in the sensitivity for performance measure ie b mb m and the agents risk aversion is modestie r leqslant rcthis case corresponds to the diagram where vecm is located near the degree line or far left from the degree line but r is modest that is the principal can move the agents effort vector sufficiently close to vecb by adjusting incentive ratesin this case conformity pressure moves veca away from vecb which decreases firm valuefurthermore agentsrq effort ratio is lowered in this case however agent  has higher performance measure sensitivity more risk tolerant and so vecadag might be longer than vecaasthowever since the negative effect of increasing the distortion dominates the positive effect of extending the vector the overall result is that the magnitude of the projection of the effort vector vecadag on the productivity vector vecb is smallerfootnotethere are two special cases one is a case in which the agents productivity is the sameie b  b conformity pressure then has no impact on the principals net expected payoff because conformity pressure neither increases nor decreases the firm value the other case is one in which the effort sensitivities of the performance measures remain the sameie m  m conformity pressure then decreases firm value because the expression z always takes positive value corollary refcoro provides the important relationship between the performance measure and conformity pressurefor instance if the principal can set congruent performance measures such as corporate value or departmental profit for the agents eg as citetbaker illustrates in the context of a multitask agency the performance evaluation system may not function as expected due to the conformity pressure however performance measures for lower managers are not as congruent as those for middle and top managers citepbaker in such cases fostering conformity pressure in the workplace may achieve a more desirable allocation of effort among agentsin addition our results have additional implications for citetkennedy who found that empowerment of employees promotes peer effects  that is if empowerment of employees prevents the use of congruent performance measures conformity pressure may serve as a substitute for monetary incentivesthis is also consistent with citetwidener who suggest that horizontal surveillance in the form of peer pressure is a substitute for incentives by using data from fieldbased and telephone survey interviewsfurthermore our result can partly explain the experimental findings in the previous studies that subjects react more to peer pressure under fixed wages than under piece rates citepeg bellemare since fixed wages are considered to be one of the most incongruent compensation contracts in that the agents effort is not reflected in the compensation at allfootnotein our model the larger the degree of risk aversion the smaller the incentive rate and the closer it is to a fixed wage contractin this section we analyze the case in which each agent has heterogeneous conformity preferences theta neq theta prior studies in laboratory experiments contexts have found that male workers respond to peer pressure more significantly than female workers citepbellemare barankaythe purpose of this analysis is to examine how the difference in conformity preferences affects each agents action and what the optimal incentive scheme is for instance what would happen if the principal in an attempt to encourage competition makes the effort of both agents visible to each other but only one agent cares about the peeror from the perspective of norm management which agent would it be desirable for the principal to put more conformity pressure onaccording to refai if each agent feels a different conformity pressure the effort level of the agent is affected not only by his own degree of conformity but also by that of the other agent because the other agents feeling of conformity pressure affects the other agents effort level and in turn influences his own effort level via his conformity pressurethe principal specifies the optimal incentive rates subject to refai and agentsrq participation conditionlemma reflem characterizes the incentive rates and the principals expected net payoff

conformity pressure we focus our analysis on the comparative statics at thetatheta in the case of heterogeneous conformity pressure in other words we analyze the impact that only one agent feels conformity pressure starting from the case when both agents do not feel conformity pressureitem increasing decreasing in the conformity pressure of agent j if bj  mi betai bj  mi betai proposition refprop shows that the principal weakens the incentive rate of agent i who feels conformity pressure and strengthens or weakens the incentive rate of agent i if the other agent agent j feels conformity pressure footnotein this section we can interchange i and j without loss of generalitywhen conformity preference is heterogeneous there are two aspects that are different from when it is homogeneous first only one agent feels conformity pressure which lowers his effort incentive depending on his own effort level and increases his effort incentive depending on the other agents effort levelfootnotesee the second term in refai second the impact of conformity pressure on firm value and the impact on psychological cost sum of conformity cost and effort cost does not completely cancel out therefore we need to consider both effects simultaneouslyif agent i feels conformity pressure the effect of the principal imposing a financial incentive on agent i becomes small that is the increase in expected net payoff due to raising the incentive rate becomes small by the agents productivity bi by contrast the agents marginal cost decreases as the principal imposes less incentive rate since psychological cost function is quadratic this decrease in psychological cost depends on the effort level without conformity pressure mi betai thus the effect of conformity pressure on the principals incentivizing the agent depends on the difference between bi and mi betai and  bimi betai holds which proves proposition refprop a however if agent j feels conformity pressure the principal can raise agent js effort level by incentivizing agent i to work harder in this case the marginal increase in the principals expected net payoff through thetaj is bj and the marginal increase in the psychological cost of imposing additional incentive on agent i is mi betai thus the principal can increase her own expected net payoff by raising agent is incentive rate if bjmi betai and by

marginal cost of effort then an increase in conformity pressure of agent  is desirable for the principalthe results of the case where the conformity preference is heterogeneous can be summarized as followsfirst regarding the relationship between conformity pressure and incentive rate the principal reduces the incentive rate of the agent who feels conformity pressure and increases or decreases the incentive rate of the other agentwhether the principal increases or decreases the incentive rate of the agent who does not feel conformity pressure depends on the productivity of the agent who feels conformity pressure and the marginal psychological cost of the agent who does not feel conformity pressuremore specifically if the productivity of the agent who feels conformity pressure andor the degree of risk aversion is high the principal raises the incentive rate of the agent who does not feel conformity pressure in the case where conformity preferences are homogeneous the principal raises the incentive rate for one agent and lowers the incentive rate for the other however in the case where they are heterogeneous she may lower the incentive rates of both agentssecond regarding the relationship between conformity pressure and principalrqs expected net payoff when conformity preferences are heterogeneous there are situations where conformity pressure is desirable for the principal even in the congruent casesuch a situation arises when the productivity of the less productive agent is higher than the marginal psychological cost total of effort and conformity costs when that agent feels conformity pressurethis is because the lowproductivity agent who feels conformity pressure tries to catch up with highproductivity agent while highproductivity agent does not feel conformity pressure therefore there is no incentive for the highproductivity agent to match their effort or shirk with lowproductivity agentin organizations where all agents feel conformity pressure in the same way conformity pressure may be desirable for the principal when appropriate performance measures cannot be usedhowever in organizations where only lowproductivity agents feel conformity pressure conformity pressure may be desirable for the principal even when appropriate performance measures can be set for instance in a company where the agentrqs productivity is high and effort level is still small conformity pressure may be effective even in the congruent casecaptionthe effect of conformity pressure of agent  on the incentive rates and the principal when theta  theta  partial

we discuss under what circumstances or for which organizations conformity pressure is beneficial based on the results obtained in our analysisin general previous studies have assumed identical agents and analyzed them in settings where the presence of peer pressure always increases agents effort incentives by contrast we incorporated the presence of heterogeneous agents into the model and analyzed a situation where one agent conforms to the other that is conformity pressure encourages one agents effort but generates shirking of the other agentin experimental studies results on whether peer effects are effective are mixed therefore identifying under what circumstances conformity pressure is desirable for principals would be a significant contributionin this section we discuss under what circumstances or for which organizations conformity pressure is beneficial based on the results obtained in our analysisaccording to our main results proposition refprop conformity pressure would be

established by existing research for individuals with incurable cancer conclusion the conceptual model of total pain of people with advanced dementia is expected to help turn healthcare professionals attention to physical psychological social and spiritual contributors to total pain in advanced dementiadame cicely saunders first articulated the theory of total pain to describe the sum of physical psychological social and spiritual suffering experienced by patients faced with advanced diseases such as heart failure respiratory failure and cancer the theory suggests that the combination of and interplay between these elements result in a total pain experience that is individualized and specific to each patients particular situation  good pain management is one of the central pillars of good palliative care and the assessment of total pain is a critical part of the management without a clear conceptualization of total pain for the patients faced with advanced diseases an accurate picture of the patients situation cannot be obtained  the importance of assessment and management of total pain in cancer patients have been widely recognized among both clinicians and researchers yet cancer represents only a fraction of serious diseases  while guidelines recommend palliative care in other diseases such as heart failure dementia chronic obstructive pulmonary disease there has been little focus on assessment and management of total pain of patients dying from noncancer causes consequently a key question remains can the concept of total pain for the cancer patients be translated to other disease patient populations among noncancer serious diseases palliative care needs of patients with dementia are recently recognized because it has been learned over the last few decades that the clinical course of advanced dementia including uncomfortable symptoms such as pain is similar to that experienced by older patients of cancer and other terminal conditions furthermore older people with dementia often feel confused anxious or frustrated and the personcentered approach to dementia treatment uses positive reinforcement to meet the emotional needs of older people and helps them rediscover their identity   thus the concept of total pain may serve as the basis for palliative care need assessment in order to intervene successfully with people with advanced dementia a complete and thorough appreciation of all possible components of total pain is needed to apply total pain theory to palliative care research and practice in advanced dementia however few literatures have focused on total pain of older people with advanced dementia through a multidimensional lens the aim of this quick literature review is to organize information on detailed components of total pain of older people with advance dementia in a totally holistic manner the authors used a convenient sampling approach to obtain relevant information for synthesizing available clinical guidelines or

endoflife care and dementia the title and customer reviews of the retrieved books were screened for the eligibility to include and any book possibly demonstrating components of total pain of people with advanced dementia were included subsequently in the same way the authors performed a search for englishjapanese translated books pertaining to personcentered care for older people with dementia the authors also included an english textbook book no and two english guidelines book no and  for palliative care for older people regardless of dementia out of their book storage finally to enhance the search for spiritual aspects of total pain of older people with advanced dementia the authors refereed to the first author yhs previous academic papers focusing on such topic the first author yh a

Research paper_Journal article,REENK_66.docx,Research paper_Journal article,REENK_66.docx,indispensable nitrogenous substances in plant defense against pathogens the role and development of plant nlr and alkaloidsabstract in the complex natural environment plants evolve a complex and subtle immune response regulation mechanism to their own survival and development plantspecific defense substances are the core driving forces of these complex mechanisms in which rich nitrogenous compounds have been studied for a long time of which disease resistance protein nlr and metabolite alkaloids are important components nlr protein can specifically recognize the invasion of pathogenic microorganisms to trigger the immune  response mechanism alkaloids synthesized from different amino acids or their direct derivatives can also inhibit pathogens this paper reviews the activation recognition and downstream signal transduction of nlr proteins in plant protection as well as the synthetic signal pathways and regulatory defense mechanisms of alkaloids and summarizes their applications in biotechnology in order to clarify the basic mechanism of plant defense substances and the direction of technological development in the futureplants are exposed to the threat of invasion by pathogenic microorganisms for a long time if there is no specialized adjustable cell and adaptive immune system every plant cell must be prepared to defend against invasion so plants have developed a complex innate defense system  and a large number of cellsurface and intracellular immune receptors to sense various immune signals associated with pathogen infection and subsequently activate the defense system  plants adapt to invading pathogens by detecting the presence of specific pathogens or compounds by different defense receptors in their cells  and the related disease resistance protein is the key component of the defense signal and as the messenger of the whole transmission network it constitutes the life defense line of plants  in addition plant secondary metabolites alkaloids also have a unique defense effect most plants and crops affected by pathogenic bacteria are still rescued by chemical pesticides but the reckless use of chemical pesticides is upsetting the balance of the ecosystem  therefore we need to explore and develop ecofriendly alternatives to solve this problem and the use of plant specific substance to combat pathogens will become a potential trend as autotrophs plants can carry out photosynthesis to convert inorganic matter into organic matter while animals and other heterotrophic organisms feed on plants to obtain energy to maintain life activities just like animals some microbes also infect plants to obtain nutrients necessary for their own life activities in order to resist the attack of the outside world plants have formed a set of multilevel defense system after longterm evolution in the fight against pathogens the first line of defense in plant immunity is to perceive the conservative pathogenassociated molecular pattern pamps or damageassociated molecular patterns damps through plant pathogens or pattern recognition receptors prrs  this recognition induces pamptriggered immunity pti  pathogens existing in host plants transport effector factors to plant cells to deal with pti while plants have a more powerful immune receptordisease resistance protein which monitors and antagonizes the activity of effector factors in plant cells causing effectors to trigger immunity etifigure  compared with the complex and changeable effectors the structure of plant disease resistance proteins is more conservative and can be divided into five types according to their structural characteristics transmembrane receptor proteins rich in leucine repeat structure protein kinase rich in leucine repeat structure serine  threonine kinase toxin reductase and nlr nucleotide bindingleucine rich repeat disease resistance protein at present most of the disease resistance proteins that have been widely studied belong to the nlr class which contains nucleotide binding sites and leucinerich repeats this article mainly reviews this kind of disease resistance proteinsthe plantfixed way of life creates a rich chemical weapons warehouse with some  thousand compounds in known structures that work under stress from various stressors to help the plant resist invasion in about  of plant species alkaloids act as a special secondary metabolite to resist the invasion of pathogens  there are many kinds of alkaloids in plants in addition to being used as drugs to treat human diseases some alkaloids can also play a role in their own defense most alkaloids have unique sources of synthesis and their main precursors are amino acids such as phenylalanine tyrosine tryptophan ornithine and lysine  therefore alkaloids are considered to be nitrogen pools plant pathogens have established a close relationship with their hosts in order to resist plant defense and promote the release of nutrients but at the same time plants produce toxic compounds to protect themselves from pathogens some plant alkaloids show this characteristic it is not advisable to use toxic pesticides to prevent plant pathogens for a long time the remarkable development of modern biotechnology provides an opportunity for the development of new plant varieties with genetic resistance combined with modern biotechnology including genetic engineering technology in vitro culture technology etc the application of special substance of plant resistance to pathogens has reached a new height for example the design of gene silencing based on rna interference has been used to mediate plant resistance to pathogens  taking the young leaves with the highest camptothecin as explants using callus induction and culture techniques and through the screening of excellent cell lines the amount of camptothecin in callus reached  to  of the original plantin this paper we reviewed the recognition and function of nlr protein in plant defense the synthesis and defense mechanism of alkaloids and their application in modern biotechnology and looked forward to their future development in order to make a summary of their contribution in plant protection plant disease resistance proteins and alkaloids have made great progress in the past few years and there have been several excellent reviews related to them based on the excellent literature we more systematically integrate the function and development of plant nlr proteins and alkaloidsthe nlr protein family belongs to a subfamily of proteins within the stand signal transduction atpase with numerous domains superfamily the superfamily also contains regulators of animal immunity inflammation and apoptosis the conservative and complex structure of nlr resistance protein is the basis of its powerful role in plant intracellular immunity it mainly consists of three domains figure the tircc domain connected to the nterminal expressed as the toll interleukin receptor tir domain or crimp coil domain cc which stimulates different downstream signals the central nbs domain is an important component of diseaseresistant proteins which has eight conserved motifs and exists in different kinds of proteins mainly acting on the binding and hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate atp the lrr domain connected to the cterminal is a curved intramolecular or intermolecular protein interaction surface which can regulate the transmission of positive or negative signals and it often has the function of recognizing derivative molecules or host proteins of pathogens  plant nlr proteins are generally in a state of dynamic equilibrium and initiate complex conformational changes to produce defense in the face of dangerous effector stimuli figure  shows the spatial structure of rpmresistant to pseudomonas syringae pv maculicola  rpsresistant to pseudomonas syringae  and rpsresistant to pseudomonas syringae  in the nblrr protein familyfigure  the structure of plant resistance proteins rpm rps and rps and the threepart structure of nlr proteinbiological heredity has something in common animals also have a ternary module structure similar to plant nlr proteinvrnblrr which contains proteins also related to pathogen perception and apoptosis  the  nlr proteins found in humans are classified into five classes based on their vr structure nlra nlrb nlrc nlrp and nlrx nod and nod are recognition factors of peptidoglycan derivatives of bacterial cell walls and trigger downstream inflammatory responses the structure and classification of plant and human nlr proteins are shown in figure plant nlr proteins recognize effectors derived from pathogens and trigger downstream defense responses as a defense sensor nlr protein must be kept in the appropriate cellular position in the correct folding mode and recognizable state after identifying the pathogen the conformation of nlr protein changes or moves and then activates the immune signal pathway any wrong folding or protein state will cause damage to plant cells and cause wrong intracellular reactions  with the support and maintenance of sgthsp nlr can change its structure or location smoothly sgthsp is a highly conserved chaperone complex in eukaryotes consisting of heat shock protein kda hsp cochaperone protein required for mla resistance  rar and suppressor of the g allele of skp sgt the activation of several nlr in different plant species depends on sgt which promotes the folding and accumulation of nlr  sgt has both positive and negative regulation on the level of nlr protein and it can regulate the accumulation of nlr in conjunction with hsp  hsp also has different regulatory functions when interacting with sncsuppressor of npr constitutive  it negatively regulates the accumulation of snc when interacting with rpmnlr protein it positively regulates the stability of rpm protein and some studies have found that rar connects the nterminal of each hsp and controls the opening and closing conformation of nlr  in addition to the role of activating nlr the question of whether cochaperone proteins can be directly used as targets of effector factors remains to be solved an existing report found that the bacterial effector factor hopbf can imitate the phosphorylation of hsp to inactivate hsp prevent the activation of nlr and destroy plant immunity even so more research is needed to prove the defense strategies of cochaperone proteins crtcompromised recognition of tcv can participates in plant resistance to pathogens in early which is a mutant of the chkl atpasekinase superfamily that preterminates atpase proteins crt was originally identified as one of the hrt proteins crt physically interacts with several r proteins besides hrt  raising the possibility that crt is a general factor in r genemediated resistance hrt is an arabidopsis r protein necessary for resistance to turnip crinkle virus tcv  leaves of crtdeficient plants exhibit diffuse necrosis when infected with tcv trigger a hypersensitivity response hr in plants that blocks the spread of the virus  in addition to hrt crt also binds to other nbs domains of nlr proteins and also interacts with hsp but does not interact with rar or sgt and crt may dissociate from nlr and inactivate after the activation of the crtnlr complex  although it is generally believed that crt protein is indispensable for tcv defense kang et al found that crt mutants or crt silent plants could not activate hr response during dpi the possible explanation for this phenomenon is that partial mutation or silencing of crt inhibits its perception or transmission of dangerous signals resulting in the inability to transmit hr defense signals however in the case of high expression level of tcv hr can be induced even if there is partial mutation or silence in crt in contrast when the expression level of tcv is low and crt is also functionally deficient hr cant be induced in general the trigger of plant defense response is the result of the joint influence of many factors which is complicated regardless of the specific activation mode of nlr protein it is certain that this process involves the exchange of adp and atp as well as protein polymerizationsome transcriptional regulators interact with nlr to activate nlr and regulate the nlrmediated resistance process under the interaction nlr and transcriptional regulatory factors are dispersed by physical action redistribute into the nucleus and reprogram the transcription of defense genes to enhance the promotion of defense response for example the barley cnlccnbslrr mildew a  mla is a nlr protein against powdery mildew and the cc domains of myb and mla activate mlamediated defense responses  rice cnl pb produces resistance through interaction with oswrky snc inhibitor tnl can interact with transcription factor bhlh to activate selfdefense plant immune negative regulatory factors are affected by transcriptional inhibitor tpr while snc can interact with tpr and positively regulate plant defensein  based on the study of race specificity of flax to rust flor put forward the hypothesis of geneforgene according to the direct combination of single pita and avrpita he believes that in the hostpathogen system each gene on either side can only be identified under the action of the corresponding gene on the other hand however with the deepening of research it is found that the identification of disease resistance genes to pathogens is a complex process involving multiple proteins which often requires the cooperation of more than one nlr protein and accessory proteinnlr proteins recognize pathogen effectors in two ways direct recognition mode and indirect recognition mode the lrr domain is the region that plays a major role in direct recognition mode for example rice cnl protein pita directly recognizes magnaporthe oryzae nontoxic protein avrpita through lrr domain the lrr domain of arabidopsis thaliana tnl protein rrs directly binds to the nontoxic popp protein of ralstonia solanacearum for recognition flax tnl protein m recognizes the effector factor avrm of flax rustmore studies have shown that some effector factors are not directly attacking nlr proteins after entering plant cells but are indirectly recognized by nlr with the assistance of host cell accessory proteins in indirect recognition the effector released by the pathogen attacks the target protein and the target protein is changed or modified at this time the tircc domain of plant nlr protein detects the change of target protein which triggers the downstream defense rpm rps rps resistant to pseudomonas syringae  and other nlr proteins all pass through this pattern recognition effectors rin rpm interacting protein  was monitored by rpm protein when rin binds to effector factors avrrpm avirulence resistant to pseudomonas syringae pv maculicola  and avrb avirulence pseudomonas syringae b protein kinase ripk rpm induced protein kinase phosphorylates rin and rpm activates plant immune response due to changes in rin in addition rin also mediates the recognition of rps to the nontoxic effector protein avrrptavirulence resistant to pseudomonas syringae pv tomato  of pseudomonas syringae avrrpt has protease activity can cleave and lyses rin and activate rpsdependent immune responseplant cells set a trap for pathogens which is similar to the target protein when it interacts with nlr protein it can induce the effectors to attack it leading to the activation of immune response similar to animal tlr proteins after sensing the effectors of pathogens the tir domain is homologous oligomerization plant nlr proteins can also form homologous or heterologous oligomer or other combinations to identify effectors for example tomato cnl protein prf recognizes pseudomonas clove effector avrpto by forming a homodimer immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analysis with antigen epitope tag showed that the nterminal of prf protein was the functional domain for the formation of dimer this homodimer form a complex with two pto protein kinases to play a recognition role  when sensing avrpto one of the pto kinases in the complex binds to avrpto and the structure of pto kinases changes so pto is no longer inhibited by the nbs domain of prf protein and then the pto kinase bound to avrpto is again phosphorylated by another pto kinase resulting in complete activation of cnl protein prf causing hr responsethere are many nlr proteins that can recognize pathogens with such patterns tobacco tnl protein n can recognize the tobacco mosaic virus tmv effect factor to form a homodimer with the tir domain as the binding site which initiates the defense process rice cnl proteins rgar gene analog  and rgar gene analog  also play a role in the form of complex rga interacts with rga through the cc domain and rga inhibits the activation of rga when there is no effect factor in addition the disease resistance response of prfpto complex also needs the participation of disease resistance proteins nrcab and nrcactivation of specific nlr proteins initiates downstream immunity while some nlr proteins act as signaling factors contributing to the progression and expansion of defense responses for example arabidopsis cnl proteins cnlsadractivated disease resistance  adrl and adrl play a role in signal transduction of eti inducing the accumulation of sa salicylic acid to produce resistance rice cnl protein pb also works by a similar mechanism the common point of adr and pb is that they do not have an intact phosphatebinding loop ploop in the nbs domain and do not need adpatp binding with the signal in eti therefore adr family proteins and pb may be part of signal transduction the plasma membraneanchored integrinlike protein ndr nonracespecific disease resistance  and the nucleocytoplasmic lipaselike protein eds enhanced disease susceptibility  are two important binding sites for nlr proteins involved in the basic disease resistance process ndr encodes a plasma membrane localization protein and interacts with cnl proteins the signal protein encoded by eds is located at the key node of plant immune signaling network ndr is mostly found in cnl proteins and eds is indispensable for tnl because it has been found that hr cell death defense transcriptional reprogramming and sa accumulation have been detected in different forms of tnl defense output ndr and eds have different action sites and mechanisms ndr anchored rin on the plasma membrane to play a resistant role on the contrary the site of the complex formed by eds and related signal factors pad phytoalexindeficient  and sagsenescenceassociated gene  is located in the nucleus and the formed padeds and sageds complex compete for the same interface to balance their function in immunity eds exists in multiple tnl protein complexes which promotes the connection between tnl and downstream signaling pathwaysrecent studies have shown that host molecules such as pathogen effector nlr protein and transcription factors are concentrated in the nucleus and the transport of disease resistance factors between cytoplasm and nucleus also greatly affects the innate immunity of plants for example barley mla arabidopsis rps and snc all need nuclear nlr accumulation to induce immune response potato nlr protein rx activates immune response through nucleus and cytoplasm and arabidopsis rpm activation and signal transduction occurs on the cell membrane and initiates signal transduction pathways in the cytoplasm activated nlr triggers a series of immune responses such as ros production ca spikes mapk cascades transcriptional reprogramming and plant hormone production current studies have shown that part of the nlr directly regulates the transcription process while the other part of the nlr remotely controls nuclear transcriptional reprogramming for example the wrky family transcription factors hvwrky and hvwrky have negative regulation on powdery mildew blumeria graminis fungal hvmyb has positive regulation on powdery mildew blumeria graminis fungal and hvwrky can inhibit the dna activity of hvmyb barley mla protein regulates transcriptional complex and induces gene expression and immune response by strengthening the binding of cc domain to hvmyb and releasing the inhibition of hvwrky on hvmyb however for nlrs which is not located in the nucleus how to transmit the signal to the nucleus is a key problem one possibility is that nlr recruits transcription factors at the location and the other is that nlr transmits eti signals to transcription factors just as arabidopsis thaliana cnls rps and rpm are located on the plasma membrane and both of them trigger mapks mitogenactivated protein kinase phosphorylation and then drive transcriptional reprogrammingprrs and nlrs mediate the two major plant immune systemspti and eti which play a role in different defense stages the first layer of immunity mediated by prrs has been widely studied but little is known about the interaction between the two immune pathways recently bruno pok man ngou et al  analyzed the relationship between the two immune systems by activating intracellular receptor nlrs without inducing surface receptor prrsmediated immunity and reshaped a new understanding of plant immunity in the established arabidopsis model the pathogen effector avrrps activated eti etiavrrps under the induction of estradiol etiavrrps could increase the production of ros triggered by flagellinderived polypeptide flg a bacterial pamp but etiavrrps alone could not activate the production of ros and the production of ros was the sign of defense response induced by prrs therefore etiavrrps can enhance pti but can not initiate pti at the same time cnl protein rps increased ros production induced by flg by recognizing eti mediated by pathogen effector avrrpt which proved that eti activated by nlr could also enhance pti by monitoring the accumulation of related proteins such as phosphorylated nadph oxidase rbohd and mapk protein mpk in the process of pti activation it was found that more related proteins were produced by coactivation of pti and etiavrrps than by activating pti alone correspondingly the pti deficient mutants bak bkk and fls efr were infiltrated into pst dc dcavrrps expressing avrrps it was found that the sensitivity of bak bkk to dcavrrps was the same as that of nlr mutant rps rpsb and avrrps could not be detected in rps rpsb and fls efr was more sensitive to dcavrrps than wildtype plants it is suggested that pti is essential for eti resistance which depends on nlr activation similarly the activation of prrs can also enhance the hr response therefore the pti and eti immune systems in plants enhance each other and work together to produce defense against pathogensour understanding of plant innate defense includes not only pathogen identification downstream signal transduction and transcriptional mechanisms of related genes but also more direct mechanisms leading to pathogen death such as the synthesis and action of lowmolecularweight secondary metabolites the function of secondary metabolites in plant against pathogens is one of the longeststudied plant immune responses similar to other conservative defense responses the synthesis and activation of secondary metabolites are triggered by pti or eti reactions and they are not directly involved in plant growth or reproduction but are often involved in plant defense and alkaloids is one of these compounds it is a defense compound in plants which has strong toxicity and can effectively resist pathogens studies have shown that alkaloids have a wide range of biological activities and can inhibit the infection or growth of plant pathogens such as fungi bacteria viruses and other plant pathogens so as to enhance plant disease resistance and have the potential to develop into a broadspectrum efficient environmentally friendly and safe new biological pesticide yan et al used conventional halfleaf method and leaf disk method combined with western blot analysis found that brucine b and brucine d in brucea javanica l merr had significant activity against tobacco mosaic virus tmv  matrine also has significant activity against tmv and its virus inhibitory activity is stronger than that of commercial virucide ribavirin when the concentration of matrine is  gml the in vitro inhibition rate of tmv can reach more than  tmv is the most widely distributed and most common disease in tobacco production with a general incidence of  seriously endangering the yield and quality of tobacco and causing huge economic losses to the tobacco industry therefore the research and application of alkaloids can reduce the damage caused by tmv infection to some extent and its development into broadspectrum botanical pesticides will alleviate the environmental pressure caused by chemical pesticidesat present fungi have greater impact on plants than viruses causing about  of plant diseases the species of fungi that infect plants are complex and infectious and several or even dozens of fungal diseases can be found on a crop fusarium graminearum has a destructive effect on the infection of wheat and  of the wheat will be lost when the maximum infection is reached alkaloids such as canthinone and lycorine were found to be effective against this fungal disease botrytis cinerea is in tomatoes strawberries and grapes tens of billions of dollars are spent on prevention and control every year which costs a lot of manpower and financial resources aniszewski et al found that naphthylisoquinoline in ancistrocladus wall and triphyophyllum peltatum hutch  dalziel airy shaw could significantly inhibit the spore growth of botrytis cinerea at present some studies have shown that many kinds of alkaloids play a role in plant protection in this paper the alkaloids against plant pathogens are summarized and listed in table alkaloids are mainly divided into four categories terpenoid indole alkaloids benzyl isoquinoline alkaloids scopolamine nicotine and purine alkaloids each kind of alkaloid has a specific biosynthetic pathway in plants most alkaloid molecules are synthesized from lamino acids such as tyrosine phenylalanine etc and various amino acids are either synthesized alone or combined with steroids and other terpenoid ligands amino acids can be transformed into highly specific precursors of alkaloid synthesis by tricarboxylic acid cycle reticuline is an important precursor of tetrahydrophenyl isoquinoline alkaloids morphine and dcorydaline can be further synthesized by specific enzyme catalysis the key bifurcation point of terpene indole alkaloid synthesis is strictosidine which can be further transformed into similar alkaloids such as vinblastine and quinine in addition nicotine and lhyoscyamine have similar synthetic pathways and their synthetic precursor is lornithine which is transformed by key enzymes such as putrescine nmethyltransferase tropinone reductase and scopolamine hydroxylase figure  shows an overview of plant alkaloid biosynthesisin the previous article we mentioned that berberine extracted from berberidaceae juss has a significant antifungal effect which can inhibit the growth of fiusaritum graminearum schw berberine belongs to benzylisoquinoline alkaloids bias which is a kind of alkaloids with important research value although the species of benzyl isoquinoline alkaloids are complex and diverse the initial steps of biosynthesis of bias are very similar most of them are tyrosine metabolites dopamine and hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde hpaa under the action of noraconitine synthase ncs snoraconitine is first formed by pictetspengler reaction followed by three methyltransferases omt cnmt omt and a cytochrome p oxidoreductase nmch form the key intermediate sreticuline which is a common upstream synthesis pathway  sscoulerine was formed by the action of berberine bridging enzyme bbe from sreticuline then berberine can be produced under the catalysis of methyltransferase somt p enzyme cas and flavindependent oxidase stox another branch after the formation of sscoulerine is a sixstep enzymatic reaction to form sanguinarine which can be obtained from chelidoniummajus l it can resist tobacco mosaic virusin addition part of the synthesis of plant defense alkaloids is induced by pathogens after the pathogen stimulates the plant the receptors on the plant cell membrane recognize this external signal and after combining with the pathogen the membrane composition changes resulting in changes in membrane permeability and ion distribution in the membrane leading to changes in intracellular gene activation and enzyme activity this process may require substances to act as intracellular messengers such as ca camp inositol phosphate salicylic acid and jasmonic acid finally the synthesis of defense alkaloids is regulated by regulating the key enzymes in the secondary metabolic pathwayat present some studies have supported the view that plant alkaloids are used as chemical defense weapons against pathogens plants accumulate a large amount of defensive alkaloids when they are infected by fungi with the accumulation of alkaloids the transcription or activity level of key enzymes in their synthesis is also improved  these alkaloids are neurotransmission or neuroreceptor blockers which can lead to dna alkylation so that transcription and replication can not be carried out normally resulting in frameshift phenomenon and leading to mutation when fusarium solani and aspergillum niger were added to the callus culture medium of catharanthus roseus l g don the accumulation of indole total alkaloids and vinblastine were positively regulated in different degrees and the effect of fusarium solani was significant it can induce the production of  times the amount of vinblastine on the contrary vinblastine can regulate the defense similarly the content of alkaloids in the tissue culture cells of rauvolfia verticillata lour baill increased significantly after being stimulated by fungithe discovery of diverse plant defense substances makes it possible to alleviate the pressure of plant pathogen infection while the significant development of modern biotechnology has created opportunities for the development of new plant varieties with genetic resistance tropane alkaloids tas are a kind of secondary metabolites synthesized in solanaceae juss by studying the related genes in the biosynthesis pathway of tas the content of tas in plants can be increased by secondary metabolism engineering pokeweed antiviral proteins pap are a kind of basic protein with enzyme function synthesized by different tissues or different growth stages of phytolacca it belongs to ribosome inactivating protein i rip and has certain inhibitory effect on plant virus at present there have been studies on the use of this characteristic the use of a variety of biotechnology to prepare plant defense substances dore et al cloned the open reading frame orf of pampap by pcr studied the translation process of inhibiting eukaryotes and found that its mutants can be used to construct immune viruses after that different types of paps were successfully cloned and expressed by genetic engineering technology through primer design and transformation the fusion protein was expressed in large quantities finally different pap genes were introduced into potato tobacco pepper tomato and other plants by transgenic technology and it was found that the transgenic plants had higher resistance to pathogens after the deletion of pampap gene transgenic wheat and tobacco obtained by chen had different degrees of resistance to wheat cyanosis and tobacco mosaiccamptothecin is a terpenoid indole alkaloid isolated from camptotheca acuminata endemic to china the use of modern biotechnology to regulate the biosynthesis of camptothecin and increase the yield of camptothecin is the focus of research liu et al used the young leaves with the highest content of camptothecin as explants to induce and culture callus through the screening of excellent cell lines the content of camptothecin in callus was increased in addition hairy root culture is a very effective method for the production of plant secondary metabolites agrobacterium tumefaciens is used to transform plants producing camptothecin and hairy root culture is established to produce camptothecin and its derivatives it is an effective way to alleviate the shortage of camptothecin raw materialsantimicrobial peptides amps are an important part of the innate immune system of almost all organisms amps resistance can help us overcome the loss of crop yield quality and safety caused by plant pathogens heterologous expression in plant systems also known as plant molecular agriculture can provide an economical and efficient mode of largescale productionthe natural environment is everchanging and full of challenges plants form a variety of adaptation or defense mechanisms in the process of longterm environmental interaction or survival competition and physiological and biochemical metabolism is an important aspect these characteristics produced by the struggle are gradually transformed into heritable properties which is the result of the evolution and development of plants adapting to the environment in recent years although great progress has been made in the study of plant disease resistance little is known about the mechanism of immune response mediated by disease resistance proteins and there are still many problems to be solved as one of the most important plant disease resistance proteins nlr protein has been concerned by researchers for a long time with the application of frozen electron microscope we can more directly observe the structure morphology and action initiation of nlr but the whole signal pathway is still not completely clear most nlr proteins are structurally conservative but can specifically recognize many effector proteins whether there are other special interaction modes between nlr proteins need to be discovered after the activation of nlr protein the specific defense mechanism downstream is also unknown so people still can not stop the exploration of nlr protein the discovery and research of disease resistance genes is of great significance for plant development and agricultural production transferring disease resistance genes into crops by biotechnology can cultivate excellent disease resistance varieties reduce the use of pesticides and effectively improve the ecological environmentplant secondary metabolites play an important role in protecting plants from pathogens the study on the synthetic pathway and regulation mechanism of plant secondary metabolites has important theoretical and practical significance for elucidating the relationship between plants and pathogens for the production of products beneficial to agricultural production and for the sustainable development of agriculture and the improvement of ecological environment due to the pharmacological efficacy of plant alkaloids and their

databases are distributed around the world data transfer among servers is crucial for distributed data mining however as the privacy of data is becoming protected legally and ethically it is necessary to abide by the laws and respect the ethical guidelines when transferring and utilizing the data as the information that affects the legalethical decision making is often distributed as well  the datatransfer plan has to be updated online as the new information is obtained while transferring data among servers in this paper we propose a dynamic htn planning method that makes a plan for multihop data transfers and data analysestransformations which considers legal and ethical norms in our knowledge representation we show that datatransfer tasks can be represented by the taskdecomposition rules of totalorder htn planning legal norms can be expressed as the preconditions of tasks and actions and ethical norms can be expressed as the costs of tasks and actions the planner dynamically modifies the plan  after obtaining new information  according to the laws and the ethical guidelines in the middle of the plan execution endabstract   sectionintroductionlabelsectionintroduction as the privacy of data is respected around the world many laws and ethical guidelines are established regarding the transfer and usage of the collected data some data are allowed to transfer only inside a country or a company some data are allowed to use only for specific purposes  since the laws and ethical guidelines of collected data are  complicated and different in each country there are some researches on the automated compliance check of norms in data transfers in citeagarwalpalmiranidevosbonattitaheri the policy presentation of  gdpr european general data protection regulation is studied towards automated compliance check  planning for data transfer under ethical norms is  a new subject of study in the studies of citetaherisatoh datatransfer planners and legalethical checkers are separate these are good frameworks considering that the logic of legalethical checkers is complicated which should be separate from the logic of planning however dynamic replanning is not realized in these studies  considering real international data transfers among distributed servers  dynamic replanning is crucial since the latest information necessary for planning is also distributed and not available when initially planning in other words the datatransfer plan has to be  dynamically checked and updated if necessary even in the middle of the plan execution  as new information is found at distributed servers  which might affect the validity of the plan  in this paper we present a new knowledge representation for dynamic htn planning  on transferring and utilizing distributed data considering legal and ethical norms we use an extended algorithm of dynagent citehayashi which is an it online totalorder htn planner totalorder htn planning algorithms citenauhayashibehnkemagnaguagnoschreiber are simple easy to use and used for representing the domain control heuristics by taskdecomposition rules  in our knowledge representation we show that datatransfer tasks can be represented  by the taskdecomposition rules of totalorder htn planning legal norms can be expressed as the preconditions of tasks and actions and ethical norms can be expressed as the costs of tasks and actions using this knowledge and online planning algorithm  the plan of data transfer and utilization is dynamically adapted to the new information obtained at local servers abiding by the laws and respecting the ethical guidelines   we assume that  the datatransfer planners and legalethical checkers are separate as in citetaherisatoh we focus not on  legalethical checking but on planning and replanning because we use an online planning algorithm the validity of the plan is checked and  the plan is updated in the middle of the plan execution with the help of the external legal and ethical checkers  the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section refsectionrelated related work is discussed in section refsectionplanning the algorithm of online htn planning is explained in section refsectionarchitecture  the system architecture of  the planning agent  with external legal and ethical checkers is presented in section refsectionproblem the problem of data transfer and utilization is defined in section refsectionconclusion the conclusion is summarized      sectionrelate worklabelsectionrelated htn planners  make plans by decomposing abstract tasks  into more concrete subtasks the earliest htn planners were created in late s  citesacedotitate other earlier htn planners were created around  citewilkinscurrie  the most popular and wellknown htn planner is shop citenau  which is a simple forwardchaining totalorder planner this forwardchaining planner decompose the subtasks  in the same order of execution domain control heuristics can be expressed  easily by the taskdecomposition rules called it methods nearly in the same way as  the horn clauses of the prolog programming language which are used for goalliteral decomposition  even now shop is standard in htn planning for example  but a translator from hddl to jshop citenau was provided note that shop is a partialorderplanner version of shop and that jshop is the java version of shop shoplike totalorder htn planners are  still studied to improve computational efficiency citebehnkemagnaguagnoschreiber  dynagent citehayashi is a simple shoplike totalorder forwardchaining htn planner unlike shop dynagent is an online htn planner when the current belief is updated  the dynagent planner modifies the plan even in the middle of plan execution dynagent was applied to real robot manipulation  such as online path planning citehayashi and online pickandplace planning arm manipulation citehayashihayashi we adopted and slightly modified  the online htn planning algorithm of dynagent in this study  this online planner never backtracks and cannot change the plan in the middle of plan execution however it delays the subtask decomposition till it becomes necessary and changes the way to decompose the subtasks according to the current situation it is interesting to note that this planner conducts  monte carlo tree search which is often used for game tree search this technique is known to be effective  when the search space is very large like chess or go also as in standard procedural programming languages this planner can represent complicated control processes such as ifthen and repetition   in the studies of citetaherisatoh the knowledge representation for datatransfer planning is expressed by logic programs that represent the simplified version citeshanahan of the event calculus citekowalski these planners are implemented by the asp answer set programming solver  which makes stable models by forward reasoning there is a textbook of asp citelifschitz however they are not online planners the idea of using the simplified version of the event calculus for planning was first introduced in citemiller a planner based on the eventcalculus was implemented in citeshanahan  using the prolog programming language event calculus is also used for representing causalities in computational ethics  in citeberrebyberreby     sectiononline htn planninglabelsectionplanning in this section we define the syntax and  the sketch of the algorithm  of online totalorder forwardchaining htn planning based on the algorithm of dynagent citehayashi dynagent citehayashi is similar to shop citenau however unlike shop dynagent is an online planner  subsectionsyntaxlabelsection syntax in this subsection we define the syntax of the it belief and it planning knowledge which are used by the planner because we implemented the algorithm in prolog the syntax follows its representation  in the following definition fluents predicates whose truth value can change  and clauses corresponding to horn clauses in prolog are defined as follows using bf constants bf variables bf functions and bf predicates as in prolog it constants it functions and it predicates are represented by  alphanumeric characters starting with a lowercase alphabet it variables are represented by  alphanumeric characters starting with an uppercase alphabet or  begindefinition a bf complex term is of the form sf fsf t cdots sf tn where n ge  sf f is an nary function and each sf ti  le i le n is a term a bf term is one of the following a constant a variable or a complex term a bf fluent is of the form sf psf t cdots sf tn where n ge  sf p is an nary predicate and each sf ti  le i le n is a term when sf p is a ary predicate the fluent sf p can be abbreviated to sf p a fluent is either bf derived or bf primitive enddefinition  in the following definition clauses are defined in the same way as prolog fluents are used to represent the states begindefinition a bf clause is of the form tt beliefsf f sf f cdots sf fn where n ge  sf f is a derived fluent called the bf head each sf fi  le i le n is a fluent and the set of fluents sf f cdots sf fn is called the bf body when n   the clause tt beliefsf f can be expressed as tt beliefsf f and sf f is called a bf fact the clause tt beliefsf f sf f cdots sf fn bf defines the fluent sf g if sf f is unifiable with sf g a fluent is either bf static or bf dynamic fluent sf f is regarded as dynamic iff it is declared as tt dysf f otherwise it is regarded as static enddefinition  now we define the syntax of tasks actions and totalorder plans as follows where it task symbols are represented by  alphanumeric characters starting with a lowercase alphabet begindefinition a bf task is of the form sf tsf x cdots sf xn where n ge  sf t is an nary task symbol and each sf xi  le i le n is a term when sf t is a ary task symbol the task sf t can be abbreviated to sf t a task is either bf abstract or bf primitive  an bf action is a primitive task the  bf cost sf c of the task sf t is represented as tt costsf tsf c  a bf plan is a list of tasks of the form  sf t cdots sf tn where n ge  and each sf ti  le i le n is a task which is called the ith element of the plan the bf cost of the plan sf t cdots sf tn is the sum of each cost of sf ti  le i le n enddefinition  in order to express the effect of an action we use the following action rules begindefinition an bf action rule is of the form actionsf a sf c sf e where sf a is an action  sf c is a list of fluents called bf preconditions  sf e is a list of bf effects an effect is either of the form tt initiatessf f or tt terminatessf f and sf f is a fluent enddefinition intuitively in the above definition tt initiatessf f  or tt terminatessf f represents that  the truth value of sf f becomes true respectively false after the action execution if all the preconditions hold  in order to express a method to decompose a task into subtasks we use the following taskdecomposition rules note that task decomposition rules are called it methods in shop citenau  begindefinition a bf taskdecomposition rule is of the form htnsf h sf c sf b where  sf h is an abstract task called the bf head  sf c is a list of fluents called bf preconditions and sf b is a plan called the bf body enddefinition   the bf planning agent has it belief and it planning knowledge which are used for planning  intuitively belief represents the current state while planning knowledge represents  the effects of actions and the methods to decompose tasks to subtasks  begindefinition bf belief is of the form langle sf d s rangle where sf d is a set of dynamic fluents and  sf s is a set of clauses  bf planning knowledge is of the form langle sf ar tdr cost rangle where sf ar is a set of action rules  sf tdr is a set of taskdecomposition rules and sf cost is a set of the cost of each task enddefinition   subsectionsketch of the algorithm in this subsection we show the sketch of  the algorithm we use in this study we use the algorithm of dynagent which is defined in detail in citehayashi however replanning method after cost updates is not shown we extend the algorithm so that it can handle cost updates  which is crucial for reflecting the ethical norms to the plan selection  subsubsectioninitial planning the planning agent has the belief and planning knowledge which are defined in the previous subsection belief represents the current state the truth value of each fluent of the world which the planning agent believes planning knowledge include action rules  taskdecomposition rules and cost information of tasks  beginfigureth  centering  includegraphicswidthlinewidthdecomposition  captiontask decomposition  labelfiguredecomposition endfigure  given the task the planning agent recursively decomposes the task till all the subtasks become primitive tasks  actions the htn planning algorithm is forwardchaining and the task decomposition is conducted in the same order of task execution as shown in figure reffiguredecomposition  as shown in figure reffiguremultiplesubplans when it taska in a plan is decomposed all the previous tasks before  it taska are primitive therefore it is easy to evaluate the truth value of  fluents in the state just before the task execution the preconditions it precond and it precond of the task decomposition  have to be satisfied just before the task execution which are added to the preconditions of the first subtask it taska  beginfigureth  centering  includegraphicswidthlinewidthmultiplesubplans  captionmultiple subplans  labelfiguremultiplesubplans endfigure  in general there are several ways to decompose a task for example in the case of the data transfer problem there are several routes of data transfer when decomposing a task in a plan  multiple plans are created using multiple taskdecomposition rules for example in figure reffiguremultiplesubplans the task it t in a plan is decomposed  to the three subplans it a a a a it b b  and it c therefore the search space of htn planning is an orsearchtree of plans  when each task has the cost information it is possible to conduct the best first search in the algorithm of dynagent to conduct the bestfirst search the planning agent keeps frontiers alternative plans in the orsearchtree of plans sorts the plans in the ascending order of cost  and decomposes the first abstract task in the plan with the lowest cost if the cost of a task is always lower than or equal to  the cost of its primitive subplans  subplans that have only actions the first found plan has the lowest cost   beginfigureb  centering  includegraphicswidthlinewidthprotectedlink  captionprotected link  labelfigureprotectedlink endfigure subsubsectionreplanning after belief deletion in the planning algorithm of dynagent each precondition a dynamic fluent of a task in a plan is recorded  in association with the task in the plan if its truth value is subject to change as shown in figure reffigureprotectedlink this fluent recorded as a precondition of a task serves as a it protected link which must be true just before the execution of the task   beginfigureh  centering  includegraphicswidthlinewidthreplan  captionswitching to an alternative plan  labelfigurereplan endfigure  after a belief update if the protected link in a plan is violated the plan becomes invalid then the invalid plan is removed from the frontiers of the orsearch tree as shown in figure reffigurereplan if the current plan become invalid the planning agent changes the current plan to the plan with the nextlowest cost and continues the bestfirst search using the frontiers of valid plans     subsubsectionreplanning after belief addition in the planning algorithm of dynagent when evaluating a precondition of a task in a plan if the precondition is the dynamic fluent the planning agent records the plan separately from the frontiers even when the fluent is false during the plan execution if the belief is updated and the precondition becomes true the recorded plan is asserted to the frontiers as a new valid plan because the plans in frontiers are always sorted if the new plan has the lowest cost the planning agent stops the current plan execution switches to the new plan and continues the bestfirst search which might lead to a better plan    subsubsectionreplanning after cost update in the planning algorithm of dynagent replanning after a cost update is not explicitly shown  however this is crucial in our planning with an ethical checker because the costs of unethical actions are dynamically set higher after the ethical check therefore we add a new replanning procedure to the algorithm  after the cost update of an action or a task we reevaluate the cost of each plan in the frontiers and sort the plans in the ascending of costs when the current plan become less attractive in terms of costs after the cost update  the planning agent stops the plan execution  changes the plan and continues the bestfirst search which might lead to a better plan     subsubsectionreplanning after action execution dynagent is an online planner and  updates each plan after each action execution it maintains all the alternative plans so that any plan can be started from the current state  beginfigureth  centering  includegraphicswidthlinewidthsuccess  captionplan update after action execution  labelfiguresuccess

an action succeeds the executed action is unifiable with the first action in the plan it is removed from each plan  sometimes an action execution in a plan invalidates other alternative plans therefore protected links are checked and invalid alternative plans are removed  even after a successful action execution   as shown in figure reffigurefailure when the execution of an action fails if the executed action is unifiable with the first action in the plan the plan is removed from the alternative plans recorded in the frontiers in this case the planning agent stops the plan execution and restarts the bestfirst search using the valid plans in the frontiers till it finds the plan       beginfigureh  centering  includegraphicswidthlinewidtharchitecture  captionsystem architecture  labelfigurearchitecture endfigure  in figure reffigurearchitecture  we show the overall system architecture of our online htn planning agent with external legal and ethical checkers  in this paper we focus on  the knowledge representation of the belief and the planning knowledge which the online htn planner uses for planning and replanning  the online planning agent also has  the event handler that inputs  a task or a beliefcost update request  to the online htn planner when receiving an event from the external world observer that obtains new information note that the user interface that receives a command from the user can be regarded as a world observer an example of the event handler is  explained in citehayashi  the online planning agent also has  the action executor that receives a command of action execution from the online htn planner and controls the external controller to execute the action   in order to utilize external legal and ethical checkers we need the norm check requester that inputs the next action to the legal and ethical checkers because we need to  check the legal and ethical norms before executing an action the action executor sends the next action to this norm check requester  if the next action is not changed  after checking the legal and ethical norms the action executor executes the action as usual if there is a legal or ethical problem the belief update requester or  the cost update requester sends the belief update request  or the cost update request  to the online htn planner which triggers replanning  in this study we only designed and implemented the knowledge belief and planning knowledge  and the algorithm of the online planning agent in future we would like to connect the planning agent to the legal and ethical checkers

two datatransfer routes  from scriptsize tt node to scriptsize tt node the planner selects the route with the least cost by the bestfirst search note that the datatransfer cost from scriptsize tt node

abandon the plan to transfer the analysis output via scriptsize tt companyb it is kept as an alternative plan and will be used when there is no other choice  subsectionexperiment on computation time we implemented the planning agent the belief and the planning knowledge in swi prolog windows bit version  which was installed on the windows  home pc with intelr coretm ig cpu and the gb of ram  we measured the cpu times five times each for  initial planning dynamic replanning after legal check  and dynamic replanning after ethical check the average cpu times were    and  seconds respectively  therefore for the test case scenario in this study this planner is adequate for practical use        sectiondiscussionlabelsectiondiscussion from the case study we can understand that the legal norm of an action can be expressed as the precondition of the action this means that the illegal action cannot be executed because its legal norm is not satisfied  on the other hand the ethical norm of an action  can be expressed as the costs of the actions the higher the cost is the more unethical the action is even if an action is unethical it is still legal to execute the action if the planner can find the lowercost plan the agent can avoid unethical action execution if possible however unethical actions can still be executed if there is no other choice even in that case  it is possible to stop the action execution when its cost is too high  which means that the action is too unethical  ethical norms of actions can be expressed as the soft constraints of the precondition which should be satisfied if possible  but do not have to be satisfied however many planners do not support soft constraints therefore it is easier to express ethical norms of actions as the costs of the actions  it is not always possible to collect all necessary information at the time of initial planning  especially when latest information is distributed in multiple servers in the case study scenario in this paper the planning agent obtains new information regarding the next action just before its execution legal and ethical norms are checked at this time therefore it is important to dynamically check and update the plan while executing it this is why an tt online planning algorithm is used in this paper    sectionconclusionlabelsectionconclusion we have shown how to represent knowledge about legal and ethical norms  using an online totalorder forwardchaining htn planning algorithm in the domain of data transfer and utilization in multiagent systems precondition of an action was used for its legal check but the cost of an action was used for its ethical check dynamic adaptation to legalethical norms was realized by the combination of dynamic replanning and  external checkers of legalethical norms  these techniques are extremely important when latest information which might affect legalethical norms  is distributed in multiple servers from the expeiment we confirmed that this planner is adequate for practical use in terms of computation time   we have also designed the system architecture that combines the online planning agent and external legal and ethical checkers in future we would like to implement the overall system we also would like to design a explainable dynamic planner that can explain the reason for plan modification to the users in terms of legal and ethical norms

Research paper_Journal article,RYNOG_5_5.docx,Research paper_Journal article,RYNOG_5_5.docx,high organizationbased selfesteem is associated with lower risk of depressive symptoms among university athletesryusei noguri  yujiro kawata  shinji yamaguchi  nobuto shibata  tsuneyoshi ota as depressive symptoms can impair athletes healthy competitive life and lead to a decline in performance it is necessary to identify and prevent these symptoms organizationbased selfesteem is one of the factors that influence the mental health of the members of an organization it has been found that employees with high organizationbased selfesteem have good mental health however the relationship between organizationbased selfesteem and mental health has not yet been investigated in athletes therefore we aimed to develop an organizationbased selfesteem scale for university athletes study i and investigate the relationship beween organizationbased selfesteem and depressive symptoms study ii study i included subsample a  university athletes average age    years and subsample b  university athletes average age    who responded to the newly developed organizationbased selfesteem scale for university athletes obseua the rosenberg selfesteem scale and the sports commitment scale to confirm the reliability of the developed scale two weeks later they responded to the obseua again in study ii the participants were  university athletes average age    years who completed the obseua developed in study i and the selfrating depression scale in study i we extracted a onefactor structure with six items for the obseua using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis sufficient validity and reliability were confirmed by examining the relationship between organizationbased selfesteem and sports commitment scale and retest methods respectively in study ii athletes with high organizationbased selfesteem showed a  time lower risk of experiencing depressive symptoms compared to athletes with low organizationbased selfesteem recently prevalence of anxeitydepressive symptoms among athletes had been reported  gouttebarge et al  to experience depressive symptoms may cause lower performance newman et al  lochbaum et al  and injury yang et al  additionally mental health issue also causes competitive drop out among athletes isoardgautheur et al according to a recent review related factors to mental health such as depresive symptoms were clasified into following four categories personal risk factors personal protective factors sportenvironmental risk factors and sportenvironmental protective factors kuettel and larsen  for instance injury and overtraining are personal risk factors basic need and  carrier satisfaction are personal protective factors while trusting and masteryoriented climate are sportsenvironmental protective factors sportspetific stressors and lack of support from teammates and conaches are sportsenvironmental risk factors selfcompetence in organization may be one of the  related factors to experience depressive symptoms among athletes bullying and mistreatment within a sport organisation had been reported as the trigger for depressive symptoms lebrun et al  mental health is impaired when athletes are unable to find their role within the organization to which they belong ojio et al  in contrast as the protective factors fo depresive symptoms about own performance perceive acceptance from coach had been reported doherty et al  thus athletes who cannot feel own competence in the team are likely to appear depressive symptoms the relationship between an individual and their organization is called organizationbased selfesteem organizationbased selfesteem is defined as the degree to which an individual believes him or herself to be capable significant and worthy as an organizational member pierce et al  organizationbased selfesteem had been accumulated in the field of occupational health organizationbased selfesteem has been reported to be associated with depressive symptoms wellbeing supervisers leadership and support ferris et al  bowling et al  matsuda et al  zhang and liu  a survey of corporate employees found that people with low selfesteem had more depressive symptoms than those with high selfesteem bowling et al  thus research on selfesteem within an organization has been actively conducted mainly in the field of occupational health for corporate employeesfor the purpose to measure organizasionbased selfesteem among corporate employees selfreported measurement was developed pierce et al  developed the item organizationbased selfesteem scale obse which has been widely used in research on organizationbased selfesteem matsuda et al  then developed the japanese version organizationbased selfesteem scale obsej targeted japanese employees obse consists of items such as i am needed at work and i have trust in me at work however because the expression of the items are not suitable for measuring the condition of the athlete in the organization obse cannot be suitably used to measure athletes selfesteem within an organization to the best of our knowledge no study has developed a scale to measure organizationbased selfesteem among athletesuniversity athletes like the employees of a company are exposed to evaluation within the team and at some point the significance of their existence in the team becomes unstable while some athletes are assigned roles such as captains and managers some belong to the team but cannot act as regular or onearmed forces and therefore might lack selfesteem thus there are differences in the level of athletes selfesteem within the organization even in the same team selfesteem within the organization plays an important role in the field of sports science just as in the field of occupational health organizationbased selfesteem may vary depending on the method of coaching and instruction such as role assignment and rights transfer within the organization in addition if university athletes organizationbased selfesteem can be measured the actual state of their selfesteem which has not been clarified so far can be grasped in detail this can also help advance research on organizationbased selfesteem and provide a way for university athletes to lead a healthy competitive lifeaccroding previous studyduies kuettel and larsen  organizationbased selfesteem can be one of the personal proactive factors to mental health as the may maintaining healthy mental health may relate thus now we hypothesized as follows hypothesis athletes with high organizationbased selfesteem were difficult to produce depressive symptomsthis study is considered necessary for the following reasons there few research which investigated the relationship between organizationbased selfesteem and depressive symptoms among athletes self competence in team the protective factor to depressive symptoms among athletes has been still limitted to the case study doherty et al  to cralify ways to treat depressive symptoms it is necessary to suggest fealdoperable protective factors thus to clarify the relationship organizationbased selfesteem among athlete and depressive symptoms may contribute development of personal approach method and coaching methodthe purpose of this study was to develop a university athletes version of the obse and verify its validity and reliability study i and to examine the relationship between organizationbased selfesteem and risk ofon depressive symptoms among university athletes study iiin study i to examine validity and reliability of organizationbased selfesteem for university athlete contained two subsamples a and b we used sub sample a consisted of  university athletes  male  female mage    years mean competitive years    years who belonged to the competitionoriented sports club of the university when we analyzed an exploratory factor analysis in addition we used sub sample b consisted of  university athletes  male  female mage    years mean competitive years    years who belonged to the competitionoriented sports club of the university when we analyzed a confirmatory factor analysis futhermore  participants randomly selected from sub sample a  male  female mage    years mean competitive years    years were included in the resurvey at an interval of  weeks assessing sociodemographic information and organizationbased selfesteem scale for university athletesstudy i was conducted with the approval of the research ethics committee of the faculty of health and sports science juntendo university approval number  the purpose of the study and the anonymity of the data were explained to the participants they were also informed of their right to decline to participate at any time without any reason even after consenting to participate all participants provided written informed consent only those who agreed to the study participated in the study participants were recruited after college classes answers were collected by online survey methods participants responded in a quiet environment sociodemographic information name sex age competitive events competitive years role in the team competition resultsto develop the scale we revised the original items in the obse pierce et al  and the japanese version of the organizationbased selfesteem scale obsej matsuda et al  for instance items in obse pierce et al  included the word around here eg i am trusted around here however we replaced items in this scale with the word team to target athletes eg i can make a difference in my team see table to maintain the content validity each item was selected by the consensus of a university faculty member specializing in sports psychology a faculty member specializing in health psychology a faculty member specializing in mental health as a psychiatrist and a graduate student specializing in sports psychology who had more than  years of active sports experience for each item measurements were taken using a point likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree the mean score of all items was the total scale score the higher the score the higher the selfesteem within the organization moreover obse pierce et al  and obsej matsuda et al  are a onefactorstructured measureto measure the criterionrelated validity of the organizationbased selfesteem scale for university athletes obseua we used the japanese version of the rosenberg selfesteem scale rsesj mimura and griffiths  referring to previous studies matsuda et al  pierce et al  the rsesj was translated from the original rosenberg selfesteem scale rosenberg  into japanese and its validity and reliability have been confirmed mimura and griffiths  the rsesj has two factors a positive attitude  items and a negative attitude  items the items are rated on a point likert strongly disagree disagree agree and strongly agree the average score of each factor was calculated higher scores indicated higher selfesteemto measure the criterionrelated validity of the obseua we used the japanese version of the sports commitment scale scsj hagiwara and isogai  referring to previous studies matsuda et al  pierce et al  the scsj was translated from the original sports commitment scale scanlan et al  into japanese and its validity and reliability have been confirmed hagiwara and isogai  the scsj consists of  items measured on point likert scales from not at all dedicated to very dedicated and not at all hard to very hard the total scale score was calculated higher scores indicated a higher level of sports commitmentthe mean and standard deviation of each item were calculated and the ceiling and floor effects and measurement accuracy were checked for each item in the obseua to examine the discriminating power of each item in the obseua the participants were classified into the top  and bottom  of the scale scores for the

studies on the obse pierce et al  and obsej matsuda et al to investigate the internal consistency of the scale cronbachs alpha coefficients and omega coefficients were calculatedto examine the reproducibility of the scale we measured the obseua at week intervals then we calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient icc  using the time measurement data of the obseua as measured at week intervals next the blandaltman analysis was performed to examine the degree of agreement between the two obseua measurements in the blandaltman analysis the  confidence interval of the difference between the two measurement scores was calculated and if the  confidence interval did not cross  it was judged that there was a fixed bias when the correlation coefficient of the score difference between the two measurements and the average value of the two measurements was significantly associated a proportional error was judgedthe software ibm spss statistics version  ibm corp armonk ny usa amos  ibm corp armonk ny usa and microsoft excel  microsoft seatlle wa usa were used for these analyses the significance level for this study was less than no ceiling or floor effects were observed in any of the items therefore all  items were used in subsequent analysesas it was assumed that there is a correlation between the total obseua score and each item of the obseua pearsons productmoment correlation was used for the it analysis a positive correlation with the total score was confirmed at the  level for all  items r   p  in addition participants with a high total score on the obseua were shown to have a high score for each item therefore based on the median obseua score the participants were classified into the obseua high group and obseua low group and the item scores were compared using ttests significant differences were confirmed at the  level for all  itemsbefore performing factor analysis for the obseua we examined the sample validity to examine whether the sample size was sufficient as a result kmo was above  and bs value was significant confirming that the data were suitable for factor analysis kmo   bs   p  to clarify the factor structure of the obseua we performed an exploratory factor analysis on the  items that were included in the original draft of the obseua the items were selected based on a load of  or more for all factors as a result  items per

satisfied the significance level however the model goodnessoffit indicators were   df   p   gfi   agfi   cfi   and rmsea   which were not statistically sufficient therefore we checked the revised index where values of  or more were shown in items    and  based on this it was concluded that these four items were redundant therefore these items were excluded and confirmatory factor analysis was performed again as a result a statistically sufficient model goodness of fit was obtained   df   p   gfi   agfi   cfi   tli   rmsea   srmr   therefore the final version of the obseua consisted of  items for the one factor figure to verify the criterion validity we examined the relationship between the total score of the obseua and external criteria the results showed that positive attitude r   p   and negative attitude on the rsesj r   p   and total score on the scsj r   p   had a significant correlation with the obseuato examine the internal consistency of the obseua we performed a reliability analysis using cronbachs alpha and omega coefficient the results showed a high internal consistency       across the scaleto clarify the reproducibility of the obseua we calculated the interclass correlation coefficient of the two measurements and found high reliability icc   p   next as a result of confirming the addition error and the proportionality error by the blandaltman analysis neither fixed error  confidence interval  nor proportionality error was observed r   p  study ii was conducted between june to september  participants were  athletes average age    years average competition history    years who belonged to the competitionoriented sports club of the universitystudy ii was conducted with the approval of the research ethics committee of the faculty of health and sports science juntendo university approval number  the purpose of the study and the anonymity of the data were explained to the participants they were also informed of their right to decline to participate at any time without any reason even after consenting to participate all participants provided written informed consent only those who agreed to the study participated in the study participants were recruited after college classes answers were collected by online survey methods participants responded in a quiet environment the obseua was used to measure organizationbased selfesteem in athletes this scale revealed a onefactor structure with  items and showed good reliability and validity in study i each item was rated on a point likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree a higher score indicated higher organizationbased selfesteemthe selfrating depression scale sds zung  was used to identify depressive symptoms in athletes this is a reliable and valid tool consisting of  items the sds items are scored on a scale from  not occasionally to  almost always the total score was calculated with higher scores indicating more severe depressive symptoms in this study with reference to zung   points were classified as mild depressive symptoms  points as moderate and  points or more as severeto examine the confounding factors for depressive symptoms we examined the relationship between individual attributes and depressive symptoms gender role in the team ttest for binary variables in the sport age and grade and sports history were analyzed by onefactor analysis of variance students ttest was performed for binary variables such as gender role in the team and onefactor analysis of variance was performed for multivalued variables such as age grade and competition historybinomial logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between organizationbased selfesteem and depressive symptoms in university athletes the independent variable was based on the median obseua score low group less than  points high group  points or more and the dependent variable was based on the cutoff value of sds low group less than  points high group  points or morethe sds comprehensively captures  types of depressive symptoms therefore to examine which depressive symptoms are associated with organizationbased selfesteem a binomial logistic regression analysis was also performed using the two groups based on the median obseua score and the midpoint of each symptom on the sds if the participant responded with  no occasionally or  occasionally to each item they were included in the low group whereas if they responded with  for a long time or  almost always they were classified as the high group ibm spss statistics version  ibm corp armonk ny usa was used for all statistical analysesthe results are shown in table  the analysis of confounding factors revealed a significant association of depressive symptoms with gender and role in the team however no association was found for age grade competition years or eventsto examine the relationship betweenorganizationbased selfesteem and depressive symptoms in university athletes a binomial logistic regression analysis was performed using the obseua score as the independent variable depressive symptoms as dependent variables and gender and role in the team as confounders the results showed that the prediction accuracy of this model was guaranteed from the tests of hosmer and lemeshow    df   p   a significant relationship or  ci    p   was also shown suggesting that athletes with high organizationbased selfesteem were approximately  times less likely to develop moderate or higher depressive symptoms than athletes with low organizationbased selfesteem figure  binomial logistic regression analysis showed significant relationships for the following depressive symptoms appetite confusion decreased psychomotricity indecision selfunderestimation emptiness and dissatisfaction table in this study to clarify the relasionship betweenorganizationbased selfesteem and depression symptoms among university athletes we first developed an organizationbased selfesteem scale for university athletes obseua in study i results of the exploratory factor analysis for the obseua showed a onefactor structure similar to that in previous studies dealing with other organizationbased selfesteem scales matsuda et al  pierce et al  we performed a confirmatory factor analysis to verify the modification indices we deleted  items from the original  items because they were redundant and checked the goodness of the model fit again the results showed that cfi gfi agfi tli were  or more and rmsea and srmr were less than  compared with the criteria of model goodness of fit we considered that a generally good model was shown browne and cudeck  hu and bentler in a previous study on corporate employees pierce et al   items were used to assess organizationbased selfesteem whereas in this study on university athletes there were  items the  items that we deleted were i am trusted in my team there is faith in me in my team i am a valuable member of this team and i am an important member of this team items refrects the status in the organization i am trusted in my team there is faith in me in my team and items refrects the evaluation in the organization i am a valuable member of this team i am an important member of this team were excluded whereas the extracted items included in the final version of the obseua imply competence demonstrated in the organization cfi can make a difference in my team i am efficient in my team therefore it may be concluded that for university athletes competence demonstrated in the organization is a major element of selfesteem within the organization this may be due to the competitive environment that athletes live in for example university athletes who play individual sports may believe that they can contribute to the team by performing better on their own than by finding value in the evaluation of others in study i  participants were involved in individual sports while  were in team sports thus it is possible that items including status and evaluations by others were omitted due to differences in the athletes competition environmentfurthermore statistically sufficient results were obtained to confirm the reliability of the obseua as in previous studies on organizationbased selfesteem scales matsuda et al  pierce et al  in this study the reproducibility was examined for two weeks and it was suggested that the item average of the obseua was within the fluctuation of about  points the  ci of limit of agreement in fluctuation was   lower    points from this value if over  ci of limit of agreement in fluctuation   of this scale by some intervention is found it can be regarded as the intervention effect the internal consistency was  which corresponds to the criterion of almost perfect landis and koch  from these results it can be concluded that the organizationbased selfesteem scale was created to measure the selfesteem of university athletes belonging to various sports teamsthis study investigated the relationship between organizationbased selfesteem and risk of depressive symptoms in university athletes using the newly developed obseua the results showed that athletes with high organizationbased selfesteem were approximately  time less likely to develop moderate or severe depressive symptoms than athletes with low organizationbased selfesteem in other words athletes who feel they have a significant presence and role in their team are less likely to develop severe depressive symptomsthis study is novel in that it clarified for the first time the relationship between university athletes organizationbased selfesteem and depressive symptoms and confirmed the effect by odds ratios when targeting employees and workers it has been reported that those with high selfesteem within the organization are less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms bowling et al  jex and elacqua  matsuda et al  additionally these findings validated the hypothesis about the association between organizationbased selfesteem among athletes and depressive symptoms in this study and the notion made by kuettel and larsen  what athlete feel own competence in the team is on of the protective factors of depressive symptoms hence increasing organizationbased selfesteem among athlete may be related with improving depressive symptoms nevertheless as these studies used linear regression analyses the relevance of their results was clarified but not the risks so to sugest the coaching aimed to improve and prevent depressive symptoms among athletes future surveies should consider the causal effect relationship of organizationbased selfesteem and depressive symptoms among athletes using the longitudinal study in study ii we examined the relationship betweenorganizationbased selfesteem and risk of depressive symptoms measured by the sds results showed that athletes with high organizationbased selfesteem have a lower risk of experiencing decreased appetite confusion psychomotor retardation indecisiveness personal devaluation emptiness and dissatisfaction than athletes with low organizationbased selfesteem these symptoms correspond mainly to cognitive symptoms of depression kitamura hirano chen and hirata  conducted a factor analysis on each symptom in the sds in university athletes and found that the sds contains three factors emotional cognitive and physical in this study indecision selfunderestimation and emptiness which were shown to be related to selfesteem within the organization were included among the cognitive factors this suggests that organizationbased selfesteem in university athletes may reduce the risk of developing symptoms related to the cognitive aspect of depression whereas there was almost no association between the emotional and physical symptoms of depression and organizationbased selfesteem therefore organizationbased selfesteem may not be involved in the emotional and physical symptoms of depression as organizationbased selfesteem seems to be associated with the cognitive aspects of depression it may be possible to mitigate relatively minor depressive symptoms by promoting high organizationbased selfesteem however it may be difficult to mitigate depressive symptoms at a pathological level of the emotional and physical aspects as it is expected that the cognitive aspects of depressive symptoms are also significantly involved in the performance of athletes it is important for athletes to successfully develop selfesteem within the organization to enhance performancebased on the above it is necessary to examine factors that enhance their selfesteem for athlete within the organization for a healthy competitive life studies on corporate employees have shown that organizational support is involved in maintaining organizationbased selfesteem specifically employees who felt that they enjoyed support from the organization were shown to have high selfesteem within the organization ferris et al  matsuda et al  moreover employees who rated the leaders of their organization as humble also had high selfesteem within the organization zhang and liu  therefore assuming a sports instruction scene social support from teammates and supportive leadership behavior by instructors may be crucial factors to promote organizationbased selfesteem among athletes these conclusions need to be verified in future research using the scale developed in this studyfinally the limitations of the study and future issues are described first the outcome of this study was limited to depressive symptoms however athletes face diverse mental health problems and depressive symptoms are only one of the responses to stress observed in athletes therefore it is necessary to examine the relationship between organizationbased selfesteem and mental health problems apart from depressive symptoms second organizationbased selfesteem may be involved in cognitive stressors high selfesteem within the organization was not found to be associated with job stressors ambiguity conflicts and overload in roles but this association was observed in those with low selfesteem within the organization pierce et al  job stressors may reduce job satisfaction pierce et al  therefore in the future it is necessary to examine the relationship between selfesteem within the organization and stress in athletes third the current study had a crosssectional research design to clarify the causal relationship between organizationbased selfesteem and depressive symptoms it is necessary to design a longitudinal study to examine how organizationbased selfesteem is involved in the development of depressive symptomsthis study developed a scale with sufficient reliability and validity to assess organizationbased selfesteem in university athletes athletes with high organizationbased selfesteem were  time less likely to develop depressive symptoms than athletes with low organizationbased selfesteem thus facilitating athletes acquisition of organizationbased selfesteem may be a important role in preventing depressive symptoms among university athletes in addition organizationbased selfesteem in university athletes can be measured using the obseua developed in this study the development of this scale will promote research activities regarding organizationbased selfesteem in university athletesrn designed this study collected all the data performed the statistical analysis and prepared the manuscript yk supported all processes of the study study design data

Others,SHASE_12.docx,Other,SHASE_12.docx,the bottom of the pyramid bop refers to those people on the planet who are regarded as the poorest in the socioeconomic strata and the business activities of companies in particular multinational corporations mncs targeting such people are called bop businesses the term bop was first introduced by prahalad and hart   since the poor people are placed at the bottom of the pyramid structure of socioeconomic stratification by income later the term bottom was considered to carry discriminatory overtones and base was used more frequently instead although the term bop itself has not changed more recently the united nations un and other international organizations tend to prefer the term inclusive business in place of bop arguing that using the term base or bottom to distinguish themselves from others is not the way to solve social problemsspecifically the bop is defined as a population group with annual per capita consumption expenditure or income of less than  at purchasing power parity ppp in  hammond et al  as figure  shows there are  billion people at the bop representing  of the  billion people recorded by available national household surveys worldwide with an overall market size estimated to reach  trillion at the middle of the pyramid mop are  billion people with incomes between  and   of the worlds population at the top of the pyramid top are the mature markets mainly in the developed countries with annual per capita incomes of over  and a population of  billion or only  of the worlds population the area of each segment in the figure is shown according to its actual share which makes it easier to understand how the bop group accounts for a large part of the total while the top is a very small partthe distribution of the population when arranged in order of actual income level is as shown in the bar chart in figure  and it does not have a neat shape like a pyramid drawn with triangles the upper part of the distribution is narrow due to the very small number of highincome earners and the lowest part is wide due to the very large number of poor people with the population increasing at a nonproportional rate as it approaches the bottom the vertical axis could originally be set much higher to astronomical heights but for the sake of the drawing it is limited to  a day and no highercorporate bop business is typically regarded as the business activity of a company that simultaneously satisfies the following three conditionspeople belonging to the bop segment play one or more of the following roles consumer supplier worker producer seller or managerthe business activity improves one or more of the social or environmental challenges faced by the bopthe business activity is carried out by a private company or its subsidiaries with a view to increasing profitsin other words corporate bop business represents a form of creative capitalism kinsley and clarke  where business is conducted with the dual intention of pursuing economic outcomes by opening up new highgrowth markets and social outcomes by solving critical social problems in those marketsthe most commonly used quantitative definition of bop mentioned earlier is an annual income of less than  so if we divide this by  and simply convert it to a daily income we get less than  therefore in figure  the bottom nine bars ie the area below the red dotted line correspond to the bop this shows that in  the bop group accounted for  of the worlds population yellow bars compared to  in  blue bars and that the volume zone has moved up slightly from the bottom in particular the number of people living in extreme poverty  those earning less than  per day world bank  or the bottom two bars  has fallen dramatically in the three decades since  part of this upward shift in the volume zone may be seen as having been brought about by bop business although a large proportion of the population still belongs to the bop segmentduring the postwar period to the s when the northsouth problem was raised there was criticism that the expansion of mncs from developed to developing countries would lead to the exploitation of the poor this is the argument of the known new imperialismin the s when it became widely recognized that foreign direct investment fdi could contribute to the economic development of developing countries many of these countries turned their stance towards accepting fdi and some emerging countries became even more welcoming in the s yet on the part of the multinationals they continued to operate with an imperialist mindset which saw developing countries as places to sell their old products or to squeeze profits out of their sunset technologies prahalad  lieberthal  during this period various social challenges faced by lowincome groups including poverty have been addressed through grant aid preferential loans technical assistance provision of relief supplies donations or volunteer activities by public bodies such as governments of developed countries un agencies the world bank the asian development bank adb and the african development bank afdb as well as other nongovernmental organizations ngo  in the s after years of official development assistance oda failing to produce the desired results in poverty alleviation while breeding graft and corruption developed countries experienced aid fatigue and key members of the oecd development assistance committee dac began to reduce their oda spending at the same time the concept of private finance initiatives pfi took root as western countries sought to move towards smaller governments raising the expectation that public services could be financed more by the private sector this trend was also reflected in development aid to developing countries where the importance of publicprivate partnerships p has been emphasized moreover as the development needs of developing countries diversify from dealing with debt crises and structural economic reforms to broader social issues such as poverty hunger health environment education or human rights it is increasingly recognized that the administrative approach of governments and international organizations is limited rather it has come to the view that development projects can be carried out more efficiently using private finance and technology particularly from mncssince the late s there has been a growing momentum for corporate social responsibility csr which considers that companies have a responsibility to return profits from their business to have a positive or not to have negative impact on the environment and all stakeholders including consumers employees investors and local communities csr used to be regarded as selfregulatory and voluntary decisions at individual firm level although its interpretation and evaluation varied between countries and regions however it has moved to mandatory schemes at national regional and international levels as national governments and international organizations pushed companies to develop sustainable practices laws and regulations were introduced and stakeholders increasingly demanded it these include the iso  series of environmental management standards issued in  as a response to the earth summit  the widespread adoption of the concept of triple bottom line tbl  social people environmental planet and economic profit bottom lines  in accounting and auditing procedures and the global reporting initiative gri a ngo launched in  to develop international standards guidelines for sustainability reporting by companies and other organizationsthe un global compact ungc a nonbinding charter announced by the then un secretarygeneral at the world economic forum in  and launched in july  with the signature by  companies from  countries required companies to act in a socially environmentally and ethically responsible manner signatories were requested to integrate the ten principles in the four areas  human rights labour environment and anticorruption  set out in the ungc into their commercial activities private companies recognized as an essential force in achieving the development goals set by the un for developing countries were expected to act as a catalyst through their actions in support of these goals in september  with the enactment of the un millennium development goals mdgs eight international goals were set with numerical targets to be achieved by  in order to solve the problems of developing countries one of the targets was to reduce by half the number of people suffering from extreme poverty and hunger compared to  in order to achieve these very challenging development goals on time the traditional approach of relying on oda from developed countries or support and donations from international organizations and ngos was completely insufficient and expectations of the role that business activities could play had become increasingly important in response mncs and entrepreneurs have sought to further address poverty reduction from a business perspective by providing products and services that meet the needs of developing countries this led to the emergence of the bop businessthe bop businesses that emerged in the early years were essentially attempts by mncs to modify existing goods and services and offer them at lower prices so that people at the bop markets could afford them poverty was defined there as the deprivation of basic needs such as food and water clothing shelter sanitation and health and electricity and because of this poverty people were regarded to suffer from various disadvantages known as the bop penalty prahalad   higher costs of living due to poverty such as transport utilities food medicine etc the role of bop business was thus thought to be to eliminate the bop penalty and to meet their basic needs to this end modification of existing business models such as the small packaging strategy were suggested to eliminate the bop penalty if it could achieve the as  affordability access and availability prahalad  this will create a fair market for the poor improve the standard of living of the bop and raise their incomes they will then move to the next volume zone hammond et al  opening up new market opportunities for mncs that is why the bop business can be a sustainable for companies as the base part of the pyramid shifts upwards it may no longer be a pyramid structure but a diamondshaped structure with a thicker midlayer this approach to the bop market which seeks to reduce poverty through consumption was later labelled bop  by simanis et al mncs from developed countries have not had much experience of doing business in developing countries apart from their former resource development and procurement activities nor were they at all accustomed to doing business in the poor world where markets  a network in which buyers and sellers interact to exchange goods and services for money  are largely nonexistent or poorly functioning compared to developed countries with wellfunctioning market mechanisms therefore they have often chosen to work with ngos and entrepreneurs acting on the ground they believed that without partnerships with this third sector  the civil sector which is neither public nor private  the approach to bop segment where simple aid is ineffective and markets do not function well would not be possibleidentify the bop segment as potential customers and listen to them deeply to understand their specific needs and wantsdevelop promising solutions for the bop through means such as lowering prices narrowing down features redesigning packaging exploring new distribution channels to meet previously unreachable customers needs  one of the wellknown examples of bop  is among others the purified water business of procter  gamble pg as a bop initiative pg launched the childrens safe drinking water csdw program in  it is to provide safe drinking water to children aged  years in developing countries pg worked with the us centers for disease control and prevention uscdc to invent a water purification powder and provide sachets of purifier of water pur to children in rural villages and refugee camps it was decided to use sachets because the poor could not afford to pay a lot of money at once with just  grams of powder and a bucket spoon and cloth the dirty water can be turned into clean drinkable water in  minutes pg did not just sell the product through its usual distribution network but worked with around  organizations including international ones such as the red cross and unicef un international childrens emergency fund as well as local ngos   another example is unilevers soap business in india in  hindustan lever limited hll then unilevers subsidiary in india launched a year health and hygiene education campaign swasthya chetna health awakening to promote unilevers  lifebuoy brand of its hygiene products the program was launched in eight states of india with objective being to educate around  million people in rural and urban areas on the importance of health and hygiene fernando  purkayastha  through demonstrations interactive visuals and drama workshop mainly in primary schools hll educated children about the effectiveness of washing hands with soap to prevent diseases the children would go home and tell their parents about it who would in turn tell their neighbors relatives and work colleagues through this word of mouth the sanitation concept took root in indian society through this social marketing unilever aimed to cause behavioral change in two ways attracting those consumers who never used soap and convincing people to use soap more frequently thus creating more users for its brand as a result unilever succeeded in expanding a market for the companys lifebuoy products that had been introduced in india long ago but had only been recognized by a small group of wealthy people while solving a social problem in india where many people were suffering from poor health due to lack of hygiene habitsdespite many attempts other than those mentioned above by pg and unilever bop  has not been as successful as expected many of them have failed to scale generate satisfactory returns or adequately address the development challenges of the poor pgs pur and unilevers soap business are no exceptions there are many other bop ventures that have continued to suffer from low profits small market size and slow growth including grameen danones nutritious yoghurt development in bangladesh nikes world shoe project in china pgs nutri delight a fortified orange powdered drink in philippines and monsantos sale of genetically modified seeds some of which have left the businessfigure  helps to understand the background to the poor performance of bop  for both companies and society and provides some hints on how to address it it tries to capture the corporate bop businesses in a box diagram measured by two dimensions corporate profit on the vertical axis and development impact on the horizontal axis given the tradeoff between the two challenges the strategy a company can adopt lies in the area inside lower left of the frontier curve shown by the main diagonal with the optimal strategy lying at any point on the frontier if a company located at the top left corner as a profitseeking entity tries to engage in bop business it can achieve development benefits by sliding down along the frontier line from the upper left position ie by sacrificing some of its corporate profits when the bop venture does not yield satisfactory profits meaning that it has moved below the point a at intersection of the frontier line with the acceptable profit level p if the bop business is also unsatisfactory in meeting the development challenge it means that it has not moved beyond the b at intersection with the expected level of development at d in short unsuccessful bop businesses are considered to be located somewhere on the line segment of ab   as mentioned earlier csr the ungc and the mdgs are the background factors that have encouraged mncs to engage in bop business however the increase of these exogenous pressures would also shift the vertical line set at s to the right so that other things being equal line segment ab will become even longer increasing the likelihood that bop business will bring only unsatisfactory resultsthere is a common feature behind these unsatisfactory results of many bop  ventures they were outsidein initiatives to increase consumption by applying existing products and business models created in developed countries with some modifications to the bop segment behind this was the very mindset of approaching the unmet needs of the poor simanis et al  caeque  hart  several serious problems are associated with this approach first the role of the people in the bop segment was seen too much from the perspective of the customers and not enough from the development effect on the mncs side bop business has created a kind of boom at the turn of the st century with the illusion that it would open up unlimited sales opportunities in markets with huge populations however the civil and public sectors as well as the poor people themselves have sometimes criticized the bop business as nothing more than a strategy for selling to the poorsecondly with no existing product market to benchmark against neither firms nor prospective bop customers have a reference point from which to assess whether a given product or service is needed simanis et al  this is why the usual market strategy of understanding the potential needs through deeply listening to prospective customers identifying the market segments to play in and gaining a competitive advantage there cannot be applied while pgs pur business initially saw an enormous potential need in solving the social challenge of preventing infectious diseases with clean water the actual demand generated was so small that the csdw project had to shift to a philanthropic model of healthrelated social marketing campaigns in partnership with a global health npo simanis et al thirdly the outsidein initiatives contain elements of paternalistic attitudes and cultural imperialism which sometimes mean the devaluation of tradition and culture this is likely to provoke a backlash from nonprofit and grassroots organizations as well as from the poor themselves in the past ngos have often monitored the subsidiaries of mncs and led boycotts of their products in protest against environmental degradation and child labour in developing countries with such a history of adversarial relations the basic needs approach relying on an outsidein strategy does not make it easy to forge the partnerships with ngos which are crucial to the success of the bop business   reflecting on the lack of success of bop  the next generation of bop strategies has emerged  bop  a key feature of the bop  is a radically new approach involving the cocreation of products and value propositions by partnering with people from underserved communities london  hart  cocreation refers to working together with companies lowincome communities and other actors to seek to create a fortune with the bop which enabling a deep process of social transformation nahi  bop  not simply aims to focus on markets that previously existed but were unrecognized and to turn the poor into customers for its products as in bop  but also encompasses three elementsinvolving the bop people in the global value chain as producers suppliers and distributors and working with them to cocreate entirely new markets and business modelsproviding employment opportunities for the poor not only to increase their consumption through higher incomes but also to enhance their human capital and empower them through labour participation training and education engaging them in creative activities which can generate bottomup innovation enabling the development of environmentally sustainable technologies with leapfrogging as well as reverse innovation govindarajan  where innovative products from the bop flow back to developed countriesbop  will be therefore culturally embedded socially and environmentally sustainable and profitable business  more inclusive business  which is what the bop people want  unilevers indian subsidiary hlls project shakti meaning empowerment is often described as the next generation bop initiative prahalad  although not yet fully successful in terms of profitability probably due to unilevers heavy financial burden and high turnover the project is considered a bop  scheme as it involves innovation for the last mile  the penetration of the companys products into traditionally unreachable rural india through direct sales using local womens channels  while at the same time contributing to society by spreading the concept of hygiene and thereby improving health creating employment improving human capital empowering people and making women more selfreliant and socially empowered  hll has set up a sales and distribution organization that contracts women called shakti amma as selfemployed traders who buy and sell unilever products on consignment and receive a success fee this enabled unilever to penetrate rural areas where twothirds of indias population lives at a cost more than  less than through traditional sales agents and to promote unilever products through word of mouth rangan  rajan  in particular the expansion of sales of annapurna salt an iodized salt developed by unilever in  has had a breakthrough effect in preventing iodine deficiency disorder which may cause mental retardation in children and has contributed considerably to reducing the health problems of indias lowincome population who do not have access to a balanced diet shakti amma now numbering more than one million has not only become unilevers favorite customer by enhancing her and her familys livelihoods by earning the same level of income as men month but has also become an entrepreneur by developing her skills through training and onsite practice in product knowledge revenue and logistics management and contractual concepts helping her to become spiritually independent through increased financial independence and dignity it has also played a complementary role to microfinance by making shakti amma a selfhelp group with joint savings and loans among its members which in turn induces bank loans and new business startups in collaboration with local government agencies and local ngos the project has also been effective in recruiting and nurturing talented shakti amma with local knowledge and a desire to lift themselves out of poverty and become selfreliant  again figure  shows us the logic behind the bop  which is realized when a company can further enhance either its own economic profits or social benefits without sacrificing the other the social contributions brought about by the project shakti at unilevers expense  increased employment poverty alleviation spread of marketbased economy improved health and sanitation womens empowerment etc  will not necessarily undermine the companys financial bottom line because it will later lead to a reduction in distributor commissions increased productivity through enhanced human capital of shakti amma and increased sales through higher incomes for lowincome groups this means that in figure  when starting from the bop  position indicated by the large circle and seeking to further increase the social benefits on the horizontal axis companies do not need to slide down along the frontier curve arrow  but can move to reach bop  while maintaining corporate profit level p on the vertical axis arrow  in this bop  both the acceptable level at p for corporate profit and the expected level s of social benefit are met making the business sustainable therefore bop  is about internalizing through business model innovation the positive production externalities causing social value rather than giving them up to the absolute altruism as in philanthropy  the transition to bop  has been driven not only by companies efforts to overcome the malfunctioning bop  but also by institutional pressures on mncs to place greater emphasis on social and environmental aspects in particular as table  shows the p initiatives in development successively launched by various international organizations can be seen to have acted as a focal point to encourage companies to be more proactive in fulfilling their social responsibilities as a result of their rational choices they also helped the private sector to find solutions to reconcile its own profitability with social development at a higher level even in difficult market conditions with high poverty levels by providing specific policy recommendations and illustrating other companies initiatives as best practices for example the  report of the un commission on the private sector and development unleashing entrepreneurship making business work for the poor summarized recommendations for building the capacity of the private sector to advance the development process set out in the mdgs with particular emphasis on providing opportunities for income generation through decent work the growing inclusive markets gim initiative launched by the united nations development programme undp in  and its report creating value for all published in  highlighted the importance of inclusive business which involves the poor in global value chains as consumers producers employers and workers and provided many different examples of good practices on such business other undpled strategies such as inclusive market development imd in  and business call to action bcta in  have also sought to promote private sector engagement in the bop development process with recommendations on how to build business models that simultaneously achieve commercial and development objectives similar efforts to get companies and ngos to work more on development issues at the bop can be seen in other un agencies such as food and agriculture organization fao world food programme wfp world health organization who and un international childrens emergency fund unicef in each own areas of expertise all these efforts of international organizations have thus served as a catalyst for the private sector to take a more active role in bop business while maintaining their own interestsbop businesses need to and will evolve further to more effectively address the social challenges faced by the bop while at the same time ensuring corporate profitability against this background the bop  has recently been proposed caeque  hart  although this initiative is still in an embryonic stage and the real picture has not yet become clear some directions can be discerned one is to push cocreation in the bop  age even further and move towards open innovation as already mentioned cocreation was about working together with local companies and other different actors to develop new business models that create value for local communities at the bop open innovation on the other hand is a distributed innovation process based on purposively managed knowledge flows across organizational boundaries chesbrough et al  which is opposed to traditional closed innovation pursued inhouse or through vertical integration where companies have sought to build its competitive advantages based on its proprietary technology through speeding up the new products development but increasing silos of technology were making it more and more difficult to create innovation through inhouse research and development rd the boundaries between a firm and its external environment have become more permeable due to lower transaction costs in the marketplace and advances in information and communication technology ict and increasing the transfer of technology and ideas inward and outward between organizations and individuals can be expected to stimulate innovation within the organization which will then be extended outside the organization chesbrough  technology and ideas should not be confined to within an organization but need to be allowed to flow in and out of it in order to stimulate innovation compared to the cocreation emphasized in bop  which was a bottomup innovation that took place hand in hand with the people at the bop open innovation is a more participatory grassroots innovation that harnesses the knowledge of the cloud distributed across different sectors and actors  whether it be private government or citizens or formal or informal  to create solutions that would have been previously unforeseeable caeque  hart  as an extension of this open innovation frugal innovation has been attracting growing attention in recent years zeschky et al  bhatti  ventresca  it is called frugal as it is a way of developing products and services that are more affordable and more easily accessible by implementing only the features that are really needed it is frugal because it meets the basic needs of the bop people in a lean way hence conserving resources and making society and the planet more sustainable frugal innovation is a locallyadaptive solution that develops and provides products and services which are good enough and affordable to meet the needs of consumers under severe constraints of financial technological material and other resources bhatti  ventresca  exactly as the bop situation is those people who would otherwise be unable to afford existing products and services it can be said that frugal innovation is a model of social contribution that emphasizes the reduction of the global environmental footprint by providing products and services in a resourcesaving manner ie by reducing not creating public bad whereas the conventional bop business aimed to contribute to society by expanding public good ie by alleviating poverty through delivering products and services to the poorhowever this may not be an easy task for the mncs from developed countries since their business models and organizations are traditionally designed for the development of advanced products for the affluent few at the top in order to overcome such strategic and organizational barriers and achieve frugal innovation it will be necessary to give substantial degree of autonomy to local subsidiaries of mncs to enable them to deploy open innovation zeschky et al   the second direction for the bop  is to make use of the business ecosystem business ecosystem refers to an economic community of a large number of loosely interconnected participants clarysse et al  they may be organizations or individuals and come together in such community in a partially intentional highly selforganizing and even somewhat accidental manner moore  p these participants include customers suppliers workers competitors and other stakeholders such as financing trade associations standards bodies labor unions and governmental and quasigovernmental institutions moore  in the context of the bop human resource cultivators supply chain players technology and microfinance providers and even neighboring residents are also constituents of the business ecosystem their relationships could be cooperative or competitive with each participant specializing in a particular activity and depending on each other for their mutual performance in other words the collective efforts of many participants create value but individual efforts have no value outside of the collective effort clarysse et al  unlike conventional interfirm networks which tend to be geographically dense to some extent business ecosystems form value networks that are distributed across borders and around the worldthe bop  emphasized the need to engage people from the bop community in the local activities of mncs to promote bottomup innovation however since an ecosystem is a network of actors with many horizontal relationships moore  as well as vertical many of its members fall outside the traditional value chain which is formed by a linear process from upstream to downstream iansiti and levien  hence meaning that the innovation model of bop  will not be able to tap into the diversity of species inhabiting the ecosystem in order for bop businesses to evolve further it will be necessary to incorporate companies themselves as part of a larger ecosystem caeque  hart  it is not about involving the bop people into their own global value chain but about the mncs themselves becoming part of the business ecosystem both locally embedded and extending beyond regional boundaries therefore it will be essential to view the business ecosystem as a ground for innovation in order to fully exploit the potential of open innovation discussed aboveinnovation in business ecosystems focuses on the customer demand side rather than on technological activities in other words it is an activity aimed at generating value for the customer rather than new knowledge clarysse et al  firms can collaborate with other participants in the business ecosystem to create and deliver solutions that satisfy the full package of value to customers that they could not create alone moore  such innovations may involve the creation of new markets and are well suited to the relatively small and poorly defined commercial opportunities that need to be pursued clarysse et al  and therefore it is a suitable model for innovation at the bop at the bop the market economy  a network of buyers and sellers interacting to trade goods and services via price  is not functioning as it is in developed countries the participants in the ecosystem are not just companies but a wide range of actors seamlessly and intricately linked together to form a single business sphere it is not based on market principles but on the dominant principles of community  a group whose ties are based on trust through dense human interaction such as bonds blood relations geographical ties camaraderie and ethnic cohesion  which are maintained through implicit contracts many poor people are engaged in the informal sector and are deprived of legal ownership property rights education rights etc which are largely beyond the reach of normal means of distribution credit transactions and communication it is therefore essential for mncs to network with these nontraditional actors especially if they want to create noneconomic and social value the strength of mncs is that they can reorganize their ecosystems in a way that is not based solely on customary mechanisms as in the past by bringing in transparent market mechanisms for this purpose ict can be used as it helps to eliminate opportunistic behaviour williamson   selfish actions such as cheating of shirking which will undermine the potential of the transaction  through reducing information asymmetries between buyers and sellers thus allowing the market mechanism to function and realizing a fair trade ict will also enable joint tasks between organizations and individuals within business ecosystem to be undertaken and coordinated using internetbased technologies in conjunction with facetoface interaction corall et al  thus connecting companies and individuals in the same ecosystem across traditional industry sectors and national boundaries by evolving business ecosystems into digital business ecosystems each company or individual will be able to exchange digital knowledge with other members and add one or more different aspects of product or service value to the value created by the ecosystem enabling to provide customized solutions to the people at the bopyet such a process of building relationships and creating business ecosystems with many different stakeholders is lengthy and pathdependent moreover companies need to play a pivotal role in the ecosystem to orchestrate the coordination of interests to conceive a business model that satisfies social needs and to secure their own profits which can be a daunting task however this is precisely why it can be a source of sustained competitive advantage through accumulating resources  ability to conceive of profitable businesses within such ecosystem  that are difficult to imitate and preventing others from entering barney  it is precisely in this respect that solving social problems and pursuing economic interests once thought to be opposites can be now perfectly aligned looking back again at figure  this situation where companies can increase their economic profits or more precisely their sources of competitive advantage exactly by addressing these very social challenges can be illustrated by the shift of the frontier curve which shows the feasible combination of the two tradeoffs to the upper right and the corresponding shift of bop business to the bop  position arrow  such a leap can be made through open innovation which leverages the widely distributed knowledge across the bop communities frugal innovation that is resourceconserving and truly meets the basic needs of bop people and inclusive innovation that comes from embedding companies themselves in ecosystems and building truly inclusive businessesthe third direction for bop  is to broaden the perspective of the challenges faced by bop from poverty reduction to sustainable development initially the motivation for bop business was focused on alleviating poverty by leveraging the resources and capabilities of the private sector especially mncs to deliver products and services affordable to the bop population bop  and then provide them with the means to earn a living bop  but now it will become increasingly important to consider the tbl incorporating other development challenges such as environmental sustainability  the sustainable development goals sdgs adopted at the un summit in september  set out  specific targets in  areas of development goals for the period  to  they were introduced as a successor to the mdgs expired in  which had eight set goals in addition to poverty hunger and health which have already been emphasized in the mdgs the sdgs also encompass a wider range of environmental issues including climate change energy and ecological system as well as other social issues such as human development decent work womens empowerment and inequality all of which are precisely the challenges faced by the bop and overcoming them is defined as an essential condition for sustainability hence the sdgs have a high affinity with bop business and as the sdgs gain ground companies are likely to become more proactive about engaging in sdg business management incorporating those goals into bop business   recently there has been increasing pressure from the investor side to get companies to adopt sdgs in their business some of the major developments are summarized in table  such pressure originally started as socially responsible investing sri which is an investment practice that requires investee companies to manage their businesses in a csroriented manner after the manifestation of environmental problems on a global scale from the late s and the spread of the tbl concept in the s sri became more active in which companies are evaluated in terms of the environment environmental impact such as global warming and resource destruction and society impact on social stakeholders poverty alleviation and reduction of inequality as well as corporate profitability and investors decisions have become to be made based on these three aspects in  the united nations announced the principles for responsible investment pri and the subsequent increase in the number of institutional investors signing up to the pri has accelerated the trend towards incorporating an assessment on g governance appropriateness of corporate management processes into their investment decisions in addition to those on tbl financial environmental and social bottom lines  which has came to be known as esg investing  prioritizing optimal environmental social and governance factors or outcomes in the aftermath of the  financial crisis such esg investing expanded rapidly global sustainable investment alliance  in response to criticism that excessive capitalism overstressing shortterm returns had caused instability in financial markets more recently impact investing which places greater emphasis on the impact of social and environmental issues breast  born  has grown even faster than esg investing these esg and impact investment decisions require investee companies mncs in particular to internalize the positive and negative social externalities they generate as a cost of capital while at the same time those investors also are known to place high demands on the financial profitability for investees put differently in figure  such changes in investors behavior mean that while maintaining or even shifting upward the acceptable level of profitability set at p the expected level of development impact set at s will shift further to the right and unless the bop business model is further evolved by integrating it with sdg business management it will be difficult to achieve a balance between corporate profits and social contributionthe development challenges contained in the sdgs are not just for the poor but many of them need to be addressed by the international community as a whole including those belonging to top and mop in developed and emerging countries as the sdgs emphasize the importance of multistakeholder partnerships the resources and capabilities of the private sector especially those of mncs are expected to play a major role in addressing these challenges in sdg business management as in bop business the essential question is how to reconcile social with the economic interests therefore an effective approach to sdg business management will be to advance the analytic generalization yin  which describes the logic of bop business as a relationship between abstracted key variables and to increase the generalizability of the model to sdg business management it will also be possible to provide valuable implications for the bop business based on the findings from the analysis of the sdg managementfor example frugal innovation which was initially focused on bop customers could also be applied as a concept to address issues on a more global level such as environmental eg global warming ocean pollution deforestation demographic eg aging population population decline and explosion and socioeconomic changes eg widening inequality increasing crossborder migrations agarwal  brem  the growing interest in resourceconscious and minimalist consumption in developed countries also suggests that the concept of  frugality may be applied in these markets as well such application to markets other than bop may also enable generalization of the theory of frugal innovation beyond just cheap innovations to the creation of sustainable innovations that are more resource efficient minimizing the use of resources such as water electricity and time and have a higher value proposition better quality ease of availability etc the same also holds true for reverse innovation reverse innovation which initially emerged as a product of bop business practices also served as a useful business model in the recovery process in japan where the tsunami caused by the great east japan earthquake in march  devastated lifelines caeque  hart a report released by the un in  warns that while progress towards the sdgs has been made in some areas overall they are significantly off the track to be achieved un  the covid pandemic has further delayed those efforts and progress towards the goals has stalled or even regressed in many areas including poverty hunger healthcare education and inequality however the pandemic also provides a great opportunity for countries to change the course of this current trend and build recovery plans to change consumption and production patterns for a more sustainable future that is not to return to the world before corona but to redesign our economies and societies to be more sustainable and resilient in order to build a better world in the with corona period or towards the after corona era how do we balance business with social challenges such as ensuring public health establishing a new normal in response to workplace and lifestyle changes and ensuring equitable distribution among stakeholders how to restore global supply chains disrupted by border blockades and contagion of economic shocks hasegawa  and how to develop business continuity planning bcp these are pressing issues for sdg business management and are no stranger to companies around the world  shortly after bop business began to gain attention the concept of creating shared value csv has been proposed as a way for companies to combine the pursuit of economic profit with social contribution porter  kramer  csv means that when a company creates social value by addressing social issues and problems it also creates economic value as a result unlike csr which is based on the premise that solving social problems and pursuing economic profit collide with one another and returns or sacrifice profits in the spirit of philanthropy csv aims to integrate social contribution and business according to porter csv is a strategy that allows companies to gain a competitive advantage over their rivals in a differentiated way porter  kramer  by boldly challenging social needs previously left to public bodies or notforprofit sector or abandoned altogether and meeting those needs in the marketplace companies can create economic value that their competitors never could csv thus rather than looking for a compromise between economic and social focuses on creating synergies between the two in a mutually enhancing relationship which is quite similar to the bop  concept described earlier  if the seeds of csv business lie in unmet social needs kramer  pfitzer  such needs are inexhaustible not only at the bop of the poor countries but also in other regions including developed countries or emerging economies many developed countries are facing social problems such as falling birthrates aging and declining populations and growing crossborder migrations while issues such as gender inequalities social disparities human capital degradation and lack of decent living are common challenges across the world beyond the bop market on a planetary scale meeting the needs of the worlds population which is expected to reach  billion by  while achieving growth without exceeding available resources eg foods water and energy or causing environmental devastation is an extremely difficult agenda for humanity csv aims to make this possible as well as bop  and sdg businesscompanies themselves will take the initiative in solving social challenges and gain a competitive advantage this is what the new capitalism based on csv is all about and the same is true for bop  and sdg business management such a new capitalism if realized will be far more powerful and effective than the traditional one consisting of profitmaximizing businesses and wealthredistributing governments and will be the engine that drives social change toward sustainability the question of how to reconcile the economic and the social by integrating findings and insights that have been hitherto conceived under different terms and concepts such as bop business sdg business management csv social business inclusive business etc is a key issue for business practitioners scholars and policy makers and will become increasingly active in the coming years, bop business of multinational companies and sustainability    what is the bop business   figure    figure      birth of the bop business

Research paper_Journal article,SHBMJ_9.docx,Other,SHBMJ_9.docx, we report a rare case of brain tumor metastasis with intracerebral hemorrhage from nonuterine derived leiomyosarcoma a yearold man who underwent resection for the right thigh leiomyosarcoma chemotherapy was introduced for multiple lung metastases one year after initial diagnosis two years after the initial surgery multiple brain lesions were found which were suspected as metastatic brain tumors he received stereotactic radiotherapy however he complained right hemiparesis and mri revealed tumor progression of the right frontal lesion with peritumoral hematoma he underwent en bloc tumor and hematoma resection histopathological examination indicated the presence of pleomorphic spindle and epithelioid cells with highly atypical nuclei prominent necrosis and hemorrhage these histopathological features were compatible with the primary leiomyosarcoma notably hematoma contained tumor cells to date only  cases of brain metastasis including present case from nonuterine derived leiomyosarcoma have been reported importantly more than half of nonuterine derived leiomyosarcoma occurred with hemorrhage together with our case that hematoma contained tumor cells en block tumor resection including surrounding hematoma should be considered to prevent dissemination of metastatic brain tumor from nonuterine derived leiomyosarcoma leiomyosarcoma is highly malignant tumor occurring in uterus gastrointestinal tract and extremities this often metastasize to lung pelvis but rarely to the brain while most reported brain metastasis were derived from uterine leiomyosarcoma only  cases of brain metastasis from nonuterine primary site which includes extremities duodenum and retroperitoneum have been reported herein we present a case of thigh leiomyosarcomaderived brain metastasis which harbored peritumoral hematoma we also review the past case reports to reveal clinical characteristics of this rare metastatic brain tumor a yearold man presented with his right thigh swelling magnetic resonance imaging mri revealed a contrastenhanced tumor with hemorrhagic and unclear bordered component fig a open biopsy was performed and the tumor was diagnosed as leiomyosarcoma subsequently he underwent extensive tumor resection of the right thigh leiomyosarcoma macroscopically dense proliferation of tumor cells composed of spindle and epithelioid cells with pleomorphic nuclei was observed necrosis and hemorrhage were also apparent fig b c since pathological examination revealed showed no tumor cells at the resection margin the patient did not receive additional therapy however one year after the surgery computed tomography ct showed multiple lung metastases although four courses of adriamycin were administrated as the first line chemotherapy the lung lesions were progressed unfortunately pazopanib as the second line chemotherapy did not induce stable disease two years after the initial surgery mri revealed multiple brain tumors at the frontal lobe temporal lobe and brain stem fig a b treatment with eribulin as the third line chemotherapy and stereotactic radiotherapy for the brain metastases were performed two months later he suddenly complained leftside hemiparesis ct and mri demonstrated progressed tumor of the right frontal lesion which was in a  mm maximum diameter including peritumoral hemorrhage fig ce on the other hand the other  brain metastases were disappeared to avoid further neurologic deterioration we performed tumor resection at the right frontal lesion macroscopic findings indicated that the tumor was extended to the subpial surface and surrounded by hemorrhage fig a we performed en bloc tumor and hematoma resection fig f on microscopic examination spindle and epithelioid cells with marked nuclear pleomorphism were observed and necrosis and hemorrhage were present the tumor cells existed into hematoma and also extended to the subarachnoid space fig b c immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that smooth muscle markers desmin and caldesmon were positive in the tumor cells and ki index was approximately   fig df in addition vascular endothelial growth factor vegf was diffusely positive in the tumor cells fig g these pathological findings were similar to those in the primary lesion and were compatible with brain metastasis of leiomyosarcoma derived from thigh after surgical resection hemiparesis was improved and he was transferred to another hospital for rehabilitation leiomyosarcoma occur in uterus gastrointestinal tract and less common in extremities because of the most common subtype uterine leiomyosarcoma is the single sitespecific group on the other hand leiomyosarcoma of other sites are grouped as nonuterine leiomyosarcoma due to its rarity indeed distinct methylation and mrna signature pattern was demonstrated between uterine and soft tissue leiomyosarcoma  since there are only review articles of brain metastasis in uterine derived leiomyosarcoma we focused nonuterine cases in this study and summarized their clinical characteristics to our best knowledge there have been only  cases of brain metastasis from nonuterine derived leiomyosarcoma reported including our case table  the primary lesions included extremities duodenum and retroperitoneum five cases had single lesion while  cases including our case showed multiple lesions eight cases also had lung metastases which were mostly diagnosed approximately one year before brain metastasis two cases accompanied with leptomeningeal dissemination these findings underlie that hematogenous metastasis may penetrate to the arachnoid vessels followed by leptomeningeal dissemination in the present case the tumor cells were pathologically confirmed within the subarachnoid space this indicates the presence of leptomeningeal dissemination therefore closed mri and wholebody scanning is required for detecting further metastasisinterestingly  of   cases demonstrated cooccurrence of tumor with hemorrhagic components this frequency is quite higher than other primary site derived brain metastasis considering that only  occur with intracranial hemorrhage although renal cell carcinomas and melanomas tend to have hemorrhagic brain metastases compared to other type of cancer their odds ratios is about  and  respectively although underlying mechanism of tumor hemorrhage in nonuterine leiomyosarcomaderived brain metastasis remains unclear hematogenous seeding and rapid growth may be partly contributing to bleeding by damaging peritumoral vessels also leiomyosarcoma are often rich in angiogenesis which is partly induced by vegf leading to necrosis and tumor bleeding indeed the primary and brain lesions in our case demonstrated tumor bleeding along with highly expressed ki and vegf and prominent necrotic component suggesting rapid tumor growth and angiogenesis because of rarity of nonuterine leiomyosarcomaderived brain metastasis frequency of cerebral hemorrhage remains undetermined however the fact that more than half tumors accompanied with intracerebral hemorrhage suggesting that nonuterine leiomyosarcoma related brain metastasis commonly accompanies with intracerebral hemorrhage these findings suggest that nonuterine leiomyosarcomaderived brain metastasis may induce rapid neurological deterioration by intracerebral hemorrhage and may require early therapeutic intervention tumor bleeding is classified into intra and extratumoral hemorrhage and our case corresponds to the latter importantly as hematoma contained the tumor cells en block tumor resection including surrounding hematoma should be considered to prevent dissemination of tumor cellsin conclusion we reported a rare case of thigh leiomyosarcomaderived brain metastasis only  cases of nonuterine leiomyosarcomaderived brain metastasis have been reported to date of note  of tumors presented with intracerebral hemorrhage this indicates that intracerebral hemorrhage may be a common clinical feature of nonuterine leiomyosarcomaderived brain metastasisfigure  clinicopathological feature of thigh

Response to reviewer comments,SKKUN_7622_2.docx,Response to reviewer comments,SKKUN_7622_2.docx,thank you for your kind consideration of our manuscript entitled thrombin preconditioning improves the therapeutic efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells in severe intraventricular hemorrhage induced neonatal ratswe would also like to thank the reviewer for the very helpful and insightful remarks we believe that reviewers comments and suggestions improved the quality of our paperfor the reviewers convenience corrections we made are marked in blue color text in the revised manuscript the reviewer stated the provided reference  supports the use of whartons jellyderived mscs and umbilical cord blood ucbderived mscs as a source of diabetes mellitus cell therapy in term of insulin production is there any data support compare the use of whartons jelly and ucbderived mscs in study similar to the current study such as neuronal cytotoxicity or inflammation we appreciate the reviewers comment although we previously conducted experiment using ucbderived mscs in the ivh neonatal rat model reference  we used whartons jelly wjderived mscs in the present study from the perspective of industrial development since wjderived mscs are easier to harvest expand and produce on a large scale than ucbmscs line which is commented in the reference  we dont have any data to compare the efficacy between ucb vs wjderived mscs against neuronal cytotoxicity or inflammation occurring in neonatal ivh animal model  the reviewer stated some of the terms or reasoning for the experiments are not clear for readers for examples what is the function of glial fibrillary acidic protein and ed how is it related to cell death we histologically observed levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein gfap tunelpositive cells and edpositvie cells as markers for reactive gliosis apoptotic cell death and activated microglia respectively because increases in reactive gliosis cell death and microglia activation are universal reaction to inflammatory brain injury we have incorporated this into result section  line  and result section  line   the reviewer stated the authors have published a series of interesting studies regarding thrombinpreconditioning of mscs it seems like the beneficial effects of thrombin preconditioned mscs is due to the increase production of extracellular vehicles evs how is the transplantation of preconditioned mscs compared to evs secreted from the preconditioned mscs in treating ivh in vivo we appreciate the reviewers kind comment in the present study since we have not directly compared the efficacy of thrombin preconditioned mscs and evs isolated from mscs it is unknown whether the efficacy of these two conditions would be similar or not further studies are needed to clarify this line  the reviewer stated in line  the author mentioned about the antioxidant effects of mscs it is not clear which data supported this statement we measured the antioxidant effect of mscs by measuring level of malondialdehyde mda using oxiselect tbars assay kit mda quantitation in thrombininduced neuronal injury in vitro model because malondialdehyde mda is one of the most used biomarkers for lipid peroxidation mscs significantly reduced the level of mda as shown in figure c we have incorporated this into result section in revised manuscript line   the reviewer stated in method section oxiselect tbars assay is mentioned where is the result we used oxiselect tbars assay kit to quantify the level of malondialdehyde mda a marker for oxidative stress we have incorporated this into method section line  the result has been presented in panel c of figure  the reviewer stated the levels of secretory inflammatory cytokines were measured from the cerebrospinal fluid is the any histological assessment of these cytokines in the brain tissues in our previous study we measured the levels of inflammatory cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid csf and brain tissue and we observed excellent positive correlation between the cytokine levels in csf and brain tissues reference  and  thus in the present study we measured the cytokine levels in csf only not in brain tissue line the reviewer commented the authors analyzed the impact of thrombin preconditioning on the therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells in severe intraventricular hemorrhage showing that thrombin priming significantly reduces the markers of brain injury as well as functional impairments the study is innovative however information about the experimental procedures and data analysis crucial to evaluate the presented results representativeness are missing the reviewer stated all figure legends must indicate the number of animalsgroup to which the data presented in the graphs correspond moreover it would be more informative about the variability of the data if the graphs were presented as dot plots according to the reviewers recommendation we have indicated the number of animalsgroup in all figure legends and presented information about the variability of the data as dot plots in figure  in the revised manuscript the reviewer stated image presented in panel d should be improved due to the small size the figure is of no use since it does not allow you to see the differences expressed in the graph of the same panel to show the image in detail we have inserted the enlarged images shown in figure d into supplementary material supplementary figure s and incorporated this into the legend of figure d line  in the revised manuscript the reviewer stated panel e the authors must clarify whether bndf was determined in cell extracts or in the medium the legend of this panel would be more informative if stating bdnf protein levels in we have determined the protein level of bdnf in the medium according to the reviewers recommendation we incorporated this into the legend of figure e line  the reviewer stated figure legend  the figure legend should indicate how many independent cell preparations the data shown in the graphs correspond to all the in vitro analyses in figure  were performed using mscs prepared at one time we have incorporated this in the legend of figure  line  the reviewer stated it would be convenient to include an introductory sentence to the studies in the animal model according to the reviewers recommendation we have incorporated an introductory sentence on animal model as follows neonatal ivh was induced at postnatal day p by infusing l of fresh whole blood obtained from mother rat into the bilateral ventricles two days after ivh induction nave or thrombin preconditioned mscs was transplanted into the ventricle survival rate and body weight was observed from p to p this introductory sentence on the animal model in the survival and body weight section in result section line  the reviewer stated the data presented show that the ivh treatment with nave mscs inm group has a higher mortality rate than the ivh control ci group these data are somewhat surprising and seem to be out of agreement with the lower cell death microgliosis and recovery of the inm group compared to the ci group the discussion should address these apparently nonconcordant data in the present study there was no statistical difference for survival rate between in the ivh control ic group and ivh with nave msc treatment inm group  of  died in ic group and  of  died in inm group however the nave mscs showed an effect on neuronal cell protection in in vitro study additionally the nave mscs significantly attenuated the number of dead cells and activated microglia and slightly improved sensorimotor functions in surviving animals in vivo study it might be suggested that nave mscs also have efficacy but not as potent as thrombinpreconditioned mscs in significantly improving mortality rate antiinflammation and sensorimotor function  the reviewer stated in addition to assess the relevance of the survival data more accurately the initial and final number of animals per group should be indicated we have indicated the initial and final number of animals per group in the figure legend of supplementary figure  the reviewer stated the term light intensity is rarely used in this context and it is more common to use the designation fluorescence intensity according to the reviewers recommendation we have corrected the term light intensity to fluorescence intensity in result section method section and legend in figure a line     the reviewer stated the sentence however the reduction in the number of tunelpositive cells was more significant after transplantation of thrombinpreconditioned mscs than after transplantation of nave mscs lines  is not correct when compared to the ic group both inm and itm show significant differences the authors can refer that the effect observed in the itm group is higher than that of the inm group as there are statistically significant differences when comparing these two groups but not that the effect is more significant according to the reviewers recommendation we have corrected the sentence to however the effect of reducing the number of tunelpositive cells was higher in itm group than inm group line  the reviewer stated the images for panel a gfap labeling are not representative of the data shown in the respective graph since the fluorescence intensity for gfap is clearly much higher in the ic group compared to the inm group contrary to what is shown in the graph as according to the reviewers recommendation we have replaced the representative image of inm group for panel a in figure  the reviewer stated legend of figure   revise the sentence there are immunofluorescence micrographs of the ventricle area with staining and average graphs for a gfap red b tunel green and c ed red the nucleus was visualized with dapi blue original magnification  each graph is represented by an average the parts underlined and highlighted do not seem to make sensein figure legend of figure  we have corrected the sentence to immunofluorescence micrographs of the ventricle area with staining and average graphs for a gfap red b tunel green and c ed red the nucleus was visualized with dapi blue original magnification  according to the reviewers recommendation line  the reviewer stated the legend should indicate how many animals the data presented in the graphs correspond to how many slices were analyzed per animal and how many fieldsslice the information can be provided in the legend or alternatively detailed in the methods section we have indicated the number of animals per groups in histological analyses we observed total six fields two fields right and left ventricle were captured in one brain slice and three brain slices were analyzed we have incorporated this into method section line  and line  and  and the legend of figure  the reviewer stated the sentence however the reduction in the number of tunelpositive cells was more significant after transplantation of thrombinpreconditioned cells in line  is not correct and should be revised according to the data presented the inm group does not show any reduction in the inflammatory cytokines analyzed when compared to the ic group only the itm group presents a reduction of cytokines when compared to the ic group we have revised the sentence however this reduction was more significant after transplantation of thrombinpreconditioned mscs than after transplantation of nave mscs to however the effect of reducing the number of edpositive cells was higher in itm group than inm group line  the reviewer stated in figure  the graphs in panels a and b have no legend on the yaxis in panel c the units the time unit should be represented as s and not sec we apologize the missing legend on the yaxis of figure  we have indicated the legend on the yaxis and we have corrected the time units to s in figure  the reviewer stated in panel b it is not clear what differences the asterisk in day  refers to we performed the rotarod test three consecutive days from postnatal day p  to p therefore the term day  day day in panel b of figure  have been corrected to postnatal day p  p p in our revised manuscript in the rotarod performance skill meaningful differences among groups were observed from p thus we have presented the asterisk at p and p the reviewer stated regarding the data presented in panel c it should be indicated if there are statistically significant differences between group ic and inm we have reconfirmed the significant difference between group ic and inm using a statistical program however there was no statistically significant difference between the groups when the statistical comparisons between the groups were performed using oneway anova and tukeys post hoc analysis the reviewer stated in the figure legend the following information should be revised  p   compared with the ivh treatment with thrombinpreconditioned whartons jellyderived msc group  according to what is shown in the graph  indicates the difference in relation to the group itself we apologize the mistake we made the  indicates that p   compared with ic ivh control group we have corrected this in the legend of figure  the reviewer stated in line  it is mentioned behavioral function that is a broad term since the sentence is related to the results from the rotarod test it will be more accurate and precise to correct to motor function according to the reviewers recommendation we have corrected the term behavioral function to motor function in our revised manuscript line   the reviewer stated in line  should be included in the sentence from which test day are the described results we performed the rotarod test three consecutive days from postnatal day p  to p we observed a significant improvement in itm group compared to ic group at p we have incorporated this into result section line  and  and the legend in figure  the reviewer stated in line  the beginning of the sentence should be revised since the effect of the preconditioned mscs was assessed in a separate experimental group itm that was administered with the cells  days after the lesion induction thus this part of the sentence is misleadingwe appreciate the reviewer for the helpful comments to avoid any misunderstanding we have revised the sentence to however the reduced latency significantly improved in the itm group compared to ic group line  the reviewer stated in line  when describing the results from the passive avoidance test the most correct parameter to measure is the latency to enter the dark chamber and not reaction time the reviewer stated the  cell preparation section should mention which was the concentration of thrombin used for the preconditioning of the mscs and the name of the section should be correct to mesenchymal stem cell preparation to better distinguish it from the in vitro modelwe have indicated the concentration of thrombin  uml used for the preconditioning of the mscs line  additionally the name of the section has corrected to mesenchymal stem cell preparation according to the reviewers recommendation line  the reviewer stated the  in vitro model of thrombininduced neuronal injury should be described in more detail it should be indicated whether cortical cells and mscs are cultured simultaneously or if mscs are added later in which case detail when this was done the neuronal cells were exposed to thrombin  u overnight to mimic in vivo hemorrhagic conditions after thrombininduced neuronal cell injury nave mscs or thrombinpreconditioned mscs were treated with concentrate of  x  cells per ml line  the reviewer stated an ethical statement for the approval of the in vivo experiments is missing all animal experiments were reviewed and approved by institutional review board of sungkyunkwan university the study followed the institutional and national institutes of health guidelines for laboratory animal care all animal procedures were performed in an aaalacaccredited specific pathogen free facility of sungkyunkwan university the ethical statement on in vivo experiments have been indicated in method section line  the reviewer stated in the  animal model section line   instead of referring slowly injected it should be specified which was the rate used for the administration lminute or other appropriate units according to the reviewers recommendation we corrected the sentence to injected at a rate of lmin with l of fresh whole blood line  and to nave or thrombinpreconditioned mscs were injected at very low rate lmin into the right ventricle under stereotaxic guidance in our revised manuscript line  the reviewer stated in all data presented the statistical analyses have the same pvalue p if we take as an example the data presented in figure  for the analysis of ed labeling the differences between the nc and ic groups suggest higher significance levels than the differences between the nc and itm groups however what is indicated is that both have a pvalue  this comment applies to all graphs according to the reviewers recommendation we have presented statistical analysis data in detail by indicating pvalues when p   as well as p   in our revised manuscriptthroughout the text the authors abbreviate mesenchymal stem cells with msc and mscs this should be corrected to

revising our manuscriptanswer as you suggested we have significantly revised the interpretation of table  of the result and the discussion as a whole please take a look at the parts marked in red in this new manuscript or the parts that have been changed by the track change we also deleted some sentences from conclusion some references were excluded while compressively supplementing the discussion and conclusion sectionsthe mean age of the respondents who were heads of households was  years the majority of the heads were male the educational background was as follows high school graduation junior high school graduation or below and the proportion of those with a college degree or higher was small most of marital status were married and bereaved divorced and separated and single were very few working status and occupational status were as follows fulltime workers daily workers unpaid family workers temporary workers nonworkers and selfemployed workers about  of the housing types were owned living floor area was in the order of    m  m   m and   m residential regions were in the order of cities metropolitan cities seoul capital city and rural regions more than fivefourths of the respondents owned a car the normalized household income and total household assets on average were krw  million  and  million  respectively the amount of debt was krw   on averagethis study attempted to find evidence of mental accounting by examining how household debt burden changed depending on who was earmarked for medical expenses this attempt makes a difference from previous studies in that it revealed that household debt burden can vary not only by the size of medical expenses but also by the mental accounting account that is subject to medical expenses the results of this study showed that supporting medical expenses for spousal parents who are not living together increases the probability of causing a household debt burden whereas supporting medical expenses for children and parents not living together does not the results revealed that a household did not recognize medical expenses as one category but separated accounts according to relationships  it also indicates that debt burden differs depending on the psychological distance between separate accounts therefore when dealing with household medical expenses not only the size of medical expenses but also the psychological aspect of the household should be consideredtheyalso indicated thatmedical expense support forthe parents of the spouse livingseparatelywasan unexpected event outside the households daily budget medical expenses for a person in a relationship within a certain distance may already be prepared within the actual or psychological budget range but medical expenses for a person outside the range may be expenditure beyond the scope of the budget such unexpected medical expenses increase the proportion of medical expenses in household consumption expendituresconsequently itincreases the possibility of catastrophic medical expensesincreasingthehousehold debt burden dammeet al moreover the results revealed that the parents of the spouse were notwellprepared for the occurrence of medical events and were dependent on private transfer income the results indicate that problems caused by the medical expenses of one household can have a knockon effect on other households therefore it is necessary to secure a social safety network to prepare for catastrophic medical expenses secondly during the survey periodof householdshadnewly experienced debt burden at the current timecompared to the previous timeand it  was found that medical expensesincreased the likelihood of causing household debt burdenthe results suggest that preemptive policies arerequiredto protectthese households from bankruptcyowingto medical expensesin addition topropergeneralhouseholddebtmanagement some countries including south korea have been implementing a health insurance system for a long time to meet this demand but the ratio of personal contributions still remains highthereforeit is necessary to lower the burden of medical expenses on households by increasing the health insurance coveragehowever reckless expansion of coverage canincrease the burden of health insurance premiumson householdstherefore it is necessary to gradually expand the

 ohara it is relatively easier for fulltime workers to use systems such as a leave of absence but nonfulltime workersare more likely to remain unemployedandhave relatively low income therefore it is

undergo local resection only versus being referred to surgery once the suspected t crc lesion was found the endoscopic resectability was determined on the basis of endoscopic findings such as nonlifting sign pitpattern and surface vascular pattern if the lesion was determined to be endoscopically resectable endoscopic lr was tried and sr was done if the lesion was determined to be endoscopically unresectable if the patient was diagnosed to having any histologic risk factor after primary lr the additional sr was recommended it is possible that those who just had local resection

significant indeed or it was due to the inadequate statistical power caused by small sample size however in our study the pvalue was statistically significant in spite of the small sample size only  patients with t crc undergoing endoscopic resection with only  patients with favorable pathology in our study the recurrence between lr  sr was significantly different even though only  patients with

Research paper_Journal article,UQRNH_29.docx,Research paper_Journal article,UQRNH_29.docx,more than two years have passed since the economic and social chaos known as the coronavirus crisis began during this time especially the tourism transportation retail and food and beverage industries fell into a serious recession president online however the effects for agriculture and food supply and demand have been mixed regarding the sales channels of agricultural products it was widely reported that school lunches were suspended from the end of february  due to the temporary closure of elementary and junior high schools and so on yano research institute ltd on april   a state of emergency was declared for seven prefectures including kanagawa prefecturein such a situation staying at home became a trigger of a boom for bread baking which expanded on a global scale global news in fact according to kawakubo  even with the shrinking demand for many agricultural products due to covid japans wheat imports in  would remain at the almost same level as the previous year in terms of both volume and price in addition a look at google trends for trending words over the past year shows a sharp increase in the number of searches for homemade bread since the middle of february  suggesting an increase in demand for bread baking in japanaccording to toyokeizai online the reasons of global boom in bread baking can be summarized in four points first it is a good way to kill time when people are forced to stay at home due to covid second it can be enjoyed with family third it is a pleasure to make and complete by oneself fourth it is easy to prepare for those who are in charge of cooking in households by using premix such as pancakemix or breadmix we can easily prepare meals for whole family thus many households began baking bread as being forced to deal with the unprecedented situation of staying at home under the pandemic for the suppliers of flour and other wheat products this is a phenomenon that they probably could not expect for wheat producers it can be a useful opportunity to understand the potential for increased demand in the future although covid might be a unique phenomenon we would like to clarify how the rapid increase in demand for bread baking occurred and what kind of consumers demanded it this information will be useful for future demand expansion additionally there is also an interesting study on differences in demand by place of origin according to hosono  lemons domestic supply depends on imports for much of its ratio  in  this situation is similar to current supply and demand for wheat hosono claims that the use of lemons including their peels has increased with the recent health boom and demand for domestically produced lemons is growing in terms of safety and security in the case of flour does demand change depending on originin this paper in order to clarify this point we estimate the demand function for flour and analyze the relationship between the infection status of covid and flour demand for flour products called premix such as pancakemix or breadmix are considered to be in a substitutional relationship therefore in addition to estimating the demand function for flour we also estimate that for premix and clarify the difference in elasticity for each factor to analyze the detailed substitution relationship between the two under pandemicscan data can be used to analyze demand for specific products scan data is the data that is accumulated by monitors who have been collected personal attribute information such as age gender family structure and income in advance and scan purchased products each time they shop the data is accumulated by using barcodes jan codes for the products purchased by the monitors therefore by using scan data it is possible to analyze demand for specific products by controlling personal attributes such as income in this study we will use scan data and attempt to estimate the demand function for flour and premix under the pandemic the scan data used in this study is collected in kanagawa prefecture where the first case of infection was confirmed in japan furthermore kanagawa prefecture was one of the seven object prefectures of the first state of emergency in this study we estimate the demand function for all flour premix purchased by monitors as a single product however since domestic and foreign flour are expected to be recognized and differentiated by consumers place of origin of flour is taken into accountnext the demand function used in this study will be explained in model flour mix the demand function includes only ownprice crossprice and income then covidrelated explanatory variables  are added in model  flour mix to control effects of covid model  flour mix in which origin  and other individual and household attributes  are also added to the explanatory variables to control effects of origin and other individual attributes here price ownprice crossprice and income are taken as logarithmic values therefore these coefficients can be understood as price elasticity and income elasticity respectivelyusing flour as an example the demand function model for monitor household i can be shown as follows where price  is the ownprice price  is the crossprice and  is the income of the householdfor those who have not purchased either flour or premix during the monitored period demand of each explained variable flour or premix is not observed on the other hand for those who have purchased flour and premix at least once the purchased quantity is observed as it is thus in this study the torbit model was applied to estimate the demand function since it is assumed that the lower limit of the explained variable is censored at zero in order to control unobserved factors such as preferences and eating habits which are expected to be different for each monitor we estimate a tobit model with random effects by monitor id  is the latent variable for flour premix demand  is an indicator of the infection status of covid here the number of daily new infections number and a state of emergency emergency are adopted the vector  is a variable that indicates the origin of the product domestic in addition we include a dummy variable that takes the value of  if the product is domestically produced as well as a cross term with it since price elasticity and income elasticity are expected to differ depending on origin we also include a cross term with the emergency dummy for the purpose of understanding how much domestic flour was demanded when whole flours demand increasing under the pandemic the vector  is the income group and personal attributes by monitor  is the error term  j j is the parameter to be estimated in this study we estimated the demand function for all flour and premix as a single product without explicitly considering brand differences specifically we used scan data which is productlevel purchased data then we applied a random effects tobit model to estimate the demand function of flour and premix during the first wave of covid in kanagawa japan the results showed that the parameter of ownprice in the demand function was significantly positive and the price of substitute goods crossprice was significantly negative for both flour and premix suggesting a clear substitution relationship between them based on the magnitude of estimated parameters premix were more likely to be substituted for flour moreover this relationship was more pronounced during the pandemic when people refrained from going out due to the increasing number of infections and the declaration of a state of emergency during the same period demand for flour increased while that for premix decreased in other words consumers who had previously preferred to premix tended to shift their consumption to flour as a result of staying at home it was also found that that domestically produced products had a significant impact on consumer behavior specifically it was found that being domestic added value especially for flour and interestingly the higher the price the more purchased during staying home lastly it was found that damaged workers tend to avoid purchasing flour and consume premix actively this implies that those who work for damaged industry and face income reduction replace their meals with cheaper premix rather than baking bread from scratch this study focused on the first wave of the pandemic and covered the period from january to june  january to june  as a

of those in patients with ovarian serous carcinoma have been previously reported we report the first case of cardiac tamponade secondary to an ovarian clear cell carcinoma occc a yearold woman with recurrent occc presented with worsening cough hart palpitation shortness of breath during fourth line chemotherapy chest xray and computed tomography confirmed pleural effusion with cardiac tamponade she performed pericardial fenestration and drainage for cardiac tamponade pericardial fluid cytology revealed the metastasis of occc she received palliative care and died five months after operation without recurrent cardiac tamponade this case suggests that cytologic findings from pericardial effusion proved to be useful in diagnosing metastasis of ovarian clear cell carcinomakey words ovarian carcinoma clear cell carcinoma cardiac tamponade pericardial effusion cytologyovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic cancer in japan as well as united states patients with ovarian cancer commonly present with intraperitoneal metastasis the pericardial metastasis from ovarian cancer is very rare there are several case reports on the malignant pericardial effusion from ovarian cancer  the almost all cases in those reports were high grade serous carcinoma which is a dominant histologic subtype in epithelial ovarian cancer eoc  there were no reports however on malignant pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade of ovarian clear cell carcinoma occcoccc is the second common histologic subtype in east asian countries especially in japan while relatively rare subtype in the western countries the incidence rate of occc in japan has been increasing and the proportion of occc to epithelial ovarian cancer is now more than   occc is diagnosed at an earlier stage than hgsc endometriosis is identified in more than  of patients with occc and is considered a precursor of occc patients with earlystage disease have a favorable prognosis but patients with advanced or recurrent disease have poor oncologic outcomes occc has been known to have unique cytological features as the presentation of abundant clear cytoplasm rich in glycogen and hobnailed formation mirror ball pattern we report for the first time a case of occc with metastasis leading to malignant pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade we found that cytologic findings from pericardial effusion proved to be useful in diagnosing metastasis of occca yearold woman presented with lower abdominal tumor mass a contrastenhanced computed tomography ct scan identified  x  cm diameter pelvic mass containing both solid and fluid component she underwent primary debulking surgery consisting of hysterectomy bilateral salpingooophorectomy omentectomy appendectomy pelvic and paraaortic

area under the curve auc  on day every  weeks tc therapy were administered as adjuvant therapy followed by consolidation therapy with ptx mgm every  weeks biweekly ptx after four cycles of biweekly ptx supraclavicular and mediastinal lymph nodes metastases were detected she was treated with cisplatin mgm and irinotecan hydrochloride cpt  mgm as the secondline treatment because of disease progression after six cycle of the treatment radiation therapy for the mediastinal and supraclavicular metastatic lymph nodes was given next she received four cycles of docetaxel mgm every  weeks as the thirdline and five cycles of gemcitabine as the fourthline regimen for platinumresistant disease during the fourthline treatment she reported hart palpitation shortness of breath and cough chest xray revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette fig a a ctscan showed pleural effusion after five cycles of the fourthline treatment consistent with cardiac tamponade fig b on physical examination at the time of admission blood pressure was  mmhg and pulse  beat per minute   immediately pericardial fenestration and drainage which drained  ml of pericardial effusion were performed malignant cells were cytologically demonstrated the background of the smears was clear unlike ascites malignant cells were partially found in papillary and balllike clusters with irregular stacking fig a the cells consisted with mirrorball like appearance fig b and collagenous stroma which a homogenous hyaline core was observed in the center of most of tumor cell clusters fig c cytologic findings revealed the metastasis of occc the drain was removed  days later after a marked decrease in pericardial effusionthe patient did not want to continue chemotherapy she received palliative care and died five months after operation without recurrent cardiac tamponade fig  the typical routes of metastasis for ovarian carcinoma are intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal metastases to the pericardium are uncommon occurrences in ovarian cancer in a large retrospective analysis of autopsies with confirmed primary malignancies metastases to the heart and pericardium were present in   pericardial effusion due to cancer is commonly seen in lung and breast cancers melanoma lymphoma and leukemia but it is rare for ovarian carcinoma patients with malignant pericardial effusion can be often asymptomatic in the beginning of metastases of pericardium with the increase in pericardial effusion they experience dyspnea cough chest discomfort heart palpitations or fatigue physical examination may reveal hypotension with a narrow pulse pressure jugular venous distension distant heart sounds tachycardia hepatomegaly cyanosis and peripheral edema pulsus paradoxus is common in moderate or severe tamponade  electrocardiogram the primary diagnostic test used to establish the presence of pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade may demonstrate decreased qrs voltage or electrical alternans and chest xray may reveal an enlarged cardiac silhouette ct scan and echocardiogram are useful for diagnosis of cardiac tamponade andor pleural effusion in the present case chest xray and electrocardiogram before each chemotherapy showed no obvious abnormalities and no subjective symptoms after the onset of symptoms such as palpitations and shortness of breath chest xray and ct scan led to the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade in patients with refractory disease heavily treated patients or possibly patients with mediastinal lymph node metastasis pericardial metastasis should be considered when such symptoms appear cytology and histology must be performed to diagnose pericardial metastasis as the cause of cardiac tamponade although pericardiocentesis is a highrisk procedure in addition to diagnostic significance drainage can be expected to prolong survival and improve quality of life in cases of oncologic emergencies such as cardiac tamponade in the present case we were able to provide home palliative care without pericardial effusion after drainage and the patient survived for  monthsthe cytoplasm of ccc is granular or vacuolated and the nuclei are round to oval moderately polymorphic and typically have large nucleoli unlike serous carcinoma the presence of psammoma bodies is rare it is characterized by small hyperchromatic protruding nuclei surrounding a core of a hyalinized matrix a socalled hobnail pattern light green basement membranelike material in the cell cluster raspberry bodies and ballshaped cluster with extracellular matrix components mirror balls in this case mirrorball like appearance and hobnail cells were observed in pericardial fluid smear ccc can be diagnosed easily from its typical cytologic appearance even at the metastatic sites to our knowledge this is the first report on malignant pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade of occc this case suggests that cytologic findings from pericardial effusion proved to be

Research paper_Journal article,UROUZ_5.docx,Research paper_Journal article,UROUZ_5.docx,in addition to the already known negative impacts that the most recent pandemic has caused on public health and the international economy there are also socioeconomic impacts caused in different countries due to the nonuse of tourism and its benefits especially when restrictions are imposed for air transport in this sense considering airports as the starting point for the air transport to tourist destinations and also the need to redemocratize the tourism in dealing with contagious diseases the main objective of this exploratory study is to propose measures that enable the immunization of tourism in airports to reduce or even eliminate travel restrictions imposed by the pandemic from a random literature review as well as the identification of practical cases this theoretical essay presents measures to contain the spread of respiratory diseases in airports at the strategic management level such as the review of airport business models at the tactical level such as the identification of the airport innovation index and its priority areas of investment and at the operational level such as constant preventive actions since the arrival of passengers visitors or employees at the airport from such airport measures it is believed that tourism can be better explored considering the resumption of air transportthe negative worldwide impacts from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  sarscov pandemic mainly on public health coccia  lau et al  economy bekkers koopman  and social inclusion santos oliveira aldrighi  have generated several uneasiness drawing the attention of governments and researchers from different nations to innovations in containing the spread of the disease especially in relation to tourism and air transportation which has displacement and interactions between people as some of its main featuresthe total contribution of travel and tourism gdp to the global economy have fallen precipitously from  usd  trillion in  to  usd  trillion in  a decrease of  in the same period the global economy gdp retreated  about  million jobs were lost worldwide from  million in  to  million in  in the case of brazil the total contribution of travel and tourism to gdp dropped from  brl  billion in  to  brl  billion in  a decrease of  also representing the fall in the number of jobs in the sector in the country of  from  million in   of total employment to  million in   of total employment wttc  in the specific case of air transport the sector generates around  jobs in brazil and contributes with usd  billion to the countrys gdp iata c that is the sector shows a significant socioeconomic representation as a result any event that interferes with these activities such as pandemics have significant impacts on the generation of employment and income in the countrydifferent practical initiatives have been identified to minimize infections and the harmful effects of the pandemic as in the european case with the implementation of the digital green certificate which covers a vaccination certificate a test certificate and a certificate of recovery which can be used in all eu member states to facilitate the internal free transit ec  also in the united states were imposed measures to contain the spread of the disease in the country such as the requirement of a negative covid viral test taken within three calendar days of travel as well as proof of health care provider having recovered from covid in the  days preceding travel us  even after more than two years of covid identification there are also extreme cases of entry bans in certain countries such as japan jnto  which prohibits the entry of foreigners who have already were within  days before the estimated period of landing in countries like the united states germany and even iceland with about  deaths registered by the disease who in relation to scientific studies thousands of publications have recently been published in the international literature on the subject just to have an idea from boolean searches carried out in scientific publications databases by the terms pandemic and air transport this one in quotation marks only in publications of  and  the following quantities of publications have been identified  documents from the wiley online library base  from the sage  from scopus  from science direct  from emerald and  from springer nature certainly many of these numbers are repeated as the same document can be available in two or more databases simultaneously but the significant amount of studies on a specific topic like this during this short period of time is noteworthythus the relevance of the theme has been clearly identified both for the stateofthepractice and for the stateoftheart although different studies present strategies and methods to contain the spread of the disease furini silva  gaber et al  gold et al  tabares  trentin moraes guimares  even considering the limited knowledge about this pandemic so far there is a need for constant technological vigilance in order to develop new technologies products services and processes in the sense not only to coping this disease but also to prepare for and minimize the negative impacts of new future pandemicsin this sense the main objective of this theoretical essay developed from publications and practices related to the containment of pandemics in airports is to propose a framework with initiatives that can guide airport managers in containing the pandemic for the resumption of air transport and tourism the relevance of this results in relation to the others lies in the need to develop solutions that enable greater inclusion of people in a safe way for everyone and not to propose the exclusion of people from air transport or tourism whether they are suspected of being infected or not because this and other contagiousrespiratory diseases are and will continue to be present and it is necessary to learn to live with them this study is structured in addition to this introduction with the presentation of practical and theoretical proposals related to the containment of the pandemic followed by a framework containing recommendations for the strategic tactical and operational management levels of airports in order to improve the immunization of the tourism in airports finally in the final considerations recommendations for future studies related to the topic are mademuch knowledge has already been obtained and applied in air transport from the international crises that have impacted the sector such as the spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenzahpai known as avian flu or the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus causing significant drops in the number of kilometers traveled by paying passengers expressed in revenue passenger kilometers rpk as shown in figure according to figure  which shows the months before and after the start of the crisis it can be seen that the sector has recovered in at most seven months after the beginning of the crisis something good and also hopeful in light of the most recent crisis however in relation to the sarscov about eighteen months after its onset the great impact it has had on air transport is still noted  figure  from the figure  the sector recovered in this period at rates of around  compared to the initial stage reaching just  billion monthly rpks at the end of the first half of  compared to  billion rpks in the end of  demonstrating a need for different treatment for this new episodedifferent proposals have been identified both in practice and in the literature in order to minimize the impacts of covid infrom air transport studies dealing with the direct relationship between airports and the pandemic have focused especially on techniques and tools used at airports to identify and reduce the spread of disease in aviation in the case proposed by serrano and kazda  the authors propose certain measures to be adopted at airports in order to increase the paperless process with the use of biometric solutions for a minimum passenger contact requiredin addition to the health safety protocols proposed by health organizations specifically in aviation and tourism several initiatives can also be identified in an attempt to cooperate between airlines and airports the international air transport association iata and airports council international aci present aviation resumption measures among their members related to aircraft operators air traffic management and ground operations in joint efforts for the preparation and use of management guidance with suggestions for pre and postflight iata and aci  in brazil initiatives such as responsible tourism turismo responsvel in portuguese created by the ministry of tourism can be identified in order to encourage the adoption of protocols and good management practices to prevent the spread of the disease in establishments in the sector brazil as a measure of directing certain flights to airports with better passenger screening conditions and less chance of spreading the disease the airport administration of tokyo  haneda international airport hnd advises that passenger flights departing from the peoples republic of china or from the republic of korea and arriving at an airport in japan the landing must be redirected to tokyo  narita international airport nrt or kansai international airport kix this latter more than  kilometers away from tokyo kobe simple and immediate actions have also been identified in different international airports as in the case of amsterdam schiphol international airport ams figure  in which adopting the concept of scaleup at the business activities the airport managers seek to improve the business through a redesign of processes in order to increase the number of flights passengers and visitors at the airport schiphol group these measures proposed in figure  are applied both to the passenger aircraft and baggage process as well as the landside accessibility and retail hospitality and services provided at the airportto reduce the exchange of documents between different hands such as boarding passes the initiative of the ministry of infrastructure minfra in partnership with the federal data processing service serpro and the special secretariat for debureaucratization management and digital government of the ministry of economy in brazil proposes an authorization system for passenger access to departure lounges at the airports of so paulo  congonhas airport cgh and rio de janeiro  santos dumont airport sdu based on biometric control through cameras without the need to present a boarding pass minfra  figure  shows an example of one of the access points to the departure lounge with this deviceaccording to figure  the passengers facial identification is combined with the passenger registration photo generated at the time of their checkin obviously the acceptance or not of the use of these technologies by passengers at checkin must be analyzed by each airport as in the study by negri borille and falco  with  passengers at the airports of campinas  viracopos international airport vcp so paulo  congonhas airport cgh and so paulo  guarulhos international airport gru which demonstrates that the probabilities to use biometrics technologies are  among passengers who had already used these technologies and  among passengers who had never had contact with the biometrics on the other hand considering passengers aged  or over as a growing market in tourism due to improvements in quality of life food standards and better medical treatments graham kremarik and kruse  show that among the  uk residents interviewed contactless selfservice technology at the airport is among the least important to the group when they are at an airportdifferent infectious disease detection techniques for an airport terminal are also proposed such as blood sampling  serological tests polymerase chain reaction pcr tests antigen tests or spectrography intrusive tests and body temperature measurement by thermographic cameras respiratory and heart rate or air sniffers nonintrusive tests as well as carrying out health screening in different possible locations during the passenger journey at an airport terminal during the trip as proposed by tabares  in figure in addition to the screening moments of passengers along their journey at the airport shown in figure  tabares  also proposes some necessary steps for a pandemicfree airport as the technical advances on infectious detection means with medical validation and automation at the airport facilities testing to mitigate or replace quarantines establishment of appropriate industry standards and regulations adequate health screening responsibility management worldwide air travel industry stakeholders commitment as well as the public opinion demand and support these are somewhat generic propositions which do not necessarily have specific application to certain airportsit is noteworthy that more recently just to get an idea of access measures to public places such as airports in the case of events that gather a large amount of public the example of the uefa euro  european football championship is taken held between june and july  in eleven cities in different countries amsterdamnz bakuaz bucharestro budapesthu copenhagendk glasgowgb munichde londongb rome it saint petersburgru and sevillees several measures were defined in relation to travel restrictions and stadium entry requirements such as the obligation to quarantine provide a negative covid test result or in more extreme cases the eu travel ban for wales in the case of amsterdam and travel ban or mandatory quarantine period in the case of london uefa  certainly in many european airports such measures also apply in the case of international travel while the most of these extreme measures can be effective it is believed that they can also be abusive and seriously harmful to the tourismwith the reduction in airport revenues caused by the decrease in passenger movement some airports have directed their activities to the air cargo as in the case of the london heathrow airport lhr which despite identifying a reduction close to  in the number of passengers expects a growth in the next years above  in the number of cargoonly flights lhr thus there is a need for strategic planning and management of technological innovations dodgson gann salter  with the development of new technologies products services and processes in different areas of airport innovation caetano alves alves  which make the sector immune to this and other similar diseases that will certainly emerge as new challenges to be faced in the futurein addition to the proposals already identified in the literature and practice it propose a framework which can contribute to airport managers in establishing procedures that can collaborate both in maintaining the safety of passengers visiting and airport employees as well as in tourism productivity from a better planning of innovations in airports for pandemic situationsdifferent moments from the strategic planning of the airport to the presence of the passenger in the departure lounge are considered here remembering that the main objective in this proposal is not to limit access to air transport or tourist destinations but rather to provide travel conditions for different situations presented by passengersthe measures proposed are considered at three different organizational management levels of the airports the strategic tactical and operational anthony  as shown in figure according to figure  each of the three organizational management levels has measures that must be adopted at airports such as the review of the business model and the future planning of the airport at the strategic level the definition and collection of indicators considered in the actions of medium term at the tactical level and also the immediate processes carried out at the airport at the operational level considered here only the processing of passengers different measures are proposed for each of these three organizational management levelsbusiness model review which should be revised considering also situations of pandemics and disease transmissions such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  sarscov not only as an emergency demand for decisionmaking but as a permanent element in the guidelines for the businessestablishment of a technological intelligence center in order to identify develop and implement new solutions in partnership with different research institutions as well as technologybased companiesdevelopment and constant review of technology roadmapping trm phaal farrukh probert  for new products processes and services to be developed in partnerships with different collaborating and cooperators partners caetano amaral  such as airlines aeronautics industry passengers and suppliersair freight planning at the airport taking advantage of the significant growth in the sector obtained with the pandemic as identified in figure  iata b in order to obtain additional revenue for the business this measure can be planned based on the involvement of different players in intermodal cargo distribution as well as adopting concepts of innovation applied to air cargo transport niine kolbre miina according to figure  it can be noted that air cargo transport significantly improved its productivity in terms of aircraft occupancy load factor and in the yields of transported cargo even considering the smaller number of passenger aircraft flying commonly used also for the transportation of cargodefinition of cooperation agreements between the airport and government agencies in order to obtain financial aid in obtaining basic items of personal hygiene and protection such as disinfectants and individual masks as this is a matter of public health as well as availability of public health datainvestment in general aviation in such a way that this significant market is better explored especially at airports with less traffic considering the brazilian case there are  registered aircraft in the country belonging to general aviation which are mainly distributed in the categories of conventional fixed wing  or  rotary wing or helicopters  or  and others including amphibians  not counting the  domestic or international regular commercial aviation aircraft nor the  experimental aircraft identified in  abag  anac  gama identification and monitoring of the airport innovation index based on operational data or surveys with passengers and airport employees for this the proposal presented by caetano alves and alves  can be used to identify priority areas for airport innovation in passengers and luggage processing information communication and passenger services runway courtyard and physical elements of the airport and airport businessdevelopment of an intelligence data analysis on travel restrictions and obligations imposed by different tourist destinations such as vaccination certificates in addition to analyzing consumer behavior in order to identify the demands and priorities of passengers based on their different perceptions of pandemic risks during their travels graham kremarik kruse  thus in addition to meeting the imposed requirements it is also possible to minimize the negative psychological effects of the pandemic on the traveler making it clear that airports and aircraft are safe placesdefinition of a passenger classification index pci based on the crossing of profile data obtained from public health and socioeconomic agencies social networks and declarations issued by the passenger during the air ticket booking for this machine learning resources can be used as proposed by rodrguezsanz et al  in the sense of identifying passengers who may present risks to the processes such as contaminated passengers or else being exposed to possible identified risks such as unvaccinated figure  presents a possible scheme for the flow of data collection and treatment in this classificationas proposed in figure  at the time the airline ticket is reversed a series of data about the passenger such as origin country of residence health data as well as other data provided by government health agencies in addition to other direct information requested at the booking added to the destination to be visited such as travel restrictions and vaccination requirements for example it is analyzed using algorithms generated by artificial intelligence ai with the use of ai it is possible to analyze and combine data from passenger and tourist destinations profiles in real time iansiti lakhani  enabling decisionmaking by air transport operators for the pci different classification criteria c and their respective calculated weights w are then mathematically analyzed for the passenger x as presented in equation  from algorithms which can be engineered by machine learning techniques the result of this analysis in case of approval is then forwarded to the purchase and together with the ticket which can only be a code accessible by electronic device a travel certificate is generated which can be updated or validated moments before the trip otherwise to the passengers is recommended to adopt certain measures that can meet both the obligations imposed by the airport and the tourist destination such as for example the constant use of certain personal protective equipment such as a highperformance surgical maskit should be noted here that the main function of this travel certificate is not to prevent the passenger from traveling nor to subject him to embarrassing situations but rather to offer him differentiated treatment conditions that are in agreement with his conditions and possibilitiesair freight infrastructure optimization as a source of additional revenue for airports simplifying access and obtaining economies of scale when possiblegeneral aviation stimulus such as the availability of spaces reserved for executive aviation passengers reduced rates for landing takeoff and aircraft stay fees individualized processing of passengers and luggage among other promotionshealth screening with the measurement of peoples temperature by thermographic cameras in the moments immediately prior to entering the passenger terminal in addition to the tests already commonly used at airports such as blood sampling polymerase chain reaction pcr antigen tests among others new tests in development cheaper and with faster results oliveira et al  silva et al  can be used on arrival or on the flight to people through airports such information is useful so that it is possible to take better decisions regarding this individual in the next operational activities such as their destination for a suitable environment within the terminalcarrying out constant preventive actions since the arrival of passengers visitors or employees at the airport such as hand and shoe hygiene touchless doors maintenance of social distance selfservices in addition to the provision of selfcleaning totems whose touchable surfaces are coated with nanotechnology that enable the reduction in their retention of particles figure  presents a scheme with some of the main operational recommendationsaccording to figure  in addition to the solutions already commonly used in airports such as doors with automatic opening other simple measures can be adopted in areas of identification health screening and sanitation in yellow in figure  as well as the readjustment infrastructure in the passenger terminal so that a wide range of services can be provided to people who meet or who do not the established health criteriacombine pci and the airport feature and destination restrictions in defining the best ways to serve passengers during their travel journey such as the offer of specific services and provision of reserved space for those passengers who for example for personal reasons or health restrictions do not have a valid vaccination certificateairport ground handling automation not only in order to meet the growth of future demands in the sector tabares moracamino drouin  but also in order to reduce baggage handling by operators and spread of contaminants between different luggageuse of artificial intelligence ai and smart services in the identification of passengers based on biometric patterns as shown in figure  to release access to different areas of the airport or even guide the passenger x to his boarding gate smart services to trigger alerts to managers in case of agglomerations above established levels or intensification of air filtration and robots for cleaning areas with greater occupancy automated kiosks that can move to areas with greater security for checking in as well as other smart services through which there may be less dependence on human contact in passenger processing throughout the airport terminalprovision of efficient masks for passengers visiting and airport employees as the surgical or n masks which according to cheng et al  significantly reduce the emission of particles into the environment during peoples breathing such considerations can be identified in figure a with the schematic illustration of different regimes of abundance of respiratory particles and viruses and in figure b demonstrating the volume size distributions of respiratory particles emitted during different respiratory activities with and without masksaccording to figures a and b it is noted that environments with low virus abundance viruslimited regime the masks considered are effective in propagating the virus however even if the use of masks significantly reduces the distribution of particles in environments with high virus abundance virusrich regime the use of masks should be combined with other preventive measures such as the constant exchange of ambient air and social distancing cheng et al  obviously such measures must be combined with the constant maintenance of air conditioning equipment inside airportsadded to the described concerns in airport management to contain the spread of the disease during the passengers journey across the airport there is also the need to maintain the support of the business with demand reductions such as rethinking financial decisions by reducing operational expenditure as well as the search for strategies to increase revenues through for example the concessions of spaces destined to nonaeronautical activities the search for financial support from governments or optimization effort for the repositioning of available infrastructure must also be considered as due to social distancing larger spaces per passenger must be made available at different times during their stay at the airport during checkin lounge waiting or boarding queue for example serrano kazda it is believed that such recommendations and constant updates and revisions to procedures can make airports immune and safer from the spread of respiratory diseases in addition such measures allow that instead of creating barriers for travelers who do not meet the sanitary conditions imposed by the different tourist destinations there is a mitigation of their impacts and that passenger can be reincluded in air transport without prejudice or treatment inhuman under such circumstancescertainly such measures require additional efforts such as the involvement of different airport stakeholders in these decisions as well as the review of airport planning manuals that address the level of service and necessary infrastructure made available by institutions such as iata and icaoin addition in a complex organizational environment such as the airport there is also a need to constantly maintain a culture of innovation in all its organizational management instances from strategic to operational with collaboration between all stakeholders as it is about interests not only of the airport managers but of the entire tourism chain including from the service providers in the emitting poles to the facilities in tourist destinations and the tourist itself being one of the main responsible for the effective immunization of tourism the review of strategies to face this pandemic and future ones must be carried out constantly in order to avoid even greater damages in the future both in relation to negative socioeconomic impacts and on the physical and mental health of

Research paper_Journal article,URRUM_2.docx,Research paper_Journal article,URRUM_2.docx,despite the extraordinary impact of information and communication technologies icts on the chinese economy there exists no systematic information on ict investment in chinese official statistics we make the first attempt to estimate such investment using chinas total investment in equipment by industry controlled by chinas national accounts constructed by the cip china industrial productivity project and the relationship between ict equipment investment and ict service intermediate input observed in the japanese economy we show that over the entire period  chinas investment in ict equipment grew by  percent per annum which was about two folds of that of nonict equipment the share of ict investment in chinas nominal gdp peaked in  at around  percent yet declined to about  percent in the recent years similarly the ict investment share in nominal gfcf peaked in  at around  percent and then declined to about  percent in  largely attributable to the governments unprecedented investment in infrastructures to sustain growth by  chinas ict intensity measured as the share of ict equipment in total equipment stock had reached  percent about  percent that of japan   and  percent that of the us   in sectoral comparisons we show that chinas service sector is moreict intensive  than its industrial sector  a similar pattern to but a narrower spread than that of japan  vs   and the us  vs  keywords information and communication technologies icts ict investment ict capital stock inputoutput tablesthe exponential efficiency improvement of information and communication technologies icts as predicted by moores law and the precipitous decline of prices of ict equipment have greatly benefited the growth of developing economies like china that is not only ambitiously open to new technologies but facilitated by government industrial policies that have resulted in a fast expansion of manufacturing capacities on the other side of the coin chinas entry to ict manufacturing from the lower end of the technology and then gradually moved up along the global value chains of icts must have also significantly facilitated the worlds ict advancement eg chinas comparative advantage in the mass production of standard yet cheap ict parts and in turn furthered chinas growth the logic of such an understanding of the role of icts in chinas growth has nonetheless not been empirically examined with official statistics that allow any direct measures of inputs and outputs of ict manufacturers and productive users from the output or the valueadded of the ictrelated industries chinas growth performance has been indeed impressive as showed by the latest global manufacturing data from unido united nations industrial and development organization by  china had overtaken the us as the world largest manufacturer of ict products parts and equipment chinas growth is first assessed from am ict perspective by wu and liang  in a jorgensonian industryorigin growth accounting framework notwithstanding the absence of a direct measure of ict assets they identified chinese ictproducing and using industries based on observations of the us economy as documented in jorgenson  and jorgenson et al  despite their high appraisal about the role of the sodefined ict industries in chinas growth and productivity performance they were unable to acknowledge or measure the contribution of the services of ict capital stock to the growth without a proper estimation of ict investment by industry the significance of ict capital in the growth and productivity performance has been well established in the literature in one of pioneer studies that account for the role of ict in advanced economies jorgenson  shows that the growth of ict capital services in the us jumped from  percent per annum over the period  to  percent over the period  which was in a sharp contrast to the growth of nonict capital services increasing merely from  to  percent particularly over the period  ict products both equipment and software contributed  percentage points ppts out of percent annual tfp growth accounting for nearly  percent of the aggregate tfp despite it only accounted for  percent of the us percent annual gdp growth in the case of europe omahony and van ark  show that for  european union member states during the period  ictproducing industries enjoyed a labor productivity growth of  percent per annum much faster than that of the total economy of  percent per annum focusing on ict investment and economic growth in nine oecd countries colecchia and schreyer  also find that along with a significant decline in the prices of ict capital goods over the period  all these countries experienced a remarkable increase in the rate of investment in ict equipment on average ict capital contributed between  and  ppts to annual economic growth that ranged from  to  percent per annum particularly for the second half of the s this rose to  to  ppts per year out of  to percent annual output growth in a comparative study between japan and south korea fukao et al  also find that the growth of ict investment in the two economies was phenomenal during the period  by  and  percent per annum respectively however it concludes that aggregate tfp appears to be more attributable to ictproducing industries than to ictusing industries for both japan and korea in a recent study from fukao kim and kwon  using the jip and eu klems database a comparison of the ict capital input between the us and japan is conducted unexpectedly the study finds that the us is not necessarily more ictintensive in its production activities than japan during the period  moreover for both countries the ict intensity which is defined as the ict capital service share in total capital service is higher in nonmanufacturing sector than that in manufacturing sector in terms of intermediate ict service share in value added japan is nearly twice as high as that in the us for finance wholesale and retail sectors the authors suggest that this could be attributable to the higher ict asset and service price in japan as for the growth rate of ict capital stock it is faster than that of total capital stock for both countries however it is slower for japan than that for the us however lack of statistics on ict investment at industry level has prevented us from directly identifying and measuring individual chinese industries with a specific role and a level of importance in ict  this paper is a preliminary attempt to construct the ict tangible assets computer and communication equipment in chinas capital stock the study reported in this paper is heavily datadriven and measurementoriented first we estimate chinas ict investment flows at the macrolevel through a cipchina klems reconstructed inputoutput accounts in time series then the industrylevel distribution of ict investment spending is gauged based on the econometric approach to explore relationships between the change of ict intensity and the change of intermediate input from the ict service producers using the detailed industrylevel japan industrial productivity jip database  the rest of the paper is organized as follows section  explains how annual ict investment flows are constructed for the aggregate economy and detailed industry level respectively and introduces the integration with cip capital account section  summarizes our estimates of prices of ict assets and net ict capital stock by industry through the perpetual inventory method section  presents the estimated results and a comparison with the us and japan finally section  concludes the paper with future research prioritiessince there is no ict equipment investment data reported in the chinese official statistics we need to estimate them using available information from various sources and indirect approach this section presents the methodology used to estimate the flows of ict equipment for the aggregate chinese economy and in each industry from  to  first unlike the other economies in which data on ict investment from national statistical offices are available we estimate the investment in information technology it and communication technology ct equipment separately for the aggregate economy which is consistent with the data in national accounts commodity flow method is the usually preferred approach to derive the annual ict investment series in case that the official statistics are unavailable ark where  is the current gross fixed capital formation gfcf of ictproducing industries in year   is gross domestic output  imports and  exports superscript  refers to inputoutput tables and  the benchmark year for io table all other variables without superscript  are timeseries data obtained from the national accounts       this supply side method traces specific commodities from their domestic production and imports to their final demand with exports excluded more precisely commoditybased supply and use tables suts combined with production import and export data for ict equipment could serve our purpose the suts show the domestic production from which exports have to be excluded and imports destined to investment while doing this we exclude the ict goods for household consumption use we identify two manufacturing industries as ict equipment producers in cip industry classification electronic and telecommunication equipment cip code  and instruments and office equipment cip which are in line with the isic revision  sector number   and  in cip timeseries suts the gfcf of these two ict commodities office machinery and computers as it equipment radio television and communication equipment as ct equipment from two ict manufacturing producers are used to estimate the ict equipment investment for the aggregate economy       to estimate the industrylevel ict investment is a more challenging work for us as no statistics on ict investment at the detailed industry level are directly available therefore the strategy we adopt to indirectly estimate the industry distribution of ict investment is exploring the relationship between ict investment and the relevant variables using the econometric approach io tables could provide us the linkages across the industries particularly the intermediate matrix which highlights the interindustrial relationships covering all sectors in the economy given the data availability we could access to the timeseries io tables and detailed industrylevel ict investment statistics for japan from jip database and also timeseries io tables for china from cip database      the basic idea of the empirical strategy is to explore the relationship between the ict equipment investment and intermediate ict service using jip database then we apply the estimated coefficients of intermediate ict service to chinese data to predict the industry distribution of ict equipment investment in the case of china one could observe from the io tables that the majority of industries receive the intermediate input from the ictproducing service sector which includes the hardware and software consultancy maintenance of computing equipment data processing and telecommunication services according to the sna and oecd  only if a purchase has a useful life of more than one year the expenditure on assets will be capitalized however this does not account for all ict investment for instance a firm purchasing software with oneyear licenses will be recorded as intermediate consumption in general these intermediate ict services need to be delivered during the production activities through the ict equipment hence industrylevel ict hardware investment should be responsive to the change of intermediate ict servicein order to estimate the industry distribution of ict investment first of all we investigate how ict equipment investment intensity responds to the change of intermediate ict service intensity the panel data regression model is set as followswhere the dependent variable is  the deviation from the mean of ict hardware investment intensity for industry  at year  the main independent variable is  the deviation from the mean of intermediate ict service intensity for industry  at year  and other control variables including time trend  and its quadratic term  and the industry dummy variable  that is for controlling industry fixed effects and thus will enable us to control for industryspecific characteristics and avoid some criticism on omitted variables finally  is the error term       some may argue that it is better to estimate ict investment function however some key variables such as ict capital stock the user cost and spillover effect of ict assets and rd capital stock are required to estimate the ict investment function like what miyagawa and hamagata  did in their study first due to the data availability we could not obtain these key independent variables in such an estimation and obviously let alone ict capital stock data for estimating user cost of ict assets then the different purposes also make us leave this estimation strategy to the future research to draw policy implications for ict investment        the data used to estimate the coefficients in the above regression model come from the jip database  which is compiled by the rieti asian industrial productivity program and the ier of hitotsubashi university this data set covers  industries for the whole japanese economy from  to  and provides timeseries io tables and data on ict assets from this data set we chose data on  industries over the period  telegraph and telephone jip code  and information services and internetbased services jip  are distinguished from the jip industry classification as ct and itproducing services respectively which produce intermediate ict services to other sectors furthermore according to assets concordance between jip and eu klems see table a for details we identify the general equipment no  and  asset types in jip investment matrix as it equipment and no  and  asset types as ct equipment        ict hardware investment intensity  is defined as the investment share of ict equipment in the total equipment of industry  at year  and is measured as the deviation from the mean of the aggregate economy of this intensity which means that it equals to one for industries having the same intensity with that of the aggregate economy and is greater or less than one for industries having higher or lower intensity than that of the aggregate economy since the it and ct equipment have significant differences in price and depreciation process we adopt a strategy to estimate them separately three variables   and  are constructed to measure the ict it and ct intensity of each industrywhere the variables   and  are the investment in ict it and ct equipment and the variable  is the investment in total equipment of industry  at year       similarly intermediate ict service intensity  is defined as the share of intermediate ict service in the total intermediate input of industry  at year  and is measured as the deviation from the mean of the aggregate economy of this intensity also three variables   and  are constructed to measure the intermediate ict it and ct service intensity of each industrywhere the variables   and  are the intermediate ict it and ct service and the variable  is the total intermediate input of industry  at year table  shows the descriptive statistics for the main variables       table  presents the regression results with ict hardware investment intensity as well as the separate it and ct hardware investment intensity as the dependent variables and industry fixed effects included from the column  to  the dependent variable is the ict hardware investment intensity in the first column it is the result that we run the regression of this dependent variable on intermediate ict service intensity unfortunately the coefficient of this intermediate ict service intensity is insignificant and has a negative sign which is inconsistent with our hypothesis this result suggests that the mix of intermediate it and ct services would not account for the variability in the dependent variable which is probably due to the distinctive capital accumulation patterns caused by their different prices and depreciation rates of it and ct equipment therefore we decide to explore the effect of intermediate it and ct service intensity on the dependent variable respectively       column  of table  reports the result with only intermediate it service intensity as the independent variable and the same independent variable ict investment intensity the coefficient of the intermediate it service intensity is  which is significant at the  percent level next if we add the intermediate ct service intensity into the model as another dependent variable the result of column  is obtained the coefficient of intermediate it service intensity is still significantly positive and quite stable but the coefficient for the intermediate ct service intensity is only significant at  percent level and negative thus this result does support our viewpoint that it equipment may be more responsive to the change of it service due to its rapid price decline and have a high replacement rate due to its relatively higher depreciation rate than that of other machineries whereas ct equipment is relatively abundant in japan and less responsive to the change of ct service because of its slower price decline and depreciation rate        finally we investigate it and ct investment intensity as the dependent variable separately  column  and  of table  present the results for models with it investment intensity as the dependent variable the coefficient for intermediate it service intensity is significant and positive in model  when intermediate ct service intensity is added in the coefficient for intermediate it service is still stable but the coefficient of intermediate ct service is not significant similarly if we examine the case of only ct investment intensity as the dependent variable column  and  show the insignificant results for intermediate ct service intensity        in order to achieve our goal we adopt the coefficients of intermediate it service intensity in model  and  in which both ict investment intensity and it investment intensity have a good response to the change of intermediate it service the different magnitudes of the coefficients of intermediate it service intensity in these two models may indicate the impact on the change of ct investment therefore we first apply the estimated two coefficients to the intermediate it service intensity in chinese data to predict the corresponding ict investment intensity and it investment intensity for chinese economy then to obtain the ct investment intensity from the difference of the predicted ict and it investment intensity         it is noteworthy that our estimation approach implicitly presumes that the response of ict investment to the change of intermediate ict service for each industry is similar between china and japan however we have our own intermediate ict service intensity at the industry level and the ict investment intensity at the aggregate level for china which to some extent could control for the differences between two countries         to estimate the industry distribution of ict investment for china the estimated coefficients  and industry effects  from the above regression models using the jip database are applied to the intermediate it service intensity for china the general coefficient  of the intercept term is used when the estimated industry effect is not significant before doing this  industries in jip database are merged into broader  sectors that could be mapped into the industry classification of cip database see table a for details by using the nominal share of intermediate it service of each component industry in this broader sector as weight we aggregate the industry effects of component industries for one broader sector the adjusted coefficients of industry effects for  broader sectors and for two models ict intensity model  and it intensity model  are reported in table a         finally after applying the estimated coefficients to the intermediate it service intensity for each industry in cip database we could obtain the ict investment intensity and it investment intensity which both are measured as the deviation from the mean of the aggregate economy defined as eq a and b then these two obtained intensities are multiplied by the ict investment share in total equipment investment  and by the it investment share in total equipment investment  of the aggregate economy respectively we get the ict investment share in total equipment investment    and it investment share in total equipment investment  for each industry  eventually by multiplying the industrylevel total equipment investment from cip database we can derive the it and ct investment at the industry level for china         the estimated ict investment for the aggregate economy from the commodity flow method is taken as the control total we calculate the industry structure of ict investment using the predicted results from the regression and then redistribute this control total to get our ultimately estimated industrylevel ict investment furthermore in order to match  industries in cip database we split the broader sector by the nominal investment share in total equipment of each component industry         before the construction of ict capital stock described in the next section the estimated ict investment need to be integrated with the capital account in cip database we take the investment in total equipment from cip as the control total and split it into ict and nonict equipment investment the nonict equipment capital stock is constructed following the procedures documented in wu         capital stock estimates can be derived either using data based on a direct measurement of the stock or using investment data and the perpetual inventory method however the official statistics on the direct measurement of ict capital stock is not available in china thus the perpetual inventory method is adopted to generate the ict capital stockthe perpetual inventory method pim of estimating capital stock has been developed since goldsmith  following hulten  we can start by assuming that not the amount of capital stock itself  but the quantity of new capital added to the stock via investment in each year  can be observed the problem is to develop a reasonable procedure for adding up the investment  into an estimate of capital stock  recognizing that part or all of past additions to the stock may have been retired from service and that the services obtained from older capital may be less productive       the perpetual inventory method is one attempt at solving this problem when the perpetual inventory method is adopted to transform data on ict investment quantities into estimates of the quantity of ict capital stock two key assumptions are required here the first is the ageefficiency profile which shows the relative productivity of ict capital at different ages and is defined by a constant geometric rate the second assumption is that all ict investment is measured in constant quality efficiency units which allows investment of different vintages to be treated as perfect substitutes in production together these two assumptions imply that the perpetual inventory method can be expressed aswhere  is the stock at the end of period  and the efficiency of an asset is assumed to decline geometrically with age at the rate  note that the rates of decline in efficiency  are indexed only by asset  which means that they are constant over time and that there are no differences in asset composition across industries finally because all capital is measured in baseyear efficiency units the appropriate price for valuing the ict capital stock in all years is the economywide investment price deflator for ict assets       thus in order to be able to apply the perpetual inventory method to measure the ict capital stock we need a time series of ict investment flow at constant price information on the depreciation rates of the ict assets and information on the initial ict capital stock at the time when the investment time series starts next we present this process for constructing chinas ict capital stock for the period since the perpetual inventory method requires the investment flows expressed in constant quality efficiency units ict price deflators are required to convert investment data in nominal prices into a constantprice basis in the case of ict goods the embodied technical change is fast and its price declines rapidly it is crucial to distinguish the true price change from the price change due to quality change in obtaining volume terms of ict assets therefore a constant quality price index is required for deflating ict investment in the nominal term the hedonic approach is used by a number of countries to estimate ict price index which would establish a systematic relationship between price and characteristics of computer models as for china the hedonic method is unavailable due to data constraints for the time being meanwhile the conventional producer price index of ict manufacturing industry mixed with other nonict assets is obviously understate true price change of ict assets thus the measured rate of volume investment growth will be slower under the producer price index than under the hedonic price index hence we consider the us ict deflators which are estimated based on the hedonic approachif we directly use the us ict deflators the underlying hypothesis is that nominal prices of ict products change at the same rate with that of china this simple transposition assumes no differences in the composition of ict production or consumption as well as no differences in market structure and competition also this assumes away that different countries may experience different changes in overall price leveltherefore we construct the harmonized ict deflators schreyer  in order to control for domestic inflation the following assumption is made the relative price change of the ict product should be the same across countries to be specific we assume the relative price change of ict and nonict capital goods in china should be the same with that in the us which is given bywhere  is the growth rate of ict products price in china  is the growth rate of nonict products price in china and the rest two terms are the growth rates of ict and nonict products prices for the us the ict deflators of us and the harmonized ict deflators of china is depicted as follow        as shown in figure  we can see a rapid price decline for it products which provides powerful economic incentives for the diffusion of information technology jorgenson ho and stiroh  found that the substantial acceleration in the it price decline triggered a burst of it investment which had become the foundation for the resurgence of the american economy since the mid of s although not falling as fast as it price ct price has also been falling since the s for the us in a sharp contrast to the rise in nonict price adjusted for the domestic inflation this similar pattern also could be observed in the estimated ict prices for chinafor depreciation rates due to lack of the survey data on service lives of ict assets for china we assume the same service lives with that of the us and thus adopt the bea bureau of economic analysis depreciation rates  percent for it equipment and  percent for ct equipment  the estimation of the initial ict capital stock follows the steadystate method as in king and levine  let us assume that physical capital stock and the real output grow at the same rate  that iswhere  is the ict capital stock and is real gdp at time  since  then  where  is gross ict investment and  is the depreciation rate for asset type  hence the initial ict capital stock could be derived as followsto solve for  of eq  we have already obtained ict investment flows in  which can be used for  and depreciation rates  are  percent and  percent for it and ct equipment respectively for the initialperiod gdp growth rate    in order to avoid the fluctuation of gdp growth the average growth rate for the period  of each industry is adopted   this section presents and discusses our estimates of ict assets for the chinese economy over the period  it is difficult to make a reasonable or acceptable assessment of such a data work when the primary information is missing in this regard it is important to benchmark our estimates on policy regime changes in the domestic economy that are deemed to influence investment decisions and on proper international references though subject to strong assumptions in what follows we first report and assess the estimates for ict and nonict investment and then report and discuss the estimates for ict and nonict capital stock by asset type and by ictspecific industry groups respectively finally we compare the key indicators with those of the us and japan for its two major sectors industrial and service where compatible data are availableserving as a useful background let us start with an examination of the dynamism of chinas ict investment over the past four decades figure  demonstrates changes of chinas investment in ict versus nonict equipment while figure  shows changes of chinas investment in ictintensive versus nonictintensive industries measured in the real annual growth rate the left panel and in the leveleffect of the real growth based on the estimate for  the right panelfrom figure  we can see a more rapid growth in the investment in ict equipment compared to that of nonit equipment which resulted in a quick catch up of the former with the latter since the early s in the wake of chinas entrance to wto these two investments had followed a similar growth trend quickly as shown in the right panel of figure  interestingly from an industry perspective in figure  despite a seemingly more volatile behavior the faster growth of ict investment did not induce a faster expansion of industries that produced ict equipment or use ict intensively compared to nonictintensive industries particularly after the mids this observation may suggest that chinas catch up through icts notably the mature part of icts was somewhat balanced across all industries following a more marketoriented reforms in the mids when the communist government adopted a socialist market model to better understand such an investment dynamism it is better to examine changes in chinas investment in nominal terms because investments were motivated by relative costs between asset types of different industries figure  the left panel shows chinas investment in it and ct equipment in comparison with that in nonict assets in current yuan denoted value it further confirms that chinas significant increase in ict investment began in the s with the adoption of the socialist market model by our estimation in  it amounted to  billion yuan compared to  billion yuan in  it is worth noting that the ict investment surge in the s was led by ct equipment rather than it equipment although the it catch up starting in the end of the s experienced an even faster pace the right panel it may be therefore conjectured that the more consumer marketoriented ct development such as mobile phones played a key role in motivating the more producer marketoriented it investment this considers the nature of the ictled revolution that significantly increases market uncertainty hence driving intense competition because of the moorespeed technical advancement and decline of ict equipment prices as the same time yet one may be puzzled why had the it investment lost steam since the early s whereas investment in other assets especially nonict remained robustthis puzzling observation may be better seen with a background of policy regime shifts considering that the rapid decline of ict prices has significantly changed the relative costs between investments in different assets across industries in table  we examine chinas investment structure by asset type and by ictspecific industry in nominal terms over seven subperiods that are characterized by different reforms or macroeconomic conditions in general despite several rounds of promarket reforms government interventions in investment have remained strong in upstream industries such as energy and important capital goods like heavy input materials that are considered strategically imperative to the national economy or the state interests while leaving those industries close to the end market less controlled hence subject to more market competitions wu  however macroeconomic policies to accelerate or to sustain the growth have had an important bearing on investment figure  derived from table  further helps our exploration of the policy or institutional effect upon the ict investment and the change of the it and ct patterns  from the left panel of figure  we could see that the ict share in the total investment or gfcf significantly speeded up in the wake of chinas adoption of the socialist market model in  and deepening soe reforms in  the right panel of the figure reveals that the  ict investment surge was attributable to ct but the  further rise was mainly caused by a quick catch up of it implying that the earlier market expansion for ct investment now began attracting it investment in production although the total ict share in gfcf appears to have remained no change in  albeit chinas assess to wto the left panel there was a substantial shift from ct to it within the ict investment the right panel in which not only did the government industrial policy aiming at technological advancement play a key role but it was also enhanced by local governments competing for faster growth this shift continued nonetheless in the early post global financial crisis period  these noteworthy changes were accompanied by a rapid growth of investment in infrastructural construction and dwellings as the results of the central governments postcrisis growthsustaining policy the left panel in the late postcrisis period  when the rising costs and enduring structural problems further reduced the room for macroeconomic policies to manipulate thus refraining government interventions the investment in ct resurged the right panel evidenced by the rapid expansion of mobile phones since  following the emergence of chinese smartphone brands such as huawei xiaomi oppo and vivobesides the above policybased interpretation of the ict estimates it is helpful to quantify the factors that might have caused the distinct rise in the ict share of gdp over the period  and the distinct decline of the share over the period  as shown in table  we use a shift share technique as expressed in eq  to examine whether the slowdown in the growth rate of this share for chinese economy is due to a shrinkage in the proportion of industry with higher growth rate of this share the slowdown of the growth rate of ict investment share in gdp for the aggregate economy or manufacturing sector or service sector or other sectors could be decomposed into the following two effects where  and are average share of industry gdp in aggregate gdp for the period  and  respectively  and  are annualaverage growth rate of the ict investment share in gdp for two periods        the first term of righthand side of the above equation is the within industry effect which explains that the slowdown of the growth rate of the share for aggregate economy stems from the slowdown at the industry level on the other hand the second term reflects the structural change effect which implies a shrinkage in the proportion of industry with a relatively higher growth rate of the sharetable  shows the decomposition result for the slowdown of the growth rate of ict investment share in gdp from the period  to  for the aggregate economy the structural change effect is  percent indicating that changes of the weights of component industries influence lowering the growth rate of ict investment share in gdp however this negative effect of the structural change is only  ppts which is quite small compared with the slowdown for the macroeconomy from the period  to in terms of the results for sectors they present different patterns as for manufacturing sector the shrinkage in the proportion of industry with a higher growth rate reduces the growth rate of the ict investment share in gdp in contrast service sector has a positive structural change effect which raises the growth rate of the share albeit a very small effect  ppts but this implies that in service sector the proportion of industry with higher growth rate of ict investment is expanding in the case of other sector the growth rate of ict investment share in gdp is accelerating which is mainly attributable to the within industry effect in summary these results suggest that the slowdown of the growth rate of ict investment share in gdp since  is not primarily caused by the structural change effect but mostly resulted from the slowdown occurred in manufacturing and service sector as discussed earlier this decomposition supports our view that the decline in ict investment is associated with the expansion of the real estate sector after chinas wto entry and unprecedented infrastructure investment in the wake of global financial crisis in table  we report the estimated ict and nonict capital stock for the chinese economy for the entire period and its subperiods that are considered significant policy regime shifts the stock estimates are in the real and net terms obtained by the standard perpetual inventory method pim as expressed in eq  additionally in table  we show the asset structure of the capital stock in constant  prices for an examination of structural changes in the capital stock over the whole period and its subperiods  based on the stock estimates in figure  we depict indices for all the major assets and for ict assets respectively benchmarked on  the time when china was granted with a wto membership we use logarithmic scale to better examine likely shifts of the underlying trends turns and shocks which may help explore the institutional or policy impact on the buildup of chinas capital stock especially on changes between ict and nonict capital stock and between it and ct within the ict capital stock the features of our ictspecific capital stock estimates can be summarized in three points as follows firstly chinas ict capital stock grew more rapidly than nonict capital stock through several important accelerations over the period in question from the left panel of figure  we see that chinas ict capital stock began accelerating in the mids as china kicked out its industrial reform it appears that allowing the market to play a role at the margin ie in addition to the planning assignment under the dualtrack price scheme stimulated the growth of ict capital stock the growth was obstructed by the tiananmen shock in  but accelerated again at an even faster pace from  following dengs call for bolder reforms the postwto entry period nonetheless did not see a further surge but a somewhat return to its underlying trend of the s before a global financial crisisinduced slowdown in the s secondly as shown in the right panel of figure  the growth of ct capital stock appears to be less volatile than that of it capital stock and much steadier despite the shock of the crisis this suggests that the slight slowdown of the total ict stock after s as shown in the left panel was largely attributable to the slowdown of it rather than ct such different performances between it and ct appear to be consistent with our conjecture that compared to the consumer marketoriented ct investment the producer marketoriented it investment is more exposed to government interventions and industrial policies hence more influenced by radical policy changes this can be substantiated by the postcrisis shift of the ict capital stock growth from the industrial sector to the service sector and the greater concentration on ct table  thirdly despite external shocks and radical policy regime shifts the growth of nonresidential structures mainly influenced by the governments persistent investment in infrastructures to sustain growth was rather steady throughout the entire period it should be emphasized that by separating the ict capital stock from the nonict capital stock as well as dwellings from other structures the governments objective of using infrastructural investment as a policy instrument becomes much clearer for a good example observable in the left panel of figure  the late postcrisis period  saw that when the growth of all other capital assets slowed down except for the ct stock the growth of nonresidential structures remained strong or strongly pathdependent table  and its share in the total capital stock for the first time since the mids reached  percent table given data deficiencies it is challenging to compare our estimates for china with other economies especially in the case ict capital stock it is difficult to control the stage of development with per capita gdp as a yardstick because the superfast ict advancement and meanwhile price decline especially since the s make it hardly to have countries with compatible conditions in history however the nature of ict development suggests that such a consideration may be unnecessary because huge uncertainties and hence fierce competitions that are caused by unprecedentedly rapid changes in technologies and prices make any administrative controls over ict transfer more costly and therefore market integration across countries easier even so one must bear in mind that chinas ict economy concentrates more on those industries using largely lowtomediumrange mature technologies whereas the more advanced economies such as the us and japan that are to be compared in what follows focus mainly on highrange technologies and innovations to assess our estimated ict capital stock for the chinese economy with the us and japan as a benchmark we use an indicator of ict intensity measured by the share of ict equipment in the total equipment we conduct the comparison for the industrial sector and the service sector separately as presented in the two panels of figure  in the case of the industrial sector despite a much lower starting level in the s chinas ict intensity exceeded that of the us in the late s and japan in the early s china reached its peak of  percent in  a level that was surprisingly about  and  percent higher than that of the us in  and japan in  respectively china maintained the highest ict intensity of the three economies even after a sharp decline in the recent decade such a decline is difficult to explain considering the nature of the ict development as discussed earlier and the trend of the us in particular other things being equal one may argue that chinese ict industries like nonict industries of the industrial sector might have also suffered from a severe surpluscapacity problem although our earlier work shows that the former is more productive than the latter wu and liang in the case of the service sector shown in the right panel of figure  all the three economies generally have a higher ict intensity than that of the manufacturing sector of the three economies japan demonstrated the highest ict intensity ranged from  percent in  to  percent in  however for a comparable period from the mids the us was about  percentage points below japan but exhibited a less volatile dynamism than japan chinas service sector like its industrial sector had a fairly low ict intensity before a sudden surge in the early s chinas pace of catch up in the following decade was nothing but extraordinary exceeding the us in  and reaching japan in  however the year  also marked the beginning of chinas abrupt downturn and there was not a sign of reversal by the end of the period of our comparison in our view any market mechanismbased opinion without a careful investigation of the underlying institutional problems may only provide a misleading conclusion based on our earlier work chinese ictintensive industries in services were largely monopolized by the central governmentcontrolled soes and less efficient than their counterparts in manufacturing wu and liang        in the era of ictleading growth and productivity enhancement any growth analysis especially for an economy like that of china in terms of its very size and pace of expansion is by no means sufficient without explicitly accounting for the role of ict capital assets and the role of the industries making and intensively using icts yet the missing of the primary and systematic information for ict activities in official statistics has been a major obstacle to such an analysis this study has made the first ever attempt to fill this gap by following the standard capital theory in a national account frameworkbased on the reconstructed time series inputoutput accounts in the cipchina klems database we first estimate macrolevel it and ct investment flows and distribute the aggregate flows across  chinese industries economy wide by an econometric approach that explores the relationship between the level of ict intensity and the intermediate inputs from ictproducing industries using the jip database we then follow the pim model to establish it and ct capital stock series for each of the  industries that coherently integrate with the cip capital accounts for our results show that over the entire period  chinas investment in ict equipment grew by  percent per annum which was about two folds of that of nonict equipment the share of ict investment in chinas nominal gdp peaked in  at around  percent yet declined to about  percent in the recent years similarly the ict investment share in nominal gfcf peaked in  at around  percent and then declined to about  percent in  largely attributable to the governments unprecedented investment in infrastructures to sustain growth despite such a relative decline in this share by  chinas ict intensity measured as the share of ict equipment in the total equipment stock had reached  percent which was about  percent that of japan   and  percent that of the us   in sectoral comparisons we show that chinas service sector is moreict intensive  than its industrial sector  a similar pattern to but a narrower spread than that of japan  vs   and the us  vs   chinas catch up in icts is obvious albeit competing policy objectives and distorted market environment yet remaining data problems such as the missing of software and price problems may still challenge the reliability of our estimates and upon which our findings , estimation of chinas

Research paper_Journal article,UVNVJ_18_2.docx,Other,UVNVJ_18_2.docx,division of gastroenterology and hepatology department of medicine kitasato university school of medicine kanagawa japandepartment of gastroenterology kitasato university school of medicine kitasato minamiku sagamihara kanagawa  japantel faxemailckusanokitasatouacjplau et al summarized previous reports in this review on the timing of emergency endoscopic procedures for aiugbacute upper gastrointestinal bleeding especially the need for endoscopic procedures within  hours h of consultation  to date scoring systems have been developed to predict prognosis after hemostasis but there is no scoring system to indicate whether a patient needs emergency endoscopy within  hours they reported that there was no difference in the prognosis of patients treated within  hours versus  hours for aiugb the results support that endoscopic hemostasis do not have to be performed unreasonably at night and under unmanned conditions aiugb is a disease of significant importance even in medically advanced countries and has a lethality rate of  the main cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding is nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding which includes gastric ulcers duodenal ulcers including dieulafoy ulcers malignant tumors and malloryweiss syndromemy shift in the gastroenterology department has just begun at night after  pm i receive a call from the emergency department the patient is a yearold man he has come in because he had a small amount of hematemesis after eating it has never happened before there are no abnormalities in his blood tests or vital signs there are no major complications he said he was drinking alcohol with meals what are you going to do doctor shall we prep the patient for endoscopy i am the only person on duty in the gastroenterology department if treatment is necessary i will have to call another staff member what should i do many endoscopists have experienced this situation it goes without saying that the patients life should be the first priority however hospitals simply do not have sufficient staff and equipment available or accessible round the clock especially small hospitals what is the proper treatment strategy in this situationthere have been many attempts to develop scoring tools for upper gastrointestinal bleeding to assess the risk of rebleeding and patient prognosis among these the glasgowblachford score gbs rockall score and aim score have been reported to be particularly useful and have come into widespread use however none of these scores has been prepared for the purpose of predicting and assessing the need for urgent hemostatic treatment therefore the usefulness of gbs and aim to evaluate therapeutic interventions for bleeding has also been investigated it has been reported that endoscopic intervention was required with a gbs score of  or higher and that with a gbs score of  or higher delays in endoscopy significantly increased patient mortality scores created by iino et al which modify existing scoring methods in an effort to predict a patients need for emergency treatment have also been reported thus attempts have been made to create useful scores that predict the need for urgent hemostatic treatment however none have been effectively used in actual clinical practicefor ulcerative lesions which are the main cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding antacids have a high recuperative effect with this in mind lau et al reported that ppis exhibit hemostatic effects in a randomized trial on the need for endoscopic hemostasis with preendoscopic highdose ppi administration the group receiving ppi had a significantly lower rate of requiring endoscopic hemostasis lower rate of active bleeding from ulcers and higher rate of ulcers with clean bases these results demonstrated that the theorized ulcer healing effects of ppi do work in clinical situations and the findings made quite a stir in the world of gastroenterology it is now clear that whether or not ppis have been administered is also a major factor in determining whether urgent endoscopic treatment is requiredif the patients condition is indeed urgent within how many hours must treatment occur in the above situation must treatment be carried out by midnight or can the patient wait until morning in an effort to answer this question lau et al divided patients with a gbs score of  or more into two groups one group underwent endoscopy within less than  hours the other underwent endoscopy within  hours then they measured the mortality rate within  days there was no difference in the mortality rate and no significant difference in the length of hospital stay and the transition rate to surgery these results indicate that assuming that the patient has received highdose ppi treatment it is permissible to wait at least  hours before performing tests and procedures conversely it should be noted that that study excluded patients in hemodynamic shock and variceal bleedingthere are some methods of endoscopic hemostasis ethanol injection epinephrine injection hemoclips and hemostatic forceps in randomized trial the success rate of endoscopic hemostasis other than epinephrine injection is nearly  and there is no difference regardless of which method is chosen on the other hand epinephrine injection has a rebleeding rate of  and should be used in combination with other hemostatic techniques on the contrary in the case of hemoclips and hemostatic forceps it has been reported that coagulation forceps reduces the rebleeding rate  although it depends largely on the type of clips and the skill of the endoscopist coagulation forcept may be a better option when manpower is not available or urgency is required because it reduces the need for another hemostatic procedure and shortens the time to complete hemostasisrecently the unsuccessful factor and cause of rebleeding for endoscopic hemostasis with peptic ulcer was reported kubota y et al  reported that the unsuccessful factors for endoscopic hemostasis were shock index is more than  duodenal ulcer bleeding exposed blood vessel diameter more than mm with contrast enhanced computed tomography and forrest ia rpmastad kk et al  described that rebleeding rate after endoscopic hemostasis for peptic ulcer was  the predictive factor for rebleeding was any comorbidly disease with odds ratio or   ci  and duodenal ulcer with or   ci  which was uncertain result ulcer bleeding with the factors mentioned above should always be treated with the knowledge that endoscopic hemostasis may be difficult or even if endoscopic hemostasis is achieved there is a possibility of rebleedingfujishiro m et al state that interventyional radiology ivr and surgery should be considered for patients who have failed endoscopic treatment large ulcer size and the presence of hypovolemic shock have been identified as factors that may lead to failure of the initial hemostatic procedure and rebleeding on the other hand the success rate of ivr hemostasis is also  and there is a risk of rebleeding so we should not assume that ivr will be a permanent hemostasis on the other hand whether ivr or surgery is better as a treatment for rebleeding after endoscopic treatment is also being examined it has been reported that surgery is associated with longer hospital stay and higher mortality rate so ivr may be a better choice from the viewpoint of minimally invasive method even if the success rate of hemostasis is not artificial intelligence ai is making rapid progress as shown by such advances as siri and autonomous driving but what does intelligence mean it is the ability to collect information and make appropriate decisions based on this information being intelligent means not only remembering a lot of information but also being able to use that information to make comprehensive decisions regarding upper gastrointestinal bleeding ai will collect information and the day may come when it is possible to determine whether urgent endoscopy is necessary and if necessary whether it should be done within  hours shung et al successfully used machine learning to stratify patients with upper gastrointestinal tract disease who do not require inpatient treatment and can be sent home after an outpatient visit alonethere has been extensive research on the glasgowblachford score gbs rockall score and aim in addition the risks associated with oral antithrombotic drugs helicobacter pylori infection and eradication and whether emergency endoscopy is performed are also involved in the outcomes of patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding but the aforementioned scoring systems do not account for these factors since gastrointestinal bleeding is a continuing problem despite medical advances we believe scoring systems capable of assembling tailored treatment algorithms at the time of patient consultation are sorely needed the capabilities of ai may mean this level of algorithm assembly will be possible in the very near future perhaps we will soon be able to provide an immediate response to the question i posed earlier in the case of a patient who experienced

Research paper_Journal article,UZIVV_1.docx,Research paper_Journal article,UZIVV_1.docx,background hyperthymic temperament is cheerful action orientation and is suggested to have a protective effect on depressive symptoms responsiveness for reward which is diminished in depressive patients are suggested to be related with hyperthymic temperament also neural hypoactivation in the reward system in depressive patients has been well known however only a few previous studies have investigated the neurobiological substrate of hyperthymic temperament we investigated the relationship between hyperthymic temperament and responsiveness for monetary reward at neural levelmethods healthy participants performed a modified version of the monetary incentive mmid task in the fmri scanner we explored the brain region where neural responsiveness for monetary reward was predicted by hyperthymic temperamentsresults brain areas in the reward system were widely activated for reward anticipation activations in the left thalamus and the left putamen were positively predicted by hyperthymic temperament on the other hand activations in the ventral striatum and the right insula were not modulated by hyperthymic temperament no region that activated for outcome of reward did not modulated by hyperthymic temperamentlimitations behavioral responsiveness for reward was not predicted by hyperthymic temperament or neural activity also we did not correct p values for the multiple regression analysis considering that this study is exploratory researchconclusions we found the neurobiological foundation for the protective aspect of hyperthymic temperament against depression in the reward system our findings suggest that hyperthymic temperament may modulate the attentional or motor response or optimal selection of behavior based on reward rather than value representationtemperament is the temporally stable biological core of personality rihmer et al  based on kraepelin s earlier description akiskal et al  developed operational criteria to identify four fundamental states of manic depressive illness as depressive cyclothymic hyperthymic and irritable temperament later anxious temperament was added and tempsa akiskal et al  a item selfadministered questionnaire was developed to assess temperaments hyperthymic temperament is cheerful upbeat and actionoriented disposition akiskal   which has been proposed to associated with bipolarity akiskal  on the other hand hyperthymic temperament is suggested to have a protective effect on depression karam et al  for example major depressive disorder mdd patients showed lower hyperthymic temperament compared to healthy control aguiar ferreira et al  furthermore healthy relatives of depressed patients have a higher depression risk and they show also a lower hyperthymic aguiar ferreira et al  studies examining the genetic background of temperament gonda et al   have indicated that the hyperthymic temperament is clinically and biologically different from the other four temperamentsall of which contain more or less depressive component rihmer et al  these findings suggest that there is a neurobiological basis for the protective aspect of hyperthymic temperament against depression however to our knowledge neurobiological foundation of this aspect has fewly been investigated but see harada et al  hatano et al  and qiu et al  diminished interest for reward is a core of depression american psychiatric association  and decreased responsiveness for monetary reward in depressive people has repeatedly been reported at both behavioral clrymelin et al  henriques and davidson  and neural level pizzagalli et al  stoy et al  metaanalyses comparing healthy controls and mdd patients in aspect of neural responsiveness for reward have shown hypoactivation of subregions of the striatum ng et al  zhang et al  the insula and the thalamus zhang et al  all of which belong to or are closely related to the reward system haber and knutson   given the finding that hyperthymic temperament is positively correlated with reward dependence akiskal et al b the protective aspect of hyperthymic temperament against depression may be associated with the reward system in the brain  the aim of this study is to investigate the neurobiological foundation of the protective aspect of hyperthymic temperament against mdd using functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri measurement during the monetary incentive delay task we hypothesized that participants with higher hyperthymic temperament would have higher reward responsiveness and more activation of rewardrelated brain regionsall the analyzed participants were recruited from our participant pool n which was shared with wakatsuki et al under review all participants in the pool signed a written consent form participants that fulfilled all of the following criteria were included in our analysis the algorism is shown in figure s  completing the questionnaire see below  within  years to avoid the effect of aging see desposito et al  dhingra et al   righthanded ie positive score in the edinburgh handedness inventory oldfield   no metabolic syndromes  no structural deficits eg calcification  no serious distortion in functional images and  no symptoms or history of any psychiatric disorders current psychiatric disorders were screened by a psychiatrist using the miniinternational neuropsychiatric interview sheehan et al  japanese version otsubo et al  depressive and manic episodes were also screened by the patient health questionnaire phq kroenke et al  japanese version muramatsu et al  and the manic episode screening questionnaire mes kameyama et al  respectively in particular participants who scored   at least more than half of the days in these two weeks for q or q and furthermore scored   more than two items out of  questions in the phq were excluded from the analysis due to suspicion for depressive disorders participants who answered yes for q in the mes were excluded due to suspicion for manic episodes therefore all the analyzed participants were classified as psychiatrically healthy controls experiments were conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki world medical association  and approved by the institutional review board of hokkaido university hospitalas a main task we used a modified version of the monetary incentive delay task mmid task knutson et al  the scheme is described in figure  at the beginning of a trial a numeric cue was presented for ms the cue represented the amount of monetary reward japanese yen that participants got if they succeeded in following button press following the presentation of a fixation cross jittered from  to ms a target indicated by a white square was presented subsequently an outcome was presented for ms when participants hit the target ie successfully pressing the button during the presentation of the target the amount of gained reward was presented in the upper line with white color when participants miss the target ie failing to press the button during the presentation of the target the number zero was presented in the upper line with blue color the cumulative amount of gained reward in the current session was presented in the bottom line with white color after an interval ms the next trial started thus it took  seconds per trialthere were five trial types  five hundred yen  one hundred yen  lose one hundred yen when participants miss the target   yen no monetary reward was given but whether participants succeeded in button press was indicated by the color in the outcome phase ie hit or miss feedback was given and  no monetary reward was given and miss outcome was always presented ie hit or miss feedback was not given note that even in the  trials we recorded whether participants pressed the button during the presentation of the target in the background as well as in the other trial types we asked participants to try to hit the target regardless of the trial types we examined the difference in responsiveness of the subjects in the  and  trials which will be reported in a separate paper ogura et al in prepinitially participants received an outscanner training each five types of the cues were presented and the presentation duration of the target was set to ms if participants succeeded in hitting the target  times except for the  trial the training was finished and proceeded to the inscanner training if not presentation duration of the target was lengthened by ms increment and then the training was repeated the outscanner training was continued until the participant succeeded in hitting the target  times next participants received an inscanner training after they are entered to and are fixed in a scanner initial presentation duration of the target was set to the final duration of the out scanner training an inscanner training was composed of  trials ie each type of the cue was pseudorandomly presented for four times if participants succeeded in button press  times out of  trials except for four  trials the subject could proceed to the main task the initial presentation duration of the target for the main task was calculated asto keep hit rates of participants around  percent we adjusted presentation duration of the target according to the performance of each participant knutson et al  if participants hit the target in all of the latest three trials except for  or  trials the presentation duration of the target was shortened by ms ie the next trial became more difficult than the previous one in contrast if participants miss the target in  times out of three trials except for  or  the presentation duration of the target was lengthened by ms ie the next trial became easier than the previous onethe main task was composed of two runs and each run was composed of  trials each type of the cue was pseudorandomly presented for ten times in each run thus participants faced  trials per each trial typeafter the main task participants worked on a fingertapping task they were asked to tap their thumb by their other fingers using their dominant hand s fingertapping was repeated three times with a s resting period note that fingertapping test was conducted aimed at ensuring that functional image was correctly acquired and was not included in the

deichmann et al  for the mmid task a total of  volumes was acquired twice for the fingertapping task a total of  volumes was acquiredfor detection of responses for a target we used response pads

positively predicted by the hyperthymic scores estimated coefficient   p   of temps similar to the right thalamus the best model for the beta values at the right anterior insula consists of hyperthymic estimated coefficient   p   and irritative estimated coefficient   p   scores but the p value for the coefficient for the hyperthymic scores was not significant also the best model for the beta values at the left putamen consists of hyperthymic estimated coefficient   p   depressive estimated coefficient   p   and irritative estimated coefficient   p   scores beta values at the right caudateaccumbens were marginally positively predicted by the hyperthymic scores estimated coefficient   p   and the depressive scores estimated coefficient   p   the best model further contained the irritative scores estimated coefficient   p   in contrast beta values at the left caudateaccumbens did not predicted by any temps scoresa peak at the right precuneus was survived for the contrast  minus  table  we tested whether the beta values at the right precuneus could be predicted by the scores of temps sex and age the best model consisted of sex as an explanatory variable estimated coefficient   p  any scores of temps did not significantly predict the beta values at the right precuneus to reveal the neural foundation of how hyperthymic temperament have a protective effect on depression we explanatory addressed the brain region related with monetary reward modulated by hyperthymic temperament using fmri to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to examine the relationship between hyperthymic temperament and the reward system as we hypothesized participants with high hyperthymic temperament had higher activity in the left thalamus and left putamen which are included in the reward system diminished responsiveness of the brain reward system has been repeatedly reported in mdd patients admon and pizzagalli  pizzagalli et al  zhang et al  therefore the present findings may provide a neurobiological foundation for the protective aspect of hyperthymic temperament against depressionabout the left thalamus a metaanalysis shows that activation in this region is decreased in mdd patients during the processing of monetary rewards zhang et al  this is consistent with the anatomical observation that gray matter concentration in this region is reported to be decreased in mdd patients lee et al  these findings are in line with our hypothesis the left thalamus has been repeatedly reported that it responds to reward anticipation oldham et al  although the thalamus has traditionally been described as a relay system it is now known that the relay nuclei of the thalamus have direct projections to the striatum haber and mcfarland  mcfarland and haber  and their role in the reward neurocircuit has also been examined neurophysiological study suggested that presentation of a salient stimulus that is paired with reward activates neurons projecting from the thalamus to the striatum and causes a burst of cholinergic interneurons in the striatum ding et al  these findings suggest that during reward processing the thalamus gates striatal activity to modulate attentional or motor responses and cortical input considering that higher hyperthymic temperament was associated with higher activation in the left thalamus people with a high hyperthymic temperament may be more likely to be attentive or to have a motor response in the reward processing processas for the left putamen neural response for reward size is reported to be diminished in mdd patients takamura et al  and suggested to be associated with anhedonia keedwell et al  again our results are in line with our hypothesis interestingly it has been reported that the putamen does not simply encode the hedonic aspect of the reward or the reward prediction error behavioral studies measuring the effort costs for rewards suggest that anhedonia in depression is not expressed by reduction in pleasure per se but rather by an impaired ability to modify behavior as a function of positive reinforcement admon and pizzagalli  a detailed study using the stimulusactionreaction association learning paradigm haruno and kawato  indicates that the putamen codes for stimulusactiondependent reward prediction rather than the reward prediction error which is coded in the more ventral striatal area that is putamen seems to play a major role in linking incentives to action pizzagalli  moreover this neural correlation is consistent with anatomical findings that putamen receives projections from the sensorimotor cortices including the dorsal and ventral premotor cortices the supplementary motor area and the primary motor cortex gerardin et al  parthasarathy et al  selemon and goldmanrakic  takada et al  the hyperthymic temperament may modulate the optimal selection of behavior based on reward rather than a representation of reward magnitude  metaanalysis for mid paradigm shows that the ventral striatum and the insula are activated in reward anticipation as well as the thalamus oldham et al  these regions also activated for the cue of monetary reward in this study however the activation did not be modulated by the hyperthymic temperament this finding also supports the implication that the hyperthymic temperament may modulate the action selection based on reward rather than a representation of reward magnitude actually both of the activation in the anterior insula and the nucleus accumbens track reward magnitude clithero et al  considering the role of the insula for interoceptive state bud craig  and the anatomical projection to the nucleus accumbens from the anterior insula chikama et al  the anterior insula may integrate interospective state with reward cue and send information to the nucleus accumbens clithero et al  naqvi and bechara  and then the nucleus accumbens represents reward value hyperthymic temperament does not seem to associate directly to this process the limitation of the present study is that while we showed that reward responsiveness at the neural activity level was predicted by hyperthymic temperament reward responsiveness at the behavioral level was not predicted by hyperthymic temperament figure s also there was no correlation between behavioral performance in the mid task and reward responsiveness at the level of neural activity data not shown however no difference in behavioral performance on the mid task was found between the clinical population with depressive symptoms and the healthy control wakatsuki et al under review it is difficult to use behavioral performance alone to assess mdd in a relatively simple behavioral task such as mid and further exploration of neural intermediate phenotypes is needed moreover although we chose brain activation clusters using familywise error correction we did not correct p values for the subsequent multiple regression analysis considering that this study is exploratory researchdespite these limitations the present study showed that reward responsiveness in the brain are predicted by the hyperthymic temperament which would be protective against mddfigure  the modified version of monetary incentive delay mmid task a in the beginning of a reward trial the magnitude of reward   or punishment  was presented by a numeric number as a cue

Research paper_Journal article,VKFLO_49.docx,Research paper_Journal article,VKFLO_49.docx,fongmin ciou jiahong lin tingchang chang yushan lin juitse hsu fuyuan jin kaichun chang abstractin this study we analyze the threshold voltage vt degradation mechanism for a hot electron stress hes under semion state conditions in algangan high electron mobility transistors the drain current versus gate voltage idvg characteristic curves indicate that vt shifts in the positive direction after the stress however an abnormal phenomenon in which vt continuously shifts in the positive direction even after recovery is observed a comparison of the results for a negative bias stress nbs experiment indicates that a hole recombination in preexisting buffer defects is crucial therefore a complete model of vt degradation mechanism is proposed moreover the proposed model was confirmed through an illumination experiment and a silvaco simulation ecently ganbased high electronmobility transistors gan hemts have attracted attention owing to their prominent material properties such as a high electron mobility high electric breakdown field and wide band gap therefore they are widely applied in various hightemperature highvoltage and highfrequency devices  however several limitations such as a severe gate leakage current and normallyon operation restrict the development of gan hemts  therefore device structures such as a metalinsulatorsemiconductor gan hemt misgan hemt and recessedgate structures have been developed as a solution to these limitations  in both the structures an insulator is used as the barrier layer to resist the leakage current in addition the gan hemt is a normallyon device ie it has security issues during operation  therefore a recessedgate structure with an insulator as its barrier layer was developed to solve this issue     to date alo and sin have been used as common types of gate dielectrics for misgan hemts  however the use of sin has a few disadvantages such as an unstable threshold voltage vt  and highdensity interface trap states at the dielectricbarrier interface  moreover during a hardswitching operation  the device operates under the semion condition in which the drain current id flows from the source to drain owing to a hot electron stress hes induced by a high drain voltage vd in previous studies the hot electrons due to the high drain voltage results in an increase in ron which reduces the transconductance and id under the semion condition a previous study presented a few degradations of hes under the semion condition such as an impact ionization ii  defect generation  and hot electron trapping however most studies focused on the degradation of ron and id and ignored the importance of vt instability under the semion condition thus hesinduced vt instability was analyzed in this study moreover a significant positive shift in vt was observed during the recovery time the main reason for this shift is that the electrons in the preexisting buffer traps  are compensated by holes generated by the ii due to the unavoidable buffer defects generated during the epitaxy process it is also noteworthy and necessary to research the effect of buffer defects during the semion state operation based on the results for different hes conditions under the semion state this study demonstrates a complete model of vt degradationthe mishemts analyzed in this study were fabricated by metal organic chemical vapor deposition mocvd on a silicon substrate as shown in fig a a  m carbondoped gan buffer layer was grown on top of the si substrate to prevent a leakage current from the source to drain moreover a  nm gan layer and  nm algan layer were deposited on the buffer layer which formed a twodimensional electron gas due to spontaneous and piezoelectric polarizations a thin gan cap layer was deposited on the algan layer to reduce the surface leakage current and prevent a reverse piezoelectric effect finally a  nm thick sin insulating layer was deposited by plasmaenhanced chemical vapor deposition pecvd to restrain the gate leakage current the source and drain ohmic contacts were composed of tial and a gate contact was formed using niau for a low contact resistance the gate length of the analyzed devices was  m and the lengths from the sourcetogate and gatetodrain were  and  m respectively in this study all electrical characteristics were measured using a keysight ba semiconductor parameter analyzer and tesla eps probe station the hes experiment in this study involves the application of a constant negative bias to the gate electrode vg   v where the drain electrode was maintained at a positive bias vd   v and source electrode was grounded fig b shows the id versus gate voltage vg characteristic curves of the hes application for  s and its subsequent recovery as observed vt shifts in the positive direction after stress application for  s owing to the trapping of hot electrons however a continuous vt shift in the positive direction is observed during the recovery time where the recovery is grounded in the source drain and gate electrodes to confirm the occurrence of an abnormal phenomenon in the semion state vt of hes with a constant vd   v and a different stress vg which is in the range of the semion state are shown in fig c regardless of the vg condition vt deteriorated significantly during the recovery moreover the offstate current ioff decreased after  s of stress and did not recover during the recovery time which corresponds to the ig versus vg characteristic curves as shown in fig d this suggests that there was no electron trapping or detrapping caused by sin thus the area where the abnormal vt occurs during the recovery time is not located in sin  to verify whether it is related to the high drain electric field a negative bias stress nbs experiment was also conducted in this experiment the same stress vg was applied which is in the range of semion state with the source and drain grounded vt and ig degradation with different vg stress values are shown in fig a and b evidently both vt and ig degrade after  s of stress but recover significantly after  s which is contrary to the hes results however only a negative bias was applied to the gate electrode during the nbs and the degradation of vt and ig occur because of the injected electrons in sin from the gate electrode as shown in fig c thus the abnormal vt recovery is caused by the high drain electric field during the hes in contrast to nbs highenergy electrons emerge owing to the high drain electric field which are trapped in the sinalgan interface defects during the stress causing a vt shift in the positive direction after a  s stress moreover ii occurs simultaneously because of the high gatetodrain voltage generating electronhole pairs in addition there are some preexisting defects which trap electrons in the buffer and these electrons are recombined with the generated holes by ii during the stress as shown in fig d thus during recovery electrons refill the buffer traps resulting in a continuous vt shift in the positive direction however because there is no applied drain electric field during the nbs electrons are trapped in the gatesin interface defects because of a gate injection during the stress and detrapped during the recovery considering the experimental data and results of the nbs experiment a physical degradation mechanism model of the hes under the semion state is proposed as shown in fig  the energy band diagram of the initial state is shown in fig a as mentioned above the original buffer defects caused by epitaxy are occupied by electrons during the hes process under the semion state condition electrons are trapped in the gatesin interface defects by the gate injection owing to the applied negative gate bias moreover there are hot electrons which acquire energy from the high drain electric field and are trapped in the sinalgan interface defects by a channel injection however due to ii electrons trapped in the gan layer under the gate are recombined with the holes as shown in fig b thus vt shifts in the positive direction after the stress due to electron trapping consequently the trapped electrons increase the energy barrier height as shown in fig c which results in an ig reduction as shown in fig d finally during the recovery process electrons in the channel refill the unoccupied defects in the buffer resulting in a severe positive shift in vt as shown in fig dto further confirm the model the hes experiment in which the stress vg is in the range of the semion state with a constant vd   v for a  s stress time was performed the only difference in the previous hes experiment and this one is that different radiations were applied during the  s recovery time the radiations used during the recovery time include a wavelength of  red light  green light  blue light  uv light and  nm uv light which coresspond to     and  ev energies figs a and b illustrate the vt and ig degradation corresponding to different radiations used during the illumination recovery it is evident that both vt and ig recover partially under the illumination of different radiation this is because the trapped electrons in the sinalgan interface defects absorb the energy of radiation and detrap causing a decrease in the barrier height which results in the recovery of vt and ig as shown in fig c moreover it is verified that there are hot electrons which acquire the energy from the high drain electric field injected in the sinalgan interface defects to further confirm the proposed model a silvaco simulation of the energy band diagram after the stress and recovery is shown in fig d in the simulation the initial density of the buffer defects is   cm and the density of electrons trapped in the sinalgan interface defects after the stress is    cm  after the recovery the density of electrons trapped in the sinalgan interface and buffer defects were also    and    cm in the simulation electrons are put in the  and  nm depth under the channel however no matter electrons trap in  nm or  nm depth in the buffer the same result will be observed which the vt continuously shifts in the positive direction during the recovery the uniform and nonuniform density of electrons in the buffer are also simulated the density of electrons in the whole buffer is  cm to simulate the uniform density besides in order to simulate dislocation defects the decrease density of electrons from  cm near the bottom of buffer to  cm near the top of buffer is simulated because the dislocation is severer in the bottom buffer than top buffer for these two situations the same result is also obtained the conduction band will increase due to electrons refilled in buffer defects and cause the vt continuously shifts in the positive direction during the recovery this observation is consistent with the model proposed in this study this study analyzes in detail an abnormal vt shift phenomenon observed in hes under the semion state condition in algangan high electron mobility transistors according to the idvg characteristic curves it is evident that vt not only shifts in the positive direction after the stress but also after its recovery during the hes hot electrons are generated by the high drain electric field injected into the sinalgan interface defects resulting in vt shifts in the positive direction simultaneously ii occurs during the stress and generates electronhole pairs the holes recombine with the trapped electrons in the preexisting buffer defects during the recovery electrons in the channel refill the unoccupied defects in the buffer resulting in a severe positive shift in vt morever the vt degradation

current study aimed to clarify the management of iln metastasis according to its classification and treatment strategy especially surgical treatmentmethods this retrospective multicenter observational study included patients with synchronous or metachronous iln metastasis who were diagnosed with rectal or anal canal adenocarcinoma between january  and december  treatment outcomes were analyzed according to the recurrence and prognosisresults among  consecutive patients who received treatment for rectal or anal canal adenocarcinoma at  referral hospitals   and   had synchronous and metachronous iln metastases respectively among  patients with iln metastasis differentiated carcinoma solitary iln metastasis and iln dissection were identified as independent factors associated with good prognosis no significant difference was found in the frequency of recurrence after iln dissection between those with synchronous  or metachronous iln metastasis  patients who underwent r resection of the primary tumor and iln dissection had a year survival rate of  after iln dissection  and  in patients with synchronous and metachronous iln metastases respectively p   conclusion iln can be appropriately classified as a regional lymph node ln in rectal and anal canal adenocarcinoma moreover aggressive iln dissection might be effective in improving the prognosis of low rectal and anal canal adenocarcinoma with iln metastasis and prophylactic iln dissection is not necessarygiven the rarity of anorectal adenocarcinoma with inguinal lymph node iln metastasis there is limited knowledge regarding its clinicopathological characteristics or treatment outcomes in rectal and anal canal adenocarninoma iln can be classified as regional lymph nodes and aggressive iln dissection might improve their prognosis with iln metastasisinguinal lymph node iln metastasis has been most commonly found in patients with anal canal carcinoma a rare type of cancer that accounts for  of all digestive system cancers  however studies have shown that similar to anal canal cancer lower rectal cancer also metastasizes to ilns with an incidence rate of   notably anal canal and rectal cancers occasionally overlap posing difficulties in determining the anatomical origin of the anorectal carcinoma most primary cancers of the anal canal in western countries are squamous cell carcinomas sccs comprising almost  of all anal canal cancer cases  on the other hand in asian countries adenocarcinomas are the most common anal canal carcinomas  according to the tumornodemetastasis tnm classification iln metastasis from colorectal cancer which is mostly adenocarcinoma is classified as a nonregional ln metastasis  although iln metastasis from anal canal cancer which is mostly scc is categorized as a regional ln metastasis based on accumulating evidence from studies on anal canal scc  national comprehensive cancer network nccn guidelines recommend groin dissection for metachronous iln metastasis from squamous cell anal canal carcinoma after chemoradiotherapy  some studies recommend systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy for anorectal adenocarcinoma with iln metastasis due to the frequency of distant metastasis and a poor prognosis  while other studies have demonstrated that solitary iln metastasis showed favorable prognosis after ln excision  however treatment strategies especially surgical treatment for iln metastasis of anorectal adenocarcinoma remain controversial given the rarity of anorectal adenocarcinoma with iln metastasis there is limited knowledge regarding its clinicopathological characteristics or treatment outcomesthe current study aimed to clarify the management of iln metastasis from adenocarcinoma of the rectum and the anal canal according to its

overall survival curves after the diagnosis of iln metastasis in patients with iln dissection are presented in figure  fiveyear survival rates after iln metastasis diagnosis and after iln dissection

b d eightyseven patients who underwent r resection of the primary tumor and iln dissection had a year survival rate of  after iln dissection  and  in patients with synchronous and metachronous iln metastases respectively p   the results of univariate and multivariate analyses of factors that affected survival are summarized in table  logrank test demonstrated that differentiated carcinoma negative lymphatic invasion presence of one iln metastasis and iln dissection were significant prognostic factors after the diagnosis of iln metastasis fig  moreover the cox proportional hazard model identified differentiated carcinoma presence of one iln metastasis and iln dissection as significant independent prognostic factors table iln metastasis from rectal and anal canal adenocarcinoma was reported to have incidence rates of   and   respectively meanwhile in the present study  of patients with rectal and anal canal adenocarcinoma had synchronous ilnm and  of patients had metachronous iln metastasis altogether iln metastasis was observed in  of patients with rectal and anal canal adenocarcinoma lymph drainage below the dentate line is mainly directed to the superficial iln while lymph drainage proximal to the dentate line is directed toward the anorectal perirectal paravertebral and to some extent the internal iliac lymph nodes which can be an indirect lymphatic route to the iln  the present study results suggest that lateral ln metastasis was associated with iln metastasis since  and more than  of patients who had iln metastasis and synchronous iln metastasis respectively exhibited lateral ln metastasis contrarily blockage of ascending flow for neoplastic involvement of the proximal ln as well as neoplastic spread resulting from pelvic recurrence in patients who previously underwent rectal radical resection could be valid theories for iln metastasis of rectal cancer  our findings indicate that differences in the frequencies of ln metastasis and pelvic ln recurrence between patients who had synchronous and metachronous iln metastases might depend on the method through which ascending lymphatic flow was blockedwe also found that patients with iln metastasis who underwent r resection with iln dissection had an overall recurrence rate iln recurrence rate and year survival rate of   and  respectively although the database of this study does not allow comparison with cases with nonmetastatic iln year survival rate of stage iiib anal canal adenocarcinoma is reported almost  according to the jsccr guideline  and the prognosis for cases with iln metastasis in this study appears to be poorer than that for nonmetastatic cases previous reports have also shown that the prognosis of cases with iln metastasis is poor  compared to patients with lateral ln metastasis who underwent lateral ln dissection which was often performed for low rectal cancer in previous studies  overall and iln recurrence rates after iln dissection in cases of iln metastasis seemed worse than overall and lateral ln recurrence rates respectively after lateral ln dissection in cases of lateral ln metastasis however patients with iln metastasis from anorectal cancer were considered to have no worse prognosis than those with positive lateral ln metastasis based on reports that showed a year overall survival rate of  in patients with low rectal carcinoma showing lateral spread  the results mentioned above might be attributed to the fewer hematogenous recurrences in our patients with iln metastasis than those with lateral ln metastasis in previous studies  moreover iln metastasis may be a more local disease than lateral ln metastasis although the tnm and jsccr  classifications categorize iln as a regional ln in anal canal carcinoma both classification systems do not categorize iln as a regional ln in low rectal cancer however similar to lateral ln iln may be appropriately classified as a regional ln in low rectal and anal canal adenocarcinoma considering the frequency of metastasis and treatment outcomes in the present studyadditionally no significant differences in prognosis overall recurrence and iln recurrence were observed between synchronous and metachronous iln metastases iln metastasis can be diagnosed through palpation and imaging upon medical examination and complicated intraabdominal procedures may not be necessary for iln dissection even after primary tumor resection furthermore studies have reported the occurrence of surgical complications including lymphedema of the lower limb lymphocele and inguinal lymphorrhea which are caused by iln dissection and are associated with decreased quality of life  despite reports that lateral ln metastasis occurred in approximately  of patients with rectal cancer in whom the lower edge of the tumor was located below the peritoneal reflection  prophylactic lateral ln dissection remains controversial  thus performing prophylactic iln dissection to lower the risk of iln recurrence is considered unnecessary although significantly more patients with metachronous iln metastasis than those with synchronous iln metastasis developed solitary iln metastasis significantly fewer patients with metachronous iln metastasis than those with synchronous iln metastasis underwent surgery based on our finding that solitary iln metastasis and iln dissection were associated with better prognosis the current study suggests that aggressive iln dissection for metachronous iln metastasis seems effective for improving prognosis moreover our results suggest the importance of intensive postoperative surveillance for recurrence within  months after the dissection of synchronous iln metastasis and postoperative followup beyond  months for metachronous iln metastasis furthermore the current study indicates pelvic ln and iln as recurrence sites in patients with metachronous iln metastasisamong patients with iln metastasis those who received chemoradiotherapy had worse intrapelvic local recurrence rates and prognosis than those who underwent iln dissection suggesting that chemoradiotherapy should not be recommended as a standard treatment for anorectal adenocarcinoma however no difference was noted in the frequency of iln recurrence between those who received chemoradiotherapy and those who underwent iln dissection although the followup duration was shorter for patients who received chemoradiotherapy than for those who underwent iln dissection akiyoshi et al reported that chemoradiotherapy had limited effects against metastatic ln and ln dissection might improve local control and survival based on the finding that lateral ln metastasis developed in  of  patients with a preoperative diagnosis of lateral ln metastasis who received chemoradiotherapy for low rectal cancer  however our results suggest that chemoradiotherapy could be an effective local treatment for iln metastasis following future progress in chemotherapy and radiotherapythis retrospective study had several limitations first some patients were excluded from further analysis because of insufficient background data second the sample size was relatively small due to the rarity of iln metastasis from rectal or anal canal cancer third treatment strategies for iln metastasis were not similar among the included hospitals forth because there is no control group it is not possible to know whether the inguinal node dissection actually improved survival outcome or that this simply represents selection bias however our observations warrant further consideration and validation through additional prospective studies involving a larger series of patients with iln metastasis from anorectal cancerthe current study suggests iln can be appropriately classified as a regional ln based on low rectal and anal canal cancer strategies moreover prophylactic iln dissection might not be necessary after considering the frequency of iln metastasis treatment outcomes and reported adverse events finally the current study suggests that aggressive iln dissection may effectively improve the prognosis of patients with iln metastasis from

online social support and depression mediating effect of selfesteem and gender difference which you submitted to international journal of mental health and addictionbased on the advice received i have decided that your manuscript could be reconsidered for publication should you be prepared to incorporate major revisions when preparing your revised manuscript you are asked to carefully consider the reviewer comments which can be found below and submit a list of responses to the comments you are kindly requested to also check the website for possible reviewer attachmentswhile submitting please check the filled in author data carefully and update them if applicable  they need to be complete and correct in order for the revision to be processed furtherthank you for giving us the chance to revise the manuscript we greatly appreciate yours and two other reviewers comments and suggestions the following section summarizes how we responded to each of the comments of the reviewers the revised portions are markedinblue inthe manuscriptreviewer this study demonstrated that selfesteem mediated the relationship between online social support and depression and gender moderated the indirect relationship between them specially the indirect effect of online social support on depression was only significant in the male group rather than in the female group i believe this paper has strengths and has the potential to make a contribution to the literature however substantive improvements will be needed before the paper can be published my main comments will be detailed point by point below i do hope my comments are helpfulthe authors only used screening questionnaire and did not make diagnosis of depression this means that they can only speak about depressive symptoms not depression itself interpretation referring to depression should be changed to depressive symptomsresponse thank you for your reminder we totally agree with your comments and have changed depression to depressive symptoms in the text we appreciate for your valuable advicein the sixth of the second paragraph of gender as a moderator studies indicated that males are significantly however there is only one reference corresponding to it giota  kleftaras response thank you for your suggestion we have corrected the grammatical error here by changing studies indicated to research demonstrates and checked the language expressions in the textin the section of participants and procedure please describe in detail the selection of participants and sampling methodsresponse thank you for your comment according to your advice we have added a part of the content procedure in the manuscript see pages and described the selection of participants and sampling methods in detaildata were collected from an online survey during october  participants were recruited from a university in henan province china and they were invited to complete an online survey voluntarily in order to understand students social network use and mental health electronic informed consent was obtained from all participants before they complete the questionnaires and the study approved from the ethics committee of the firs authors universityresponse thank you for your suggestion we have changed depression to depressive symptoms and capitalized the initial letter of the term in the text thank you for your reminderresponse thank you for your reminder we have changed b to  in the text we appreciate for your advicein the discussion section it would be helpful if the authors could put forward reasonable suggestions for the prevention of depression according to the results of this studyresponse thank you for your suggestion according to your advice we have refined the discussion section of this study and put forward reasonable suggestions for the prevention of depressive symptoms in light of the results of this study see pages  thank you for your reminder moreover we have carefully revised the language thank you for your review and valuable comments which significantly improved the quality of this studyby introducing online social support in relation to depression and selfesteem the results of the study bring some novelties in the literature the study also creates openings for further research on how males  females extract their social support onlinebeck inventory is a rather a clinical measure the scores obtained for the general population are usually lowresponse thank you for your reminder we agree with your comments beck depression inventory is a selfreport inventory that measures severity of depressive symptoms yang et al  in this study the total raw scores of depressive symptoms range from  to  and the mean standard deviation median skewness and the kurtosis was     and  respectively this indicates that the depression levels of the subjects are indeed positively skewed which is quite consistent with your expectation considering the depressive symptoms fell within the acceptable range skewness cutoff of  and kurtosis cutoff of  curran west  finch  and the scale has been widely used in previous research chen et al  luminet cordovil de sousa uva fantini  de timary  we believe that the data from this scale are reliable we have revised the above in the manuscript see page  in order to use the results of this scale more accurately we have changed depression to depressive symptoms in the text thanks again for your comments a procedure needs to be introduced how were the  undergraduates recruited during what period was the data collection completedresponse thank you for your comment according to your advice we have described the selection of participants and sampling methods in detail in the manuscript see pages  data were collected from an online

enlightening again we are very grateful for the editor and reviewers insightful comments and suggestions which were extremely valuable and helpful in improving the quality of our manuscriptonline social support and depressive symptoms mediating effect of selfesteem and gender differenceonline communication has become an increasingly common phenomenon while the relationship between online social support and depressive symptoms and its mechanisms are unclear the purpose of this study is to explore the mediating effect of selfesteem and the moderating effect of gender in the relationship between online social support and depressive symptoms a sample of  undergraduates completed anonymous questionnaires regarding online social support selfesteem and depressive symptoms the results indicated that online social support was negatively associated with depressive symptoms and selfesteem mediated the relationship between online social support and depressive symptoms moreover gender moderated the first part of the mediation process and the effect of online social support on selfesteem was more pronounced in the male group than in the female group these findings can advance understanding of how online social support is related to depressive symptoms which have implications for prevention and intervention of depressive symptoms in undergraduates depression is a constellation of negative emotions and behaviors including feelings of worthlessness and loneliness crying worrying about doing bad things and feeling the need to be perfect petersen et al  depression is an indicator of low psychological adjustment which not only seriously harm peoples interpersonal relationship social function and quality of life but also increase the risk of suicide maalouf atwi  brent  thapar collishaw pine  thapar  according to data from world health organization depression is the leading cause of disability and ill health in the world which affecting more than  million people globally and tending to become a major contributor to disease burden worldwide by  who  a metaanalysis indicated that around  of university students worldwide report depressive symptoms ibrahim kelly adams  glazebrook  and the overall prevalence of depression among chinese university students is  in studies conducted between  and  including  university students lei xiao liu  li social supportis an important protective factor against depression people with strong social support systems are more likely to recover from conditions that evoke a highstress response mcdougall et al  with the development of social networks online communication has been widely used all over the world which offers distinct opportunities for individuals to establish maintain and expand social support meng martinez holmstrom chung  cox  online social support refers to the extent to which individuals are respected supported and understood in online interpersonal interactions turner  researchers have noted that online social support is an important complement of inperson social support cole nick zelkowitz roeder  spinelli  and is similar to inperson social support in a variety of ways nick et al  despite evidence that online social support was negatively predicted depression cole et al  frison  eggermont  it has also been suggested that social media use harms adult mental health sujarwoto tampubolon  pierewan  therefore the relationship and the underlying mechanisms that online social support is related to depressive symptoms still unclearselfesteem refers to an individuals positive or negative evaluation of themselves rosenberg  it is a mental representation of the self and a major factor that influences selfevaluation and selfworth brown  dutton  people with higher selfesteem are more satisfied with themselves and have a more positive selfconcept peng et al  selfesteem is also an effective positive resource in coping with depression du king  chu  dubois et al  wu lai lau  walden  and metaanalysis data found that selfesteem on depression was significantly stronger than the effect of depression on selfesteem sowislo  orth  orth robins meier and conger  used data from  longitudinal studies found that high selfesteem individuals have a lower risk for developing depression social support is a critical component in maintaining individuals selfesteem sociometer theory conceptualizes selfesteem as a psychological gauge of social acceptance and rejection leary  leary tambor terdal  downs  perceived social support conveys being noticed being valued and loved by others and studies found that direct approval from significant others as well as social support can significantly increase individuals selfesteem kong ding  zhao  zhou wu  zhen  the popularity of social networking use prompts people to get social support online and experimental studies indicated that even short periods of social network use can enhances users selfesteem gentile twenge freeman  campbell  wilcox  stephen  moreover selfesteem has been proposed by many theorists as a mediating variable or process that influences developmental outcomes through different types of social environmental experiences dubois et al  and studies showed that selfesteem plays a mediating role between social support and adolescents subsequent depression chang yuan  chen  du et al  based on these it is possible that online social support enhance individuals selfesteem which in turn contributes to decrease depressive symptomsgender differences in the way men and women access and use social support have been widely discussed according to the socialrole theory individuals behaviors were shaped by the social culture eagly  males are expected to behave achievement autonomy and control emotions while females are expected to be nurturance dependence and express emotions eagly  wood  as a result these gender stereotypes discourage males from seeking help because proactive helpseeking behavior may make them appear dependent on others juvrud  rennels  studies have found males attitude towards psychological helpseeking is more negative and were less likely to seek and obtain social support than females barbee et al  juvrud  rennels  by contrast females were found to be more connected and socialized than males langtakac  osterweil  and they tend to seek for emotional support from others in a stressful environment and have a greater social support system than males ashton  fuehrer  frydenberg  lewis  taylor et al  additionally females are more likely to use the social support and benefit from it studies have found that social support had a stronger positive impact on females selfesteem and life satisfaction than males kong et al  waters  moore  however the association between social support and psychosocial outcomes may differ for males and females in the online context the anonymity and asynchronous of online communication might reduce barriers that had previously contributed to males reluctance to seek help and they can openly share their concerns and rely on others for assistance without feeling embarrassed in the network environment wang et al  research demonstrates that males are significantly more attracted to online social support than females giota  kleftaras  and males adopt as many helpseeking behaviors as females from teammates in the online games hong  hwang  moreover the relation between mobile social media use and friendship quality is stronger for males than for females wang et al  therefore online social support seems to be more effective for males than femalesthis study aimed at revealing the relationship between online social support and depressive symptoms as well as its mechanisms and gender difference specifically the present study constructed a moderated mediation model to investigate how online social support affects depressive symptoms and gender differences in the association based on the above analysis it was hypothesized that online social support is negatively associated with depressive symptoms h and selfesteem mediates the relationship between online social support and depressive symptoms h moreover gender moderates the direct h and indirect h association between online social support and depressive symptoms and online social support would be more effective for males than females the proposed model is shown in figure a sample of  chinese undergraduates was recruited and completed the questionnaires seven hundred and six  males age ranging from  to  m sd

support has become an important part of daily life especially for undergraduates who desire companionship but often being alone guided by the sociometer theory leary  leary et al  and socialrole theory eagly  wood  this study explored the relationship and underlying mechanism of online social support and depressive symptoms from an evolutionary perspective the results showed thatonline social support significantly predicted depressive symptoms and the relationship between them was mediated by selfesteem and moderated by genderthe present results support the hypothesis by demonstrating that online social support negatively correlated with depressive symptoms which is consistent with previous studies that both inperson social support du et al  landmanpeeters et al  mcdougall et al  and online social support cole et al  frison  eggermont  were associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms these findings suggest that online social support as a form of social support in the internet era may have the same effects as inperson social support in alleviating depressive symptoms in addition this study extend previous results cole et al  frison  eggermont  by conforming the mediating effect of selfesteem in the relationship between online social support and depressive symptoms this finding is in accordance with the sociometer theory leary  leary et al  which propose that when individuals are not valued or supported by others they may experience a decline in selfesteem and in turn triggers problem behaviors for instance studies indicated that people with low selfesteem are prone to ruminating about negative aspects of the self phillips  hine  spasojevic  alloy  and feel undeserving of positive outcomes wood heimpel manwell  whittington  which may increase risk for depressive symptoms whereas people with high selfesteem are more motivated to repair their negative moods heimpel wood marshall  brown  wood et al  thus more easier to recover from negative emotions and depressive symptoms this study further examined the gender differences in the association between online social support and depressive symptoms and results found that the effect of online social support on selfesteem was stronger in the male group than in the female group h this finding was congruent with previous researches which suggests that males benefit more from online communication valkenburg  peter  and mobile social media use wang et al  than females these results could be explained by the gender differences in obtaining and using online social support on one hand males usually reported less intimate relationships with friends eagly  wood  selfdisclosure rose  rudolph  and social support ashton  fuehrer  cole et al  frydenberg  lewis  in reallife interactions than females the prevalence of online social support provided them with another way to increase their social connections anywhere at any time therefore compared with females males may particularly benefit from online social support to enhance their selfesteem besides males usually establish new relationships through social networking sites whereas females tend to maintain existing relationships muscanell  guadagno  and comparing themselves with others haferkamp eimler papadakis  kruck  social networking sites provide perfect platform for positive selfpresentation and mostly induce upward comparison vogel rose roberts  eckles  and the upward social comparison often closely associated with jealousy and depressive symptoms appel crusius  gerlach  feinstein et al  negative selfevaluation and low selfesteem cramer song  drent  vogel et al  therefore the negative effect of social comparison on selfesteem might offsets the benefits of online social support on selfesteem to some extent for femalesin summary results of this study indicate that online social support can both negatively predict depressive symptoms directly and indirectly by increasing individuals selfesteem and males benefit more from online social support than females this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the relationship and its mechanism between online social support and depressive symptoms and further clarifies the gender difference in the relationship the present findings have implications in preventing and reducing depressive symptoms in undergraduates first this study found that online social support negatively correlated depressive symptoms in light of the convenience that online support can be accessed anytime and anywhere it is of great practical significance that undergraduates to utilize online social support appropriately to reduce depressive symptoms in addition our findings suggest that online social support can alleviate depressive symptoms by enhancing selfesteem and selfesteem is relatively plastic and amenable to intervention peng et al  thus selfesteem enhancement programs may be effective interventions third the result show that the indirect effect of online social support on depressive symptoms was only significant in the male group rather than in the female group which indicates that males benefit more from online social support than females the result implies that educators and families could give boys more online social support in the internet era and provide guidance to boys in utilizing social networks appropriately it should be noted that some studies have found that online social support positively correlated with internet addiction lin et al  liu  ma  tang chen yang chung  lee  wang  wang  therefore people should focus on its potential risks while enjoying the benefits of online social supportalthough the results supported our hypotheses some limitations need to be mentioned at present study first this study only considered the relationship between online social support and depressive symptoms whereas the inperson social support was not investigated thus preventing comparison of the differences between effects of online and inperson social support on depressive symptoms simultaneously and their gender differences second the research data relied on selfreport measures which may be affected by social desirability or selfcognitive bias further research could use data from big data mining to provide more solid evidence third this study adopts a crosssectional research paradigm which cannot confirm the causal relationship between variables in fact the relation between online social support and selfesteem maybe bidirectional shchebetenko  indicated that both positive and negative selfesteem can encourage users to engage in online social networking therefore longitudinal studies and crosslag analysis or experimental designs should be used in further research this study examined the relationship and underlying mechanism between online social support and depressive symptoms results demonstrated that selfesteem mediated the relationship between online social support and depressive symptoms and gender moderated the indirect relationship between them specially the indirect effect of online social support on depressive symptoms was only significant in the male group rather than in the female

Research paper_Journal article,VXXJA_1.docx,Research paper_Journal article,VXXJA_1.docx,crispri induced suppression of hypothetical reverse transcriptase gene  pa in p aeruginosaan approach to inhibit microbial infectionsreverse transcriptase in prokaryotes is not generally considered to be necessary for the survival and reproduction of individuals however recent studies have challenged this widely accepted concept and reverse transcriptase is involved in the hosts immune defense system against phages despite the incipient importance of reverse transcriptase whether it is implicated in a broader role in bacterial growth replication motility and antibiotic resistance has not been reported we focused on the pa gene  a hypothetical reverse transcriptase gene whose function has not been explored  which is located within the known pf prophage gene island of   p aeruginosa and may assume a more significant biological function efficient and controlled manipulation of gene expression rates is an important method for probing gene function here we report that inhibition of  p aeruginosa pa can have an effect equivalent to that of the mutant a crispr interference crispri system was developed to suppress the expression of  p aeruginosa genes specificallywe cloned the crisprdcassgrna system targeting pa into the shuttle vector pherdt containing an arabinose inducible promoter to determine whether to repress the target gene in an arabinose inducible manner through a series of experiments we found that inhibition of pa forced  p aeruginosa to grow slower be less motile be sensitive to antibiotics produce less chlorophyll form fewer biofilms and be less virulent in an animal model of infection to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which pa regulates the vital activity of  p aeruginosa we compared highthroughput rnaseq in bacterial cells with and without crisprimediated pa inhibition rnaseq showed that inhibition of pa dramatically altered the transcriptional profile of  p aeruginosa resulting in significant differential expression of  genes we identified many downstream targets of pa including genes related to amino acid ketone body sugar and organic salt metabolism unexpectedly five genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation were lowly expressed after target gene inhibition indicating the hitherto unrecognized importance and profound significance of pa in the growth metabolism of  p aeruginosa genomewide transcriptome analysis enabled the identification of functions that pa controls and regulates but cannot manifest through phenotypes and traits this work is a fundamental but not unimportant step toward a comprehensive understanding of the involvement of reverse transcriptase in the regulatory network underlying prokaryotes our findings identify previously untrodden functions of pa and clarify the position of reverse transcriptase in prokaryotic survival and reproduction which is critical for understanding the origin and evolution of reverse transcriptase and guiding the treatment of  p aeruginosa infectionsin the summer of  reverse transcriptase its more academic name rnadependent dna polymerasewas independently reported by temin and mizutaniand baltimore reverse transcriptase appears to be commonplace in retroviruses and it is usually considered as the core enzyme necessary for the latter to reproduce offspring the discovery of reverse transcriptase in prokaryotes brings up several troubling issues including its origin and evolution and what role it plays in microorganisms reverse transcriptase in bacteria seems to be dispensable however the study by adi millman and colleagues cautions against the assumptions that this nonessential and awkward status will always extend to all reverse transcriptasestheir work on the biological function of retrons implies that reverse transcriptase unites ncrna and one or two proteins that act as effectors to form a complex called retrons which is essential for bacterial resistance to phage invasion more properties of retrons are yet to be elucidated in the future but reverse transcriptase is certainly indispensable in prokaryotes further research will provide new avenues for a broader understanding of reverse transcriptasehere we have selected a gene of unknown function in pao as the subject of our study this strain is of interest because its genetic complexity is close to that of simple eukaryotes where reverse transcriptase represented by telomerase has been revealed to be of great importance for life in fact the  p aeruginosa genome contains approximately  genes which is significantly larger than the vast majority of bacterial genomes studying the reverse transcriptase of  p aeruginosa can provide new information about interspecies evolution ecological diversity bioinformatics analysis showed that the product of pa contains a reverse transcriptase structural domain suggesting that it may participate in the mobilome as part of a retrons or retrotransposon in the  p aeruginosa genome pa is located within the pf prophage gene island which is a fascinating location in general during the coevolution of bacteria and phages lysogenic phages insert their nucleic acids into the genome of hosts this foreign nucleic acid is usually thought to survive as a selfish retrotransposable element and to be in a dormant state waiting to be awakened however given the prevalence of this phenomenon it is not surprising that exogenous nucleic acids can also have occasional effects on the host although the functional importance of prokaryotic reverse transcriptases is increasingly recognized it is still a technical challenge to accurately interrogate their functions the challenge ahead of microbiologists is how to fill this gapclustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crisprassociated nucleasecrisprcas is an adaptive immune system of bacteria that eliminates exogenous nucleic acid infections by recognizing and shearing the specific nucleic acid sequence of phagesbased on this property it was developed as crisprcas gene editing technology which contains cas enzymes that act as nucleases and sgrnas that act as guides the associated nuclease of the crisprcas system has been adapted as the most widely used gene editing tool due to the fact that only one cas protein is required unfortunately casmediated provoked doublestrand breaks dsbs in addition to causing gene inactivation can also have unpredictable consequencesthis is unacceptable for the study of prokaryotic essential genes according to reports compared to eukaryotes in the absence of a recombinant template most dsbs in the bacterial genome would be lethal due to the lack of nonhomologous end joining nhejstanley qi et al mutated one amino acid site in each of the hnh and ruvc structural domains in cas causing the mutated cas to lose its ability to shear dna called catalytically dead cas dcasdcas can bind to specific dna targets under the guidance of sgrna and use the spatial site of the protein to block the binding and extension of rna polymerase thus blocking the transcription process and achieving the function of silencing gene expressionthis technology which silences rather than cuts genes to avoid damage to the dna double strand is called crispriwe have previously established a crispri method based on the crisprdcas system in  p aeruginosa and successfully suppressed an essential geneprevious work demonstrated the feasibility of crispri to suppress  p aeruginosa geneshere we proceeded to disrupt the  p aeruginosa pa gene using the identical crispri systemthe vector for crispri in this study was a pherdt plasmid containing an arabinose promoter arabinose induces the plasmid to express dcas which in turn silences the target gene while glucose has the opposite effectthe schematic design and construction of the crispri system is shown in figure an ideal sgrna target should satisfy the following three principles first a ngg motif pam sequence should be present and located at of the nt target sequence second the target site is close to the atg region start codon coding sequence thirdthe selected sequence remains unique and specific in the pao genomean sgrna expression sequence and the dcas gene were inserted into the pherdt plasmid vector respectively the key point is that the dcas gene is located downstream of the pbad promoter pherdt is an arabinose inducible vector based on pucpt that supports replication in pseudomonas aeruginosait shares the characteristics of the pucp vector family however in comparison with the latter the advantage of the pherdt vector is that the gene inserted into the plasmid remains in a low expression state when pbadpromote is not induced in the presence of arabinose dcas obtained moderate levels of expression the expression of dcas however was reduced to very low levels or even completely inhibited in the absence of arabinose or in the presence of glucose the kinetics of arabinose induction and glucose repression effects are very rapid rather than changing the altered temperature but using this system that can be turned on and off quickly and efficiently allows us to study important aspects of p aeruginosa gene function in a very simple wayit is essential to be familiar with the location and position of pa in the genome in order to be able to understand the importance of this gene the genomic position of pa in strain pao is located at     strand the bioinformatics analysis of its products is shown in figure  fifteen reverse transcriptases that have been characterized were selected along with pa proteins to construct an evolutionary treeevolutionary tree shows that the pa product is a member of a superfamily of reverse transcriptasesfigure aaccording to ncbi predictions the protein product of gene pa as expected has a highly conserved reverse transcriptase structural domain between amino acid residues the presence of a highly conserved nucleic acid binding site and an ntp binding site in the structural domain of presence of the protein suggests that the reverse transcription effectfigure bcomparison of the pa protein sequence with a group ii intron reverse transcriptase showed strong similarity in the tertiary structure of the formed protein similar to the latter the pa product forms binding sites for deoxyadenosine triphosphate and magnesium ion ligands at the same positions this is suggested by the conserved residues of bothfigure cweblogo sequence marker provides multiple sequence comparisons for  reverse transcriptases including pa it can quickly reveal important features of the comparisons and produces more accurate and richer sequence similarity descriptions for indistinguishable sequences taking advantage of this feature we found that most of the amino acid residues of these proteins are highly conserved in particular residues bound to nucleic acids showed complete identityfigure dthe growth curves of pao grown in arabinose or glucose containing medium are givenfigure a measurement of bacterial absorbance over time showed that in the arabinose environment the logarithmic phase of pao was smoother and it entered the late logarithmic phase earlier the decrease in absorbance when the stable phase was reached was also fully in line with expectationsno significant difference in the lag phase was observed between the two groups suggesting that pa has no effect on the process by which bacteria enter a new environment and begin to divide and proliferate in a nutrientrich environment this could be attributed to the fact that this gene is not much associated with the accumulation of growth metabolism related enzymes during this processthe growth kinetic curves showed that pa had an impact on the growth of the pao population under experimental conditions when the bacteria multiplied to a certain extentwe examined whether pa is involved in the process of flagellar and mycorrhizal hair formation the flagellum or type iv hairs mediated by different motility and chemotaxis in different environments include swimming swarming and twitching motility swimming is the motion of individual bacterial cells in a liquid environment or in an environment with high water content driven by flagella and is an individual behavior swarming is a way for bacteria to move in a semisolid environment in a coordinated manner between colonies it is the coordinated movement between groups of bacteria in a semisolid environment requiring the participation of flagella and bacterial hairs and rhamnolipid surfactant bacterial cells rely on the extension and contraction of type iv hairs to move on surfaces with less water content called twitching the swimming swarming and twitching of pao were examined to investigate whether the flagella and hairs of   p aeruginosa were affected by pa the results showed that all three of these motility and chemotaxis were significantly reduced in the pasilenced strain compared to the wild strainfigure bc it shows that pa pseudomonas aeruginosa has a positive effect on motility and chemotaxispao was cultured in a defined medium and the resulting chlorophylls were produced with a great variation the strain turned the medium distinctly green after  h in glucosecontaining medium while it remained only light green in arabinose medium figure a the difference in color is due to the different production of  pyocyanin implying that pao produced significantly less pyocyanin after pa was silenced it is known that qs system phenolic resin production gene phzag gene phzm and oxidation state in  p aeruginosa all participate in the production of pyocyanin and endow the culture medium with obvious bluegreen color interestingly our transcriptome analysis showed that the enrichment involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway was most pronounced among all downregulated genes these results suggest that pa is required for pyocyanin production in paosilent mutant of pa reduced pao motility produced less chlorophyll and downregulated oxidative phosphorylationrelated genes flagellarmediated swimming type iv hairmediated rubbing chlorophyll and oxidative phosphorylation are known to be involved in biofilm formation we assume that the biofilm formed by this strain is also reduced to verify this hypothesis we investigated the role of pa in biofilm formationin control experiments  p aeruginosa cells were grown in glucose medium and a thick chitinous biofilm was foundthe biofilm formed in the natural environment is clear and complete in appearance and evenly distributed which is the normal morphology of biofilmhowever in arabinose containing medium the morphology of the biofilm formed at the bottom of the well plate was significantly changed and the biofilm formed by bacterial cells was significantly disrupted and unstablefigure b we further quantified the biofilms of the two groups after biofilm dissolution in  ethanol the absorbance of the two groups had a significant differencefigure c based on these results we conclude that pa inhibition effectively inhibits biofilm formation which eliminates the basis for  p aeruginosa pathogenicitybacterial resistance depends not only on the presence of antibiotic resistance genes but also on the upstream regulation that determines whether and how much of these genes are expressed the biofilm defects caused by the silence of pa suggested that it might promote the weakened resistance of pao to antibioticswe thus examined the susceptibility of pao to piperacillin ciprofloxacin amikacin and azithromycin in arabinose environment which are representative of penicillin antibiotics thirdgeneration quinolones antibacterial drugs aminoglycoside antibiotics and macrolide antibiotics respectively the mic of these antibiotics was quantitatively evaluated against wildtype and silent strains table  the silent mutant exhibited significantly lower mics to ceftazidime piperacillin ciprofloxacin and amikacin compared to the wild type suggesting that pa has an irreplaceable presence in the antibiotic resistance of  p aeruginosa however no differences were observed between  p aeruginosa in the presence of azithromycin indicating that exposure to this antibiotic did not affect the growth of the strain suggesting that pa is not involved in regulating the natural resistance of  p aeruginosa to azithromycin transcriptome analysis suggested that  genes in biosynthesis of antibiotics pathway were significantly downregulated after pa was repressed which is consistent with the results of our antibiotic sensitivity assaysilencing of pa reduced motility the key virulence factor chlorophylin and biofilm formation in  p aeruginosa this correlation suggests that pa may contribute to the overall virulence of the bacteria to assess the extent to which pa affects bacterial virulence effects we used galleria mellonella larvae a model system for testing infectious bacterial virulence the larvae were injected with  l of diluted culture containing  strains larval survival was assessed at     and  hours postinjection figure  at  hours postinfection the larval survival rate of the silent mutant injected was  and that of the wildtype strain injected was  by  hours the survival rate of larvae injected with the silent mutant had decreased to  and all the larvae injected with the wildtype died these data indicate the important role of pa in the virulence of  p aeruginosaour work on bacterial phenotypes demonstrates the key contribution of pa to the freeliving and rapid reproduction of  p aeruginosabased on these unexpected findings it is reasonable to assume that this gene assumes additional functions to characterize the extent to which pa deletion affects overall gene expression in pao we decided to perform transcriptome sequencingtranscript levels of a total of  genes were altered fold change fc  or   fdradjusted pvalue   in pao cells in medium containing  arabinose compared to the control with  glucose added a total of  genes were downregulated while  were upregulatedvolcano plot shows the significance of differential gene expression with fold changes figure a a list of down and upregulated genes associated with the phenotype is shown and most of these extremely variable genes are involved in important metabolic over in bacteria table further functional classification of all differential genes was performed using the go database go annotated classified degs showed that pseudomonas aeruginosa regulated by pa is enriched for cellular components and biological processesfigure b enrichment analysis of the biological process ontology terms of  upregulated genes revealed associations with oxidationreduction processes transmembrane transport and lipid metabolism for the molecular function ontological terminology the main go terms represented are coenzymebinding agents oxidoreductase activity and cofactor bindingrelated pathways unexpectedly none of the upregulated genes were associated with cellular componentsfigure c we showed more interest in downregulated genes among the  downregulated genes we found that most of them focused on the organic nitrogen complex biotin cellular metabolic process and cellular process pathways which represent an important regulatory position of pa in bacterial metabolismfigure d all  above mentioned enrichment pathways are mainly involved in important physiological processes such as metabolism environmental information processing and genetic information processing of cellular processesanalysis of the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg pathway database to identify additional signal transduction pathways all differential genes were assigned to  major pathwaysfigure a  upregulated genes were assigned to the kegg pathwayfigure bamino acid metabolism especially the valine leucine and isoleucine degradation pathways enriched the most differentially expressed genes and showed high levels of significance synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies pathway exhibited the highest enrichment factor values among these enrichment pathways notably amino acids and ketone bodies are important substrates or end products of protein and fat metabolism respectively in addition propanoate metabolism butanoate metabolsm and starch and sucrose metabolism were identified as important enrichment pathways gene enrichment suggests that pa may interfere with the metabolic processes of proteins lipids sugars and organic salts in  p aeruginosa furthermore we found that among all downregulated genes the oxidative phosphorylation pathway was the most enriched followed by protein export purine metabolism and the citric acid cycle tca cycle figure c rtqpcr of six important regulatory genes from tss exos and pcrv and qs lasi lasr rhli and rhlr systems were selected to validate the transcriptome sequencing results in order to improve the reliability of the analysis all selected differential genes c showed the same trend expression pattern between rnaseq and rtqpcr resultsfigure dthese data suggest that pa may be regulating respiration and important biochemical metabolic processes to participate in important functions of bacteriagenes encoding reverse transcriptase remain poorly represented in prokaryotic genome annotations in large part because reverse transcription in prokaryotes is considered to be an irrelevant process evidence based on biochemical methodology and bioinformatics suggests that prokaryotes contain numerous reverse transcriptases however the vast majority have not been functionally verified and characterized here we have identified and characterized the function of a conserved putative reverse transcriptase in  p aeruginosa that serves as an important regulator of essential gene expression in bacteria through direct or indirect global effects in light of more than  years of attention to the central law it is interesting to consider that the key regulators of reverse transcriptase involved in the reverse transcription process within prokaryotes have surprisingly not been discoveredin this study we report the adoption of arabinose induction to silence a gene of unknown function in  p aeruginosa pao we show that pa  whose product is predicted to be a reverse transcriptase gene  has implications for  p aeruginosa it was observed that not only the quantity of pao but also its quality was significantly affected in the arabinose environment this alteration may be comprehensive it was first observed that the bacterial growth curve was affected by the inhibition of pa indicating that the rate of propagation of offspring was limited however it is important to emphasize that this limitation is not unlimited pa is not a distinct pathway that allows  p aeruginosa to acquire the ability to proliferate in fact it is now clear that pa is blocked as a pathway involved in promoting cell division and  p aeruginosa is still able to continue to proliferate through various pathways motility and chemotaxis observations demonstrate a significant decrease in swimming swarming and twitching motility after pa inhibition this represents a low expression of surface hairs and flagella low adhesion and hydrophobicity and a defective chemotaxis response leading to reduced motility implying that pa shows a modified expression of regulatory genes involved in initiating motility and chemotaxis formation pyocyanin biofilm and drug resistance are three inseparable phenotypes in  p aeruginosa capacity to produce the phenazine electrochemically active metabolite pyocyanin allows  p aeruginosa to participate in a variety of important biological activities including maintaining bacterial cellular fitness biofilm formation and acting virulently within host tissues biofilm is an integral organizational structure of the bacterial community representing the participation of microorganisms in various life processes as a community rather than as individuals exogenous antibiotics are often unable to completely kill bacteria because of the presence of biofilm p aeruginosa is highly susceptible to multidrug resistant strains and can be insensitive to a variety of antibiotics belonging to different classes especially carbapenems aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones in our study it was clearly found that pao strains were more sensitive to these three classes of antibiotics after pa inhibition which suggested us to use this gene as a target for developing new drugsin parallel synergistic interactions between drug resistance and biofilms are more biologically relevant in bacteria therefore the relative expression patterns of how these three phenotypes are affected by pa remain to be further determined however we were still able to determine the effect of pa on the virulence factor of  p aeruginosa this was again demonstrated by the greater wax borer infection model however it was still possible to determine the effect of pa on the virulence factor of  p aeruginosa this was again demonstrated by galleria mellonella larvae infection model in vivothe last remaining key question is how pa managed to be involved in regulating such a wide range of life activity processes in  p aeruginosa collectively two hypotheses are considered the first one is that pa acts as a reverse transcriptase to synthesize different kinds of dna strands and the abundance of the latter provides different signaling pathways secondly reverse transcriptase acts as an integral physiological process in  p aeruginosa the latter hypothesis is supported by transcriptome sequence results analysis of the kegg pathway database indicated that the oxidative phosphorylation pathway was most enriched among all downregulated genes in view of the importance of the oxidative respiratory chain in participating in microbial substance metabolism and energy conversion  the discovery that pa regulates oxidative phosphorylation opens up interesting possibilities for the function of reverse transcriptase taking into account that the inhibition of pa has an allencompassing effect on  p aeruginosa it is interesting to speculate that a direct method of disrupting the oxidative respiratory chain may have a similar effect a hypothesis is compelled to suggest that pa is acting through an extremely important oxidative pathway to  p aeruginosa and thus influencing metabolism although reverse transcription and oxidative phosphorylation are two seemingly unrelated processes this possibility is valid without considering unpredictable signaling pathwaysin conclusion the efficient combination of bacterial phenotype and transcriptome by using the efficient gene silencing technology crispri allowed us to predict the essential functions of p aeruginosa pa in an unbiased manner it accurately determined the involvement of the gene in motility adhesion population sensing cell death cytoplasmic division pyocyanin and drug resistance and demonstrated the role of regulatory virulence factors in vivo experiments our observations reinforce the link between reverse transcriptase and basic bacterial life activities however the catalog of downstream pathways potentially affected by disrupted pa and how they are affected by pa may be far from complete thus further work is almost certainly needed to understand the full mechanistic basis of the effects we observed it should still be emphasized however that the functional characterization of pa as a previously unrecognized reverse transcriptase suggests that the reverse transcriptase process is to a large extent not only a complement of the central dogma but also a repository representing future biological insightssee table  for a comprehensive list of

consequently we discovered that mirp was possibly involved in the development of ad indeed we confirmed the association between nrn and mirp expression in ad mouse models in addition we catalogued changes in the cognitive capacity and mirp and nrn levels in appps mice notably our results revealed a previously undefined mechanism wherein mirp plays a significant role in ad development by inhibiting the expression of the target protein nrnalzheimers disease ad is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of amyloid  plaques and neurofibrillary tangles eventually it causes progressive cognitive and memory impairment  owing to its complex pathobiological characteristics accurate early diagnostic biomarkers and effective therapeutic options remain to be determined in ad detection and treatment  neuritin nrn also known as candidate plasticity gene  is a neurotrophic factor  that plays multiple roles in neural development including neuronal plasticity and regeneration   recently it was speculated to be associated with cognitive function loss and is possibly a potential therapeutic target for ad  however its mechanism of action in neurodegenerative diseases remains unclearincreasingly developed bioinformatics approaches have broadened the significance of microrna mirna research particularly in target gene prediction and target site accessibility  studies have confirmed that mirna dysregulation is critical to the development of several diseases  thus dysregulated mirnas are also possible biomarkers of ad progression here we identified mirnas upregulated in ad from literature and ad datasets and clustered them thereafter we performed bioinformatics analysis to predict nrntargeting mirnas consequently we discovered an association between mirp and nrn expression in ad mouse models ie appps mice we also established an association between the cognitive working memory capacity of appps mice and the altered levels of mirp and nrn our results revealed a previously undefined mechanism wherein mirp is key to the development of ad as it inhibits the expression of the target protein nrnall animal experiments were performed in strict accordance with the institutional animal care and use committee guidelines and were approved by the animal ethical committee of hangzhou normal university hangzhou chinawe purchased appswepse appps doubletransgenic ad mice and agematched bc hybrid genetic wildtype wt mice from the animal model center of nanjing university nanjing china they were housed into samesex groups and kept on a regular diet and under a  lightdark cycle in a specific pathogen free laboratory animal environmental facilities food and tap water were provided ad libitum both the appps ad and wt control mice were divided into three age cohorts at experiment onset   and  months of age they were subjected to a fear conditioning test at  and  months of age and were euthanized at   and  months respectively for hippocampal and cortex tissue extraction from the brainwe isolated total rna from the extracted hippocampus and cortex using the sanperp column microrna extraction kit sangon  and cdna was synthesized from this extracted rna using the revertaid premium reverse transcriptase thermo scientific  the cdna were amplified using the sg fast qpcr master mix roche  subsequently we assessed nrn expression in the mice hippocampus and cortex by qpcr using the fastking gdna dispelling rt supermix kit tiangen  total rna was extracted and cdna synthesis was performed using trizol reagent invitrogen  according to the manufacturers protocol subsequently we measured the aa ratio and assessed the rna concentration and purity using a nanodrop  expression levels of mirna and genes

and mouse sequences for all the candidate mirna sequences were retrieved from mirbase httpwwwmirbaseorg additionally multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction were performed using emblcluster omega httpwwwebiacuktoolsmsa and the jalveiw softwarefear conditioning fc tests were performed in two chambers panlab le barcelona spain as described previously  a speaker playing continuous background noise  db was attached to one of the stainlesssteel walls of the chambers during the test moreover the stainlesssteel grid floor of the chamber delivered electric foot shocks that the mice could not evade subsequently  and  monthsold appps ad mice n age cohort and agematched wt mice nage cohort were subjected to the complete fc testthis test consisted of the training and test phases that occurred consecutively over  h during the training phase all mice groups were placed in the standard fear conditioning chamber a  cm and were allowed to acclimatize without stimulation for  s subsequently each mouse underwent seven tone cycles  scycle  db and electric foot shocks  s durationcycle  ma which stopped with the tones there was a  s interval between each foot shock the training phase ended with a  s posttraining period following which the mice were returned to their home cages during the test phase mice underwent fc testing for both contextual and cued memories   and  h post the training phase the mice were placed in chamber a without any tone or foot shocks for  min in the contextual recall test in contrast the mice were placed in chamber b  cm with different walls floor smell and light compared to chamber a and were subjected to the same acclimation tones and posttraining period as the training phase without the foot shocks in each phase and test we recorded their freezing behavior defined as the cessation of all movements except respiratory behavior  we also calculated the percentage of time where the mice displayed the freezing behaviors and analyzed the difference in this parameter between the groupswe cultured t cells as described previously  in dulbeccos modified eagles medium sigma  containing  heatinactivated fetal bovine serum biological industries  israel at  c in a  co humidified atmosphere the cells were transfected with mirp mimics or nc mirna and treated for  h these cells were then collected for subsequent experimentswe performed a luciferase activity assay using the dualluciferase reporter assay kit promega usa according to the manufacturers instructions wherein we first seeded t cells in well plates for  h we then divided the cells into three groups that were cotransfected with mirp mimics and promoterluciferase constructs normal control plucnc mirp mimics and plucneuritin mutant plucmutneuritin or mirp mimics and plucneuritin this cotransfection was performed using lipofectamine  invitrogen  as per the manufacturers instructions luciferase activity was analyzed  h post transfection using the dualluciferase reporter assay system statistical analyses were performed using graphpad  while differences between two groups were evaluated by oneway analysis of variance multiple comparisons were performed by post hoc ttests all values are presented as the mean  standard deviation and statistical significance was set at pthe mrna and protein expression levels of nrn in the hippocampus and cortex of  and monthsold appps mice were evaluated by qrtpcr and western blotting fig  our qrtpcr results revealed that the appps mice had lower nrn mrna expression in their hippocampus than the wt mice in fact this expression was lowest in months old appps mice p fig a similarly we observed that  and monthsold appps mice exhibited significantly lower nrn protein expression in their hippocampus than the agematched wt mice p fig c d however mrna expression of nrn did not differ among the mice cortices of each age group fig b additionally hippocampus of monthold appps mice and wt mice did not have differing nrn protein expression levels fig a c d remarkably nrn was downregulated in the hippocampus of monthsold appps mice as presented in fig a and b we identified  and  upregulated mirnas in gse and gse respectively notably we obtained two candidate mirnas mir and mir by overlapping the upregulated mirnas fig c further search for candidate mirnas targeting the untranslated region utr of nrn helped us identify    and  overlapping mirnas from targetscan mirbd dianamicrot and mirwalk respectively fig d accordingly we selected seven nrntargeting mirnas as the candidate mirnassubsequently we performed multiple sequence alignment and homology analyses of the candidate mirnas from different species fig e notably our constructed phylogenetic tree demonstrated the homology between human and mouse sequences of mirp and mirp fig f green text furthermore global alignment of mmumirp with hsamirp sequences revealed them to be identical fig gvariations in the candidate mirna mirp and nrn expression levels in the appps mouse hippocampusour evaluation of mirp expression in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of  and monthsold appps mice revealed that mirp was highly expressed in the hippocampus of monthsold mice p fig a in addition our assays demonstrated that monthsold appps mice had higher mirp expression than  and monthsold appps mice and the wt mice fig c however mirp expression was hardly significant in the cerebral cortex of either the appps mice or wt mice fig b furthermore we determined by western blotting that nrn protein expression was lower in monthsold appps mice than that in the wt mice p fig d ewe performed fc tests for  and monthsold appps and wt mice fig a consequently we observed that freezing of the mice during foot shock administration hardly differed between the genotypes and age groups fig b this suggested that the appps and wt mice exhibited comparable initial responses to experimental stimuli freezing time analysis in the test phase revealed that  and monthsold appps mice had lower freezing time during contextual fear memory conditioning than agematched wt mice statistical differences were observed at  and  h after the training phase fig c e in contrast a significant reduction in freezing time was observed during cued fear memory conditioning in appps mice of different ages compared to that in wt mice fig d f the overall performance of the mice in this test revealed a significant decline in the cognitive capacity  months onwards in appps micewe validate the interaction between mirp and nrn using luciferase reporter constructs containing the utr of nrn and mutneuritin in t cells fig a b notably utr of nrn had higher luciferase activity than the utr of mutneuritin and the nc control and nc mimics p fig cfurthermore we determined the regulatory role of mirp on nrn expression by transfecting t cells with mirp mimics our western blotting analysis revealed that the nrn protein expression fig d e was significantly lower than nc mimic protein expression p therefore we speculated that mirp downregulates nrn expression by binding to its utr in t cellsneuropathological characteristics of ad a highly heterogeneous condition include amyloid deposition and hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation thus individuals with these pathological biomarkers present with various degrees of cognitive impairment  the neurotrophic factor nrn activated by neurotrophins   is involved in various process including synaptic plasticity   and neurite outgrowth  previously studies have suggested that it protects against adrelated neural and cognitive defects   thus we evaluated its role in ad by comparing its expression levels in the hippocampus of  and monthsold appps mice with that in agematched wt mice fig  we observed that nrn mrna expression in the hippocampus was significantly lower in all the appps mice than that in the wt mice fig a indeed it was lowest in monthsold appps mice this period represents a subclinical or early clinical stage in ad   remarkably nrn protein expression also followed this trend fig c d mirnas are wellestablished as key regulators of neurite outgrowth  dendritic spine morphology  and synaptic plasticity  presently the functions and mechanisms of mirnas in ad are being increasingly recognized and there is evidence of candidate mirnas as biomarkers  we explored the role of mirnas and nrn in the pathogenesis of ad by first identifying and clustering two candidate mirnas that were upregulated in ad fig c secondly we used four different mirna target gene prediction tools and identified seven overlapping candidate mirnas that possibly targeted the utr of nrn fig d next we performed multiple sequence alignment fig e and constructed a phylogenetic tree fig f of the candidate mirnas consistent with our previous findings  we discovered mmumirp and hsamirp to have identical sequences indicating that mirp is potentially involved in ad pathogenesis however a study on synaptic and cognitive deficits in xfad mice has demonstrated that mirp restores synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits associated with amediated pathophysiology this needs to be further verified in our research we then validated our bioinformatics results by assessing mirp expression in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of appps mice we found that mirp expression was significantly higher in the hippocampus of monthsold appps mice than that in the wt mice the hippocampus plays an essential role in learning and memory  fig a meanwhile we detected nrn expression in the hippocampus of the same mice group fig d interestingly mirp expression increased with a decrease in nrn expression in the hippocampus of monthsold appps mice fig c e thus altered neuritin and mirp expression levels are possibly associated with the genesis and development of ad the fc test is commonly used to study emotional learning and working memory in mice  owing to the different brain circuitries of cognitive paradigms  we chose contextual and cued memory tests to evaluate the hippocampusdependent  and amygdaladependent  memory of appps mice fig  the freezing times obtained from contextual and cued fear memory conditioning indicated that significant cognitive impairment occurred at  months and lasted until  months in appps mice fig cf notably  shortterm memory fig b p of note the earliest detectable cognitive deficits and neuropathological changes in ad are observed in the hippocampus and are consistent with pathological progression  interestingly we observed that nrn expression decreased upon cognitive impairment whereas mirp expression increased consequently we deduced that mirp possibly regulates nrn expression in the hippocampus of appps micetherefore on the basis of our fc test data we determined the underlying mechanism of mirp by investigating whether mirp regulated nrn expression fig  remarkably mirp significantly inhibited the luciferase reporter of the utr of nrn fig c in fact mirp mimics also significantly inhibited the nrn expression in t cells fig d e thereby suggesting that mirp promotes cognitive impairment by downregulating nrn expression during ad developmentin summary our study revealed a previously undefined mechanism wherein mirp plays a key role in ad development by inhibiting the expression of the target protein nrn these early alterations in the mirna and target protein expression levels in the hippocampus can be regarded as potential biomarkers of ad nonetheless the effect of mirp and nrn on cognitive capacity synaptic plasticity and pathological changes in ad needs to be explored in future studiesacknowledgements the authors would like to thank the animal center

Response to reviewer comments,VZVZS_1.docx,Response to reviewer comments,VZVZS_1.docx,we are resubmitting our original manuscript manuscript number adma entitled ferroelasticferroelectric multiferroicity in van der waals crystal as recommended by the editor the changes and response to all recommendations and criticisms are detailed belowwe hope that this resubmission will now be judged to be satisfactory and we look forward to your editorial decision on its suitability for publicationauthors  jaehun jeong hyeonsik kim gihyeon kwon kwangsik jeong hyangsook lee myunguk park changjun lee sanghyuck yu heegoo kim seongil im kyunghwa yoo eunha lee and mannho chowe thank the reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions concerning our manuscript our response is as followshow about the thickness of the res samples used in this work are they monolayer or few layer i believe the strainmodulated ferroelastic switching would highly dependent on the sample thickness the authors should confirm the thickness of their sample and also study the thickness dependencewe sincerely thank you for having the opportunity to look deeper based on your comment the thickness of res samples used in figures a i and s are about nm as shown in afm data below as you commented the ferroelasticity and the stressstrain behavior of rex cloud be depending on size including thickness like the superelasticity of shape memory alloy nat nanotech    to confirm the effect of thickness on ferroelasticity samples of different thickness but with the same lateral size should be prepared since the lateral size of flake also affect the ferroelasticity however unfortunately it is impossible to prepare such samples using mechanical exfoliation because the lateral size of the flakes cannot be controlled even the thicknesses of most mechanically exfoliated rex flakes are not uniform therefore the detailed research of thickness effect on ferroelasticity will be possible after a method for synthesizing samples of the same size and different thickness is developed in addition there is also problem with quantifying strain although the polymer encapsulation method ensures more efficient strain transfer based on strong adhesion compared to other methods there may be a difference in adhesion according to the thickness of the flake due to a difference in the area of the side since we calculated the strain of flake based on deformation of polymer substrate such difference in strain transfer according to thickness makes it hard to investigate strainstress relation as a function of thickness in conclusion we also wonder about the thickness dependence of ferroelasticity as in your comment but for these reasons we decided that an accurate analysis is difficult at the moment we hope you understand the current situation it is noted that although it is difficult to investigate the ferroelasticity as a function of thickness specifically it is confirmed that the ferroelasticity is also manifested in fewlayer thickness res shown in figure a in addition according to previous reports on the reconstruction references  acs nano     adv sci     sci adv   eabc it can be expected that the ferroelasticity in rex is maintained even in monolayer limit we supplemented the information about thicknesses of flakes in method sectionthe thicknesses of flakes used for photovoltaic effect and tem measurement are about  nm and under nm respectivelypiezoresponse force microscopy pfm is a powerful tool for studying the switchable ferroelectric polarization in d systems so i suggest the authors should perform the pfm analysis to demonstrate the ferroelectricity polarization in reswe sincerely thank you for having the opportunity to investigate deeper based on your comment we performed the inplane pfm to directly confirm the ferroelectric polarization in res as shown in figure s below the inplane pfm phase and amplitude clearly show the ferroelectric domains which has same configuration of ferroelastic domains observed in figure sb furthermore from the opposite inplane pfm phases of domains with different orientation states it can be verified that the spontaneous polarization as well as the spontaneous strain are simultaneously switched by external strain therefore we can conclude that van der waals res possess ferroelasticferroelectric multiferroicity to provide direct evidence of ferroelasticferroelectric multiferroicity we have supplemented figure s and revised manuscript as followsfigure s ferroelectric domains in res ae om a pom b topography c

afm system cypher asylum research using dual ac resonance tracking inplane pfm mode for reading bipolar ferroelectric domain patterns a conductive cantilever coated with pt  ir pppefm nanosensor was used for the pfm measurement to ignore the contribution of electrostatic force to the pfm signals the measurement was performed at higherharmonic resonance frequency near  mhz figure ef it seems that the res domain was shorten and widen after ferroelastic domain switching is it right figure sb why domain  and domain  in stem image show obvious brightness contrast but that was not observed in domain  and domain  please give reasonable interpretationfirst the flake size in the raman mapping data can be subtly different from the actual flake size due to the spatial resolution of the raman mapping even though raman mapping data in figures e and f were obtained for the same res flake furthermore the focus of the laser or alignment of the sample can exacerbate such problem for this reason the res domain sizes in figures e and f can be different even though raman mapping data were measured for the same flakes however such problem does not interfere with representing the ferroelastic switching of res second the diffraction intensity and consequent brightness of stem images can be changed according to direction of crystal and alignment of sample therefore in figure a and sb domains with different crystal directions are distinguished based on brightness contrast meanwhile we obtained figure c and sa where the zone axes of domains  and  coincide as much as possible to clearly confirm the structures of both domains at the same time as a result the brightness of domains are looks almost identical to provide a explanation regarding this subject we revised the caption of figure s figure s unfiltered stem image a b atomic scale stem image of  twin boundary between domains  and  a and between domains  and  b the brightness contrast of domain  and  in b comes from the

reconstruction references  acs nano     adv sci     sci adv   eabc it can be expected that the ferroelasticity in rex is maintained even in monolayer limit in addition to size of flake the stacking order may also affect the ferroelasticity for example in the case of bilayer rex with ab stacking configuration demonstrated in acs photonics    initial orientation states of upper layer and lower layer are different and consequently orientation states after ferroelastic switching are also different in this paper we used rex crystals with the most stable stacking configuration we supplemented the information about thicknesses of flakes in method sectionthe thicknesses of flakes used for photovoltaic effect and tem measurement are about  nm and under nm respectivelythe authors mentioned as the other possible origins of photovoltaic effect ie straingradientinduced flexoelectricity anisotropic absorption and difference in bandgap lead the opposite isc at the two tbs they can be excluded can the authors provide further elaborations the photovoltaic effect induced by flexoelectricity anisotropic absorption and difference in bandgap lead isc at the boundary where the strain absorption and bandgap change respectively the scheme of mechanism and resulting photocurrent are shown in figure s below in the case of flexoelectricity driven photovoltaic effect electric polarization induced by strain gradient generate photocurrent in the case of anisotropic absorption driven photovoltaic effect difference in photocarrier concentration due to anisotropic light absorption generate photocurrent through diffusion current in the case of difference in bandgap driven photovoltaic effect band bending generate photocurrent through drift current the most important issue here is that these effects drive isc only at domain boundaries for example recently reported flexophotovoltaic effect in mos nat nanotechnol    shows the current peaks with opposite signs at both edges where giant strain gradients are found therefore we exclude them from the origin of the photovoltaic effect observed in figure j to provide a more detailed explanation regarding this subject we have supplemented figure s and reference  to revised manuscript figure s other possible origins of photovoltaic effect a flexoelectricity driven photovoltaic effect electric polarization induced by strain gradient may manifest photovoltaic effect b anisotropic absorption driven photovoltaic effect difference in photocarrier concentration due to anisotropic light absorption may generate photocurrent through

the title of manuscript to ferroelasticferroelectric multiferroicity in van der waals rhenium dichalcogenides to specify the materials of investigationsi looked but could not find the thickness of the flakes being exfoliated what is d about this and was this studied as a function of layer thicknesswe sincerely thank you for having the opportunity to look deeper based on your comment the thickness of res samples used in figures a i and s used in this paper are about nm as shown in afm data below regarding the ferroicity the discovery of d ferroics with layered structure is highly required as nanofabrication is gradually becoming important since ferroicity in d materials is maintained even in nanoscale thickness in contrast to d ferroics science    nature    these advantage in thickness scaling comes from d nature of layered structure likewise the ferroelasticity is also manifested in fewlayer thickness res shown in figure a in addition according to previous reports on reorientation domain references  acs nano     adv sci     sci adv   eabc it can be expected that ferroelasticity in rex is maintained even in monolayer thickness therefore we can consider multiferroicity in rex as

we supplemented the information about thicknesses of flakes in method section the thicknesses of flakes used for photovoltaic effect and tem measurement are about  nm and under nm respectivelyt t t are all nondescriptive labels for phaseswhat are the point and space groups of these phasesare they polar we sincerely thank you for having the opportunity to look deeper based on your comment in bulk form the space point groups of t t and t are known as     and   respectively therefore we can estimate that rhenium dichalcogenides with t  phase are not polar due to the presence of inversion symmetry however interestingly the crystal symmetry in van der waals materials can be changed by stacking order and consequent distortions recently such variation of structure and resulting new physical properties which are not manifested in bulk form are largely studied the typical example is ferroelectricity in abstacked boron nitride although the bilayer hbn hexagonal boron nitride crystal with aa stacking order is nonpolar due to inversion symmetry the abstacked bilayer bn is polar and ferroelectric references  science     science    in the case of res according to the previous study on thickness dependent second harmonic generation shg signal in res reference  light sci appl    the inversion symmetry breaks down owing to interlayer stacking order in few layers res therefore we predicted that the fewlayer rhenium dichalcogenides are polar and verified it experimentally to provide more details regarding the structure we revised manuscript as followsfor example in wte and mote with regard to group  tmds the transition from octahedral t  to distorted octahedral t  structure induces ferroelectricity  as well as nontrivial topological properties in the same manner another type of the distorted octahedral t  structure with a diamondchain dc structure formed with the four transitionmetal atom clusters linked with bridge bonds is observed in group  tmds eg res resemultiferroicity is typically used for magnetism plus ferroelectricity at least in the common usage now if one insists on calling a ferroelectric plus ferroelastic a multiferroic then most bulk ferroelectrics will also be multiferroics and the term loses any special meaning i would remove multiferroic label ferroic properties are typically classified into four types of primary ferroic orders ferroelasticity ferroelectricity ferromagnetism and ferrotoroidicity by the symmetry of their order parameters based on this classification hans schmid who coined the term multiferroic defined multiferroics as the materials that unite two or more primary ferroic states in the same phase ferroelectrics  vol  pp accordingly materials having both ferromagnetic and ferroelectric properties are a subset of multiferroic materials and materials having both ferroelasticity and ferroelectricity phys rev b    or materials having both ferroelasticity and ferromagnetism appl phys lett    are also included in multiferroic materials therefore we used the term multiferroic to describe the coexistence of ferroelasticity and ferroelectricity in rhenium dichalcogenides based on definition of

Research paper_Journal article,WJUJL_4.docx,Research paper_Journal article,WJUJL_4.docx,longterm changes in dietary quality and patterns from young to middle adulthood according to labresult based diabetes awareness cardiathe benefits and significance of healthy eating behavior in young adulthood are well documented  for instance adults who consumed better diet quality in adolescence or young adulthood were less likely to gain excess weight during the young adulthood which may protect them from earlyonset diabetes  high quality plantcentered diet and limited sugarsweetened beverages ssbs such as soda drinks in adolescence or young adulthood were associated a lower risk of excess weight gain in young adulthood leading to prevent diabetes and its complications later in life  persons who were aware of type  diabetes risk td or newly diagnosed with td consider lifestyle modification such as changing diet as first thing to prevent and manage their diabetes and a shortterm success was observed  however the adoption and integration of healthy eating habits into their daily routine is challenging since many diabetic patients perceive dietary modification to control diabetes as a transition to move tasteless flavorless and hungry diet or abandon normal life    obviously there are unmet nutrition education needs based on disease progression illness perception and stage of behaviors   young adults at risk for and with td may experience more challenges than older adults to adopt healthy eating behaviors since many of them   are shocked and surprised on unexpected health condition and  felt to be a loser       experience asymptomatic diabetes or  unnoticeable complications may not influencing disease perception and sufficient motivation for changing selfcare behaviors yet    are surrounded by prevalent peer norms of unhealthy lifestyle    have inadequate health literacy unrealistic optimism  or poor problem solving skills to engage in lifestyle  modification    confront  tradeoff situations between developmental tasks and lifestyle medication   and  receive stigma against obesity their  body size or td   since td incidence in young adults is increasing an agespecific personcentered nutrition education should be developed and implemented   accumulated research identified that young adults with td are more  vulnerable to hyperglycemic conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state  micro and macrovascular complications and mortality in later life compared to those who develop diabetes at a later age  early nutrition intervention with considerations of patient characteristics eg onset age dietary patterns the stage of change or disease progression is essential to improve health outcomes and quality of life    very limited information however is available to design personcentered nutrition education for young adults at risk for or with td the existing studies are shortterm based qualitative study with small sample size or epidemiological studies have focused on whether foods or dietary patterns predicted future risk of developing diabetes and its complications rather than longterm trajectory in dietary quality and patterns after diabetes awareness     to reduce existing scientific gaps longterm changes in dietary quality and patterns from young to middle adulthood were examined with the coronary artery disease in young adults cardia cohort who engaged in the longitudinal prospective study in young adulthood without diabetes our hypotheses were  poor diet quality in young adulthood leads to incident diabetes   when persons are aware of td they would adopt healthy dietary behaviors demonstrating increased diet quality score consequently their diet quality score at the time of diabetes awareness may be higher than before which may be similar to those without diabetes and  the improved diet quality score may not continue for a longtime though especially in persons who develop td at earlier age since they experience many challenges related to developmental transition and poorer competencies  the findings would help to develop transitional care and dietary interventions for young adults at risk for and with td who are rapidly growing and very vulnerable to many diabetes complicationsthe cardia study is a longitudinal study that began in  with a cohort of  healthy black and white women and men aged  years recruited from four us metropolitan areas after the baseline participants have undergone examination in  cycles to date with the retention rate in the surviving cohort from  in year   through  in year    by study design the sample was approximately similar in size by sex selfdefined race black or white age  years or  years and education high school or high school at each center details of the study design of the cohort have been previously described  the study was approved by institutional review boards at each center and written informed consent was obtained from all study participants for the present study exclusion criteria included having diabetes at the baseline having no diabetes measurements attending fewer than two cardia exams or having implausible energy intake  or  kcald for men and  or  kcald for women the final analysis included  participantsdiet intake was measured during three cardia examinations years   and  using an intervieweradministered diet history which was previously validated  participants were asked about their food and beverage consumption over the previous month under  broad food categories and then were asked to report specific names of foods and beverages that they responded to eat in an openended manner including frequency of consumption unit or serving sizes and preparation methods total energy and nutrient intake were calculated using the nutrition data system for research ndsr university of minnesota minneapolis mnrecorded foods were grouped into  food groups at each test according to the ndsr food group query system and then summarized into  food groups for the purpose of creating an a priori diet quality score apdqs  the apdqs is a hypothesisdriven diet quality index composed of  beneficiallyrated  adverselyrated and  neutrallyrated food groups according to their presumed influence on cardiovascular diseases cvd individuals with higher apdqs scores consumed more nutritionallyrich plant foods and consumed less highfat red processed meats and unhealthy plant foods the apdqs also encompass subsets of animalbased products eg lowfat dairy and nonfried fish and poultry see supplemental figure  the apdqs has been epidemiologically validated for its predictability for obesity diabetes impaired renal function myocardial infarction and mortality     the total apdqs ranged from  to  which were calculated by summing subcomponent scores based on quintile scale scores  to  points for beneficiallyrated and  to  points for adverselyrated food groups zero points for neutrallyrated food groups higher score indicates better quality of diet incident diabetes was defined as having one of the following criteria throughout year  for the first time fasting glucose  mgdl twohour h post load glucose  mgdl in the oral glucose tolerance test measured at years   and  glycated hemoglobin hbac   mmolmol at year  and year  andor selfreported antidiabetic medication use per medication bottle brought to clinic selfreported cases with normal or missing glucose values and no antidiabetic medications were not included of persons with diabetes further classification was conducted for the current study according to diabetes awareness based on screendetected incident diabetes  never diabetes group who had no diabetes throughout  year observation period  earlyaware group who were aware of diabetes at or before year   middleaware group who were unaware of diabetes at year  but become aware of it at year   or  and  lateraware group who found their diabetes after year   since majority of cardia participants found their diabetes during the cardia exams only a few cases who were diagnosed with td by outside of doctors were included in the current study age sex race education smoking family history including parental history of diabetes were selfreported packyear of smoking was computed by multiplying the number of packs smoked each day by the number of years the person had smoked physical activity level was obtained from a validated intervieweradministered cardia physical activity history questionnaire  which asked about how often they engaged in  moderate or vigorousintensity physical activities over the previous year the overall physical activity score was computed by adding the weighted products of all activities frequency in months x intensity of activity and represented in exercise units eu height and weight were measured to the nearest  pound by trained professionals bmi was calculated by dividing the weight in kilograms by the height in meters squared kgm to examine the impact of diabetes complications or comorbidity on dietary behaviors comparisons on diseaserelated variables ie hypertension dyslipidemia retinopathy neuropathy depression by  groups was conducted see supplemental table  baseline characteristics of participants were described according to  groups never diabetes group early  vs middlevs later aware groups and tested using chisquare tests for categorical data and ttests for continuous data then a multinomial extension of the casecontrol analytical approach that enables to compare each group was applied all p values shown are tailed with a significance level of p all statistical analyses were performed using sas software version  sas institute inc cary nc to answer hypothesis  the mean value of apdqs and  food groups between never diabetes and ever diabetes group was compared to address whether low diet quality predicted development of diabetes to answer hypotheses  and  the mean levels of apdqs and  food groups at years   and  for  groups were estimated for this the least squares means was computed from the multivariable generalized linear regression models each year separately and the models were adjusted for age sex race maximal educational attainment parental history of diabetes physical activity packyear of smoking total energy intake and bmi additionally possible clinical reasons that modify eating behaviors after diabetes awareness were examined for this the proportion of diabetic complications and depression was examined by  groups at year  the mean age at baseline was  years old   female  black race over year observations  incident diabetes cases were identified  table  shows the characteristics of  groups at years   and  according to diabetes awareness status compared to the never diabetes group ever diabetes group those who developed dm over  years were older lower level of education less physically active and lower consumed energy intakes at the baseline ever diabetes group was also more likely to be black race and had higher parental history of diabetes compared with never diabetes group at year  earlyaware group was the heaviest and showed lowest smoking rate among  groups while they were physically inactive their calorie intake was the lowest as time goes by the differences in calorie intake became statistically insignificant but physical activity became more significant at year  the mean bmis in the ever group increased to obesity level while never group was overweight level  with regard to experiencing diabetic complications and comorbidity earlyaware group showed the highest prevalence among  groups except hypertension middleaware group showed the highest prevalence of hypertension throughout year   see supplemental table   apdqs increased over time while lower apdqs score predicted future diabetes at year  the adpqs was the lowest during the  year observation period and the scores were similar across  groups while the never diabetes group showed the highest score  the mean apdqs for never diabetes and ever diabetes groups were   ci  to  and   ci  to  respectively with a significant difference of   ci  to  at year  they were   ci  to  and   ci  to  with a significant difference of   ci  to  the apdqs at year  was similar between never and ever diabetes groups  figure  shows the apdqs trajectory with mean values se at years   and  according to four groups  at year  the apdqs of the never diabetes group was the highest followed by early middle and lateaware groups while there was no significant difference the apdqs of the earlyaware group increased to a greater degree from year  to year  with a mean difference of about  and had the highest score when they first knew that they had diabetes then the score decreased substantially between years  and  with a mean difference about  having the lowest score at year  similarly the apdqs increased to a higher extent in the middle aware group who knew that they had diabetes at years   or  and reached the highest score at year  in comparison to other groups in contrast the later aware group started with the lowest apdqs at year  and remained the lowest values compared to other groups across all three exams at each exam overall diet quality was influenced by different food groups according to diabetes awareness groups at year  where no one developed diabetes the most important contributors of achieving higher apdqs in the never diabetes than other groups were higher consumption of beneficiallyrated food groups including plant food and coffee and tea  the early aware group in contrast reported the lowest consumption of beneficiallyrated plant food and highest consumption of adversely rated other nondairy beverages  ie soft drinks there were no distinctive differences in the neutralrated food groups figure a and figure a once they were aware of diabetes at year  at year  the earlyaware group significantly increased the consumption of all beneficiallyrated and neutrallyrated foods while they consumed the fewest adverselyrated foods figure b specifically the early aware group increased the consumption of beneficiallyrated and neutrallyrated plant foods and lowfat dairy products of adverselyrated food groups consumption of all food subcomponent categories became decreased in the earlyaware group significant changes of beverage consumption were also observed  they increased beneficiallyrated and neutrallyrated other nondairy beverages such as coffee tea or diet drinks and decreased adverselyrated other nondairy beverages ssbs figure b  at year  the dietary behaviors in earlyaware group seemed to return ones in year  in some aspects they consumed the lowest beneficiallyrated plant food among the groups which was similar to lateraware group beverage selection changed year  however remained at year   while they reported similar scores on all beneficiallyrated foods compared to late aware group they consumed the highest amount of all adverselyrated food groups the most contributor to lead the lowest apdqs was lowest amount of beneficiallyrated plant food and highest amount of adverselyrated meat products figure c bmi which may be a confounder or mediator did not affect the major associations substantially similar changes were observed in middleaware group at year   higher consumption of beneficiallyrated foods plant foods and lower consumption of adverselyrated foods meat products were key contributors to higher apdqs at year  in the middle aware group like earlyaware group at year  there was a change in beverage selection at year  figures c  c  this study revisited a concern about poor quality of diet in young adulthood and potential negative impact on health in the longterm perspectives   accumulating evidence has underscored significant dietary role to prevent and manage td and its complications    in response to research advance nutrition practice guidelines for persons at risk for and with td have evolved over the decades from nutritionbased diet quantityemphasized and onefit all approach to food based diet quality and patterns emphasized and personcentered approach     however prevalence of diabetes especially earlyonset td is increasing and optimal glycemic management rate continues to decline    it is a time to redesign nutrition education content and approaches to make successful translation     hypothesis  that poor diet quality contributes to the development of diabetes was accepted additionally this study added important evidence about why healthy dietary behavior in young adulthood or even adolescence when persons do not develop diabetes yet is important from the longitudinal perspectives and what content should be focused on and when is the best time to deliver education with tailored messages to facilitate healthy behaviors      remaining questions are whether timing of diabetes onset or unhealthy dietary habits influence health to the same degree on diabetes and its complication development or how covariates eg obesity physical inactivity contribute to or prevent from further diabetes progression since our data showed that dietary quality progressively and continuously improved over time while there was an exception ie earlyaware group showed a reduction of dietary quality score from year  to year  also lateraware group consistently had lower dietary quality score over  years and they developed diabetes later despite of continuous poor quality of diet further investigation is necessary  hypothesis  to examine whether diabetes awareness contributes to behavioral modification was accepted once persons were aware of their diabetes they improved quality of diet they tried to consume more beneficiallyrated food eg plant food and less adverselyrated food eg red processed or organ meat the specific dietary patterns however differed by group for instance earlyaware group replaced beverage selection from ssbs ie soda drinks to neutrallyrated other nondairy beverage  ie diet drink or fruit juices right after diabetes awareness and this change remained until year  with regard to middleaware group they tried to consume more the beneficiallyrated plant foods and less drink ssbs like earlyaware group once they were aware of diabetes   however the consumption of adverselyrated meat products did not change much or even slightly increases from year  to year  remaining question is why the consumption of adverselyrated meat product did not change much it may be related to lack of knowledge or selfefficacy on food selection cooking skills food availability or culture depending on the answer different level of interventions eg individual community social or policy level interventions should be considered     because of the translation time lags  lay persons often select another unhealthy behaviors with a hope to select a better nutrition option diet sodas may be a good exemplar  in the current study earlyaware group had the highest score on soda consumption at year  but they switched the beverage selections once they were aware of the diabetes for lateraware group no distinct changes was observed over  years  young adults especially obese ones often drank diet soda to avoid additional calorie intake and added sugar however there is a growing concern about the increased risk for developing td or cvds later in life while evidence is not established yet    continuous research should be done in this area and develop translation strategies to deliver patient centered cuttingedge information without a delay hypothesis  that the improved diet quality score at the time of diabetes awareness may not continue for a longtime especially in persons who develop td at earlier age who confront many developmental challenges and poor problem solving skills was accepted  earlyaware group showed a dramatic improvement on dietary quality in year  the major contributors for this improvements were changes in beneficially or naturallyrated plant foods adverselyrated meat products and adverselyrated other nondairy beverages  however these changes did not last for long time at year  the consumption of adverselyrated meat products and beneficiallyrated plant foods restored almost the same level of year  while changes in beverage remained same like year  for middleaware group there was no change in adverselyrated meat product while they increased beneficiallyrated plant food and decreased adverselyrated other nondairy beverages between year  and year   possible interpretations related to these findings are   middleaware group may significantly decreased the consumption of adverselyrated meat products at the beginning of diabetes awareness but they returned the previous dietary habits over  years which was twice longer than the first observation period  year  to year  which we observed the changes in earlyaware group  there may be a ceiling effect on food selection due to food preference or values unless a person dramatically changes their diet style eg carnivore to vegan or  lay persons may not sufficient empowerment to improve their quality and patterns of diet  even they were aware of a need to change thus they work hard based on their current knowledge and skills to improve dietary behaviors but the efforts are insufficient to improve health outcomes without expert support patientcentered nutrition education with the considerations of their current dietary knowledge attitude preferences cooking skills and behaviors as well as social determinant of health can be a good solution to offer   american diabetes association  proposes four critical time points  ie diagnosis annual checkup developing factors influencing selfcare behavior transition in life and care to deliver diabetes education and support to facilitate healthy eating habits  and  our data supported the recommendation once persons were aware of the diabetes many people wanted to take better options of diet  inaccurate information insufficient skills to practice healthy eating habits or unsupportive environment to select better food options impede their efforts to make actual behaviors which generates  a vicious cycle    for instance higher proportion of earlyaware group experienced comorbidities eg dyslipidemia andor diabetic complications retinopathy neuropathy at year  and made them restored diet quality at the level of year  multiple reasons may explain this phenomenon initially we presumed that the persons would have been less able to get good food have less taste and less interest in and ability to focus on diet  those things might make diet worse  however it turns out that the earlyaware group showed the highest intake of total adverselyrated food groups notably high fat redmeats and wholefat dairy in additional analyses data showed that this group had the highest proportion of having depressive symptoms as defined as  on the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale ceds or taking depression medications diet quality is reduced in persons with depressive and anxiety disorders and  exposure to stress was associated with higher consumption of unhealthy foods thus psychological support and policy and systemlevel interventions in addition to nutrition education should be considered for persons with diabetes especially who developed diabetes at earlier age   multidisciplinary team approach is a key to make successful implementation and dissemination of patientcentered nutrition education   despite the significance and innovation of the current study as the first study to examine the longitudinal changes in dietary quality and patterns after the diabetes awareness there are some limitations first only small number of participants were classified as earlyaware group which decrease the power second data collection intervals were inconsistent which make a difficulty to accurately interpret the changes of dietary patterns by group  eg we do not know whether middleaware group reduced the consumption of adverselyrated meat products right after the awareness but restored it to previous level at year  lastly we were unable to observe the change of dietary quality and patterns in lateraware group due to the lack of available data the data collection at year  with dietary questionnaire is currently conducting and we should be available to answer this in a future  in conclusion there is an urgent need of patientcentered nutrition education with precision health approach in response to growing td incidence

Research paper_Journal article,WPKDK_8.docx,Research paper_Journal article,WPKDK_8.docx,this paper presents an investigation on the effect of dam operation on ensemble kalman filter enkf performance in a distributed hydrological model based on kinematic wave theory for this purpose two flood events in a mountainous catchment in japan are selected and the model error parameters for enkf implementation are first determined through a series of experiments by varying the input error magnitude state variable perturbation and its correlation length then through the assimilation of dam outflow observations it is shown that special treatment of such measurements is critical in ensuring the success of the filter when flood control operation significantly changes the flow hydrograph and when covariances between distant grids are high localization based on euclidean distance flow accumulation values and river distance are all able to limit the deleterious updates to model states at distant grids and improve filter efficacy however it is observed that there is no one best localization approach that is consistently the most optimal for varying noise configurations number and type of assimilated stations or flood events furthermore separate localization of dam outflows from the streamflow measurements by assuming the dam grids to be only related to their downstream grids shows some potential in improving prediction at locations near the dams themselves while minimizing disruptions at long distances keywords distributed hydrological model ensemble kalman filter data assimilation localization dam outflow measurements human controlaccurate prediction of floods is critical in saving lives and supporting sustainable development while considerable advances have been made in flood forecasting prediction capabilities are still lacking owing to the uncertainties originating from the simulation models observations and forcing data among others noh et al  data assimilation da techniques which provide the framework to merge the model and observations conditioned on their respective uncertainties pathiraja et al  are used extensively in hydrology to address this issue the state update achieved through da has been shown to be effective in improving model performance eg chen et al  clark et al  komma et al  mcmillan et al  noh et al  reichle et al  revel et al  trudel et al  weerts and el serafy  and others as an extension studies have also shown the usefulness of da in updating the model parameters eg liu et al  moradkhani et al  noh et al  samuel et al  vrugt et al  xie and zhang   and othersda methods can be typically classified as a objective analysis methods and b time dependent methods sun et al  while objective analysis methods such as the variational assimilation algorithms aim to minimize the error between the observation field and the background field usually a temporal snapshot by fusing the new observations into the background time dependent methods such as the ensemble kalman filter use a probabilistic framework and estimate the system state sequentially by propagating information forward in time sun et al  essentially the variational methods update the first guess model by propagating information backwards in time and the sequential methods update the model states when the observations become available liu and gupta kalman filter kalman  is the optimal sequential data assimilation technique for linear model and gaussian errors however to cater to the nonlinear processes of the nature variations of the kalman filter such as the extended kalman filter ekf and the ensemble kalman filter enkf have been developed evensen  ekf involves constructing local linear approximations of the nonlinear operators at each da step to make the filtering problem amenable to the typical kf liu and gupta  but may lead to instabilities and divergence due to the approximations arising from neglecting the higherorder derivatives evensen  enkf addresses this problem by working on the monte carlo generation of the model states and approximating the required statistics from these ensembles enkf is quite popular in the field of earth sciences because of its simplicity ease of implementation and fairly affordable computational requirement evensen  as such the enkf and its variants have been the topic of extensive study in the field of hydrology as well eg clark et al  khaniya et al  maxwell et al  moradkhani et al  paiva et al  rakovec et al  wongchuig et al  and othersin distributed hydrological modeling streamflow measurements and soil moisture data both insitu and remotely sensed are commonly used for assimilation with the enkf of the two discharge observations are more readily available and therefore offer more advantages in rainfallrunoff improvement because of their reliability and direct relation to streamflow modeling liu et al  clark et al  used streamflow observations to successfully update distributed hydrological model states with a variant of the enkf which avoids perturbing the observations through the use of both synthetic and real data rakovec et al  analyzed the effects of the updating frequency and observation density on enkf performance and found that increasing the number of assimilated observations led to more improvement in forecasts compared to increasing the updating frequency noh et al  used streamflow measurements in a real world case to update the model states in a lagtime window framework to account for the routing time lag issue liu et al  also used both the synthetic and real data experiments to show the benefits of assimilating streamflow observations into a distributed hydrological model with the enkf in addition to the streamflow observations outflow measurements from dams and reservoirs in basins with human interventions are as common however impact of including such observations in the assimilation framework on prediction performance remains mostly unexploredclark et al  reported the issue of large updates to state variables at distant locations with streamflow observation assimilation localization is a commonly used method for reducing the spurious correlations that arise in enkf when the ensemble of model states cannot properly describe the correlations rasmussen et al  it can also be used to remove connections between physically distant locations wongchuig et al  localization techniques used in hydrological data assimilation include both distance based and adaptive approaches rasmussen et al  compared these two approaches in an integrated hydrological modeling framework with the ensemble transform kalman filter etkf and found the latter to yield superior results wongchuig et al  used a noneuclidean distance based localization approach with a semidistributed hydrological model revel et al  also used the localized etkf to demonstrate the benefits of using physicallybased localization parameters the localization patches in this case were derived from a semivariogram analysis of longterm historical data and performed better than the traditional euclidean based localization recently el gharamti et al  also reported improved performance from using a topologically based localization that propagates information along the stream compared to the euclidean approach despite these efforts identifying efficient localization approaches for distributed hydrological modeling still remains an important research topic this study investigates the impact of assimilating dam outflow observations with the enkf in a distributed hydrological model setup since these observations are not representative of the natural flow in the catchment but rather the measures of human control different distance based localization approaches are compared for their efficacy in improving flood prediction the localization weights are calculated based on euclidean flow accumulation and river grid distance general applicability of the localization approaches is also tested by excluding dam outflow measurements from the assimilation setup furthermore localization specific to dam outflow measurements where the dam information only affects the grids located downstream is also included this study is therefore conducted with the intention of i evaluating the effect of assimilating a measure of human control ie dam outflow observations on enkf performance ii comparing the efficacy of four distance based localization approaches for different noise settings number of assimilated stations and flood events and iii assess the suitability of a localization method tailored for dam outflow assimilation the experiments are carried out with realworld data only for the purpose of shortterm streamflow modeling and are applied to a fast responding smallscale catchment in japanthe remainder of this paper is organized as follows section  introduces the study area and data used in this study along with the hydrological model the ensemble kalman filter and the corresponding noise models this section also details the localization approaches and the experimental setups for the tests carried out in the study the results of the experiments are summarized and discussed in the following section with the conclusions provided in section a hydrological prediction system with a physicallybased distributed model and the ensemble kalman filter is applied to the kizu river basin a mountainous catchment located in central japan fig  draining approximately  km of the larger yodo river basin the catchment merges with the katsura river basin at the southwestern edge of kyoto and osaka to discharge into the osaka bay the basin receives annual precipitation of around  mm on average and has high flows during the typhoon season from september to october there are five multipurpose dams and one retarding basin within the catchment of the eight observation stations and five dams utilized in the study one observation and four dams are in the nabari river and its tributaries approx  contribution to the total drainage area one dam is in the nunome river around  contribution while the rest are in the kizu river itself and its upstream tributaries topography information required for distributed modeling are based on the second digital elevation model and flow direction data available from hydrological data and maps based on shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales hydrosheds lehner et al  the filter is applied to two flood events in the basin  typhoon from september  and  heavy rainfall from july  gridded precipitation data also called the radarrain gauge analyzed precipitation product are obtained for both these events from the japan meteorological agency jma this product is prepared through the calibration of onehour accumulated radar echo data with the rain gauge precipitation data accumulated over the same duration and provides precipitation estimation in areas lacking rain gauges nagata  precipitation information is available for every minute interval at the resolution of  gauged streamflow observations along with the measurements related to dam operation are obtained from the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism mlit japan streamflow observations for the high flow period between  h and  h were found to be missing at kamo and inooka discharge data at these locations are therefore generated by making use of the existing rating curve equations to extrapolate the recorded stage levels for the  flood one of the upstream gauges has missing observations for most of the flood duration and is therefore only assimilated when data is availablethe distributed hydrological model used in the study kdhm tachikawa and tanaka  was developed at hydrology and water resources research laboratory of kyoto university and is based on kinematic wave theory schematic diagram of the modeling process within the hydrological model is shown in fig  fig  a shows the flow direction data governing the flow movement within the catchment and is generated using the steepest descent algorithm applied to a digital elevation model dem the arrows in the figure therefore indicate the direction of flow movement which is always restricted to a single direction fig  b and c show how each grid within the catchment is modeled this openbook type catchment representation consists of two rectangular slopes on the sides with a stream in the middle precipitation is the input to the slope components and is unrelated to other grids in the catchment the river which receives the outflow from the slopes routes this inflow along with the inflow from possibly more than one upstream grids to its one and only downstream grid there are altogether  grids of approximately  m x  m area upstream of the catchment outlet at inooka for the typical case of shortterm flooding in the study area the model does not account for other hydrological components such as evapotranspiration and groundwater as such the model can be considered as an extension of kinematic wave theory to also include subsurface flows in the slope components ie an integrated kinematic wave model for subsurface flow and overland flows this approach is commonly used in japanese catchments for shortterm streamflow modelingwithin the model slope flow is calculated based on a predefined storagedischarge relationship developed by tachikawa et al  for a soil layer assumed to consist of large voids for gravity water and a matrix layer for capillary water flow the equations used for computing the sloperunoff are given aswhere h q and r are the water depth slope discharge per unit width and rainfall intensity respectively furthermore vc is the saturated flow velocity dc the saturation volumetric moisture content of the matrix layer and  is the exponent parameter describing the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and saturation similarly a is the flow velocity in the large voids in the soil subsurface and  and m are the overland flow parameters the three relations in eq  thus represent unsaturated flow in the matrix layer saturated subsurface flow and overland flow respectively river flow is routed downstream using the kinematic wave approximation of the shallow water equationswhere a is the crosssectional area of the river q the discharge and q is the lateral inflow from slopes these equations are solved using the four point finite difference approximation schemeat those locations where dams or reservoirs are present the openbook type catchment model is replaced by the corresponding dam operation rule or a linear reservoir model where  is the inflow to the dam  the current storage  the predetermined flood discharge and  is the storage capacity of the dam this constant volume discharge scheme is followed by three of the five dams in the basin syorenji murou and hinachi while the remaining two takayama and nunome adopt the constant rate and constant discharge method nakamura and shimatani   for simplicity it is assumed that the operation in the latter two dams is not too dissimilar to the constantvolume discharge scheme the flood control operation rules used here are obtained from mlit and were prepared for the corresponding design floods the actual operation however can vary depending on the flood situationseveritykdhm model parameters for the study are taken from kobayashi et al  as such only a short summary of the calibration procedure is provided here the model was calibrated using the sceua algorithm duan et al  at murou dam for the  typhoon this location was chosen so as to avoid any interference from dam operation rainfall data used for calibration was the gauged precipitation data from mlit and was interpolated using the nearest neighbor interpolation method the nashsutcliffe efficiency nse at the calibration point was obtained as  these parameters were then validated at hirakata station in the yodo river basin catchment area  km for the typhoon lan in  the corresponding nse was obtained as  this study uses the same set of spatially uniform model parameters for both the events without any further tuning ensemble kalman filter evensen  is the monte carlo approximation of the linear kalman filter wherein the probability distribution of the model states is represented using the ensembles generated through the perturbation of one or multiple of model forcing parameters or the states themselves and is corrected based on the measurement uncertaintieswhere  and  are the model states at time  and  respectively with the superscripts  and  denoting the background and analysis form  is the forcing data at time   the model parameter set  is the system noise at time  and  is the hydrological model furthermore  is the observation vector at time   is the linear operator mapping the states into observation space and  is the observation noisethe state vector consists of outflows from the river section in the openbook type model discussed in section  ie in eq  with dams or reservoirs this  is replaced by the outflow calculated using the respective models the total number of state variables is therefore  one for each grid within the basin since streamflow observations are used to update the discharge states directly there is a one to one relationship between the model states and observations the matrix  is hence populated with only ones and zeros   where observations are available and  where they are not  ideally one would also like to include the discharges at the discretized river sections within each grid in the state vector however to reduce the number of state variables discharges at those sections are interpolated by using the grids own updated outflow and the updates in the upstream grids therefore if the innovation at the outlet of a grid  is  for the background discharge  then the innovation along the river in this grid is linearly interpolated within the interval  wherehere  is the innovation at the outlet of the grid  which flows into the grid  and  is the number of upstream gridsin this study noise in the system is represented by perturbing the forcing ie precipitation and the state variables ie discharge uncertainty in the model parameters have not been considered separately precipitation input is perturbed using a lognormal distribution following nijssen and lettenmaier where  is the corrupted hourly precipitation for the uncorrupted precipitation   is a spatially correlated standard normal variable   is the relative error and  is the relative biaswhere  is the fractional error term for the state  here the errors  are considered to have been drawn from a gaussian distribution of mean  and standard deviation equivalent to the magnitude of the state scaled by the fractional error the spatial correlation of both the precipitation and state variable noise is modelled as an exponential decay function given bywhere  is the grid distance between the grids  and  in euclidean space and  is the correlation length in number of grid cells pixels temporal correlations of the errors are not considered for either noise models while it is well known that the success of data assimilation experiments is dependent on the errors in the model and the observations accurate information about these errors is generally not available or the errors themselves are difficult to identify chen et al  thiboult et al  as a replacement of such knowledge sensitivity tests are often carried out to estimate these error parameters eg chen et al  paiva et al  this study also adopts this methodology and hence the model error parameters namely the precipitation relative error state variable fractional error  and its correlation length are tuned through the sensitivity experiments detailed in section  correlation lengths of the precipitation errors are estimated from the semivariograms constructed using the gridded data for the study region and the relative bias  is assumed to be zero for simplicitythe observation error  is defined in a similar manner to the noise in the state variables  drawn from a normal distribution of mean  and scaled standard deviation  and is given aswhere  is the fractional error term for the observation  observation noise spatial correlation has not been considered this approach of noise modeling is common in hydrological data assimilation eg clark et al  paiva et al  rakovec et al  and others as it assigns larger uncertainties to the high flows to account for the uncertainties in discharge rating curves introduced by limited gauging of streamflows in this period clark et al  the observation error scaling  is taken as  based on previous studies involving streamflow assimilation eg clark et al the issue of spurious correlations typically occurs with limited size ensembles and applying appropriate localization techniques can help improve model performance while keeping the computational burden at a minimum localization can also be used to remove connections between areas that are not physically related by modifying the background error covariance matrix since dam outflows are the results of human intervention that affect mostly the areas located near these structures localization might be a crucial component of the filter in ensuring its successwhere  is the  element in the  row of the matrix   is the distance between the grids  and  and  is the correlation length then the kalman gain given by eq  is computed using the background error matrix  modified aswhere the  on the right hand side is the same as computed using eq   denotes the elementwise schur product and  is the assignment operator all the localization approaches used in the study use a stationary localization matrix  which are prepared only once at the beginning of the simulation periodthe distance  between any two grids  and  is defined in four different ways also see fig  i euclidean distance where the distance is calculated following euclidean geometry referred as euc ii flow accumulation distance where the distance is calculated as the difference in flow accumulation values between these grids referred as acc iii similar to ii but the grids in different tributaries are considered to be unrelated referred as accst and iv  river distance where the distance is calculated by counting the number of grids along the river network in the same tributary that separate the two grids referred as riv since riv localization is akin to measuring the chainage distance along the river network grids with large difference in flows but located close to each other eg grids upstream and downstream of confluence points will be considered to be closer compared to the acc or accst approaches where distance is calculated based on accumulation number also see fig c and d furthermore for accst and riv approaches the distances between the grids in different tributaries are not defined and as such the corresponding entries in the covariance matrix are changed to zero the riv localization is similar to the one proposed by el gharamti et al  which localizes the covariance matrix along the river streamone more localization approach only applicable to dam outflow assimilation is also tested in the study this approach applies localization based on flow accumulation values only to the downstream of the dams while assuming the dams to be unrelated to the grids located upstream furthermore the dam grids do not receive updates from any of the other assimilated observations this implies that the relationship between the dam grids and the downstream grids is asymmetric and is also reflected as such in the covariance matrix the asymmetry of the localized covariance matrix  is not problematic as it is never explicitly used in the ensemble kalman filter equations however asymmetry of the matrix  may render the matrix  noninvertible this can be precluded by forcing the matrix  to be symmetric by changing all the entries corresponding to the crosscovariances with the dam grids to zero this means that even the observations downstream of the dams are considered to be unrelated to the dam outflow observations for the purpose of calculating the gain matrix correlation structure for dam localization for the localization length of  is shown in fig  experiments related to the localized implementation are described in section three sets of experiments are included in this study i experiments with different system noise models for enkf parameter tuning ii assimilation of dam outflow measurements and iii localization the first set of experiments is carried out to determine the best parameters for filter implementation while the second set is meant to investigate the impact of assimilating dam outflow observations on filter performance both these sets are the standard implementation of the enkf without localization the last set of experiments is the localized implementation of the filter and tests whether localization can improve prediction by removing spurious correlations all the experiments are carried out with  ensembles with observations assimilated every hourexperimental setup is shown in table  the observation error scaling  is fixed at  while the model error scaling  see eq  is varied in the range  to  these settings are repeated for different input errors e ranging from  to  correlation lengths for these errors are taken as  and  grid cells for the  and  event respectively based on semivariogram inspection the correlation of state variable perturbations is modelled as given by eq  with correlation lengths  of    and  grid cells  grid is approximately of size  m x  m observation errors are not considered to be correlated these sensitivity experiments are carried out for both the events by assimilating five streamflow gauges and inflows to the five dams within the basin see fig  these are collectively referred as assimilated stations three gauging stations at different locations in the basin ie inooka nabari and shimagahara are not used for assimilation and are left only for evaluation they are collectively referred as validation stations and are consistent across all the experiments carried out in this studyafter selecting the parameters for enkf implementation effect of including dam outflow measurements in the assimilation setup is tested for both the events for two noise settings e         and e         see section  for discussion on noise parameter selection the number of assimilated stations is therefore increased to   five additional outflow measurements for each of the five dams in the basinexperimental setup for localization implementation is shown in table  different correlation lengths  are defined for the tested localization approaches and experiments are carried out for the two noise settings e         and e          the results of these experiments are then compared with the ensemble open loop simulation ie no assimilation the ensemble open loop or the enol differs from the deterministic offline simulation in the sense that while the latter is a single model simulation without any correction from the filter the former is a probabilistic run without assimilation to facilitate comparison among different localization approaches simulations are started with the same seed for random number generation which ensures consistency in the input and state variable perturbationsthis set of experiments compares different distance based localization approaches for the two noise settings while varying the number and type of the assimilated stations first assimilation scenario involves assimilating all the available observations which amounts to  stations in total  dam inflow measurements  dam outflow measurements and  streamflow observation stations the second scenario involves assimilating only the streamflow observations and the dam inflow measurements  in total the third scenario involves the assimilation of only the three upstream gauges ie the inflows to the dams syorenji murou and hinachi this experiment set is conducted for only the  flood because of the significant changes induced by dam operation to the flow hydrograph while all  observations are assimilated it is assumed that dam outflows can be treated differently to the streamflow including the dam inflow observations and therefore the entries in the covariance matrix that are related to these  observations are localized using the distance based approach while those that relate to the dam observations are localized only in the downstream direction by cutting off their relationship with the grids upstream section  to this end only the localization length that gives the best performance at the basin outlet when  observations are assimilated is selected and different correlation lengths        for dam outflow localization are tested in other words correlation length for streamflow observation localization is fixed while varying the correlation length for dam outflow observation localizationfor evaluation two metrics namely the root mean square error rmse and the normalized error reduction index ner are used they are given aswhere  and  are the  model forecast and observation respectively for the time series of length  ie the simulation duration rmse ranges from  to  with values close to zero indicating better performance and the ner ranges from  to  with values greater than  indicative of improvement in prediction in relation to the base simulation base simulation in this study corresponds to the deterministic offline simulation without assimilation unless otherwise statedsensitivity of the filter performance to different noise parameters ie rainfall perturbation error e state variable fractional error  and its correlation length  for the  typhoon and  heavy rainfall is shown in fig  note that the correlation lengths of the input errors are fixed at  and  for these two events respectively  is plotted in the horizontal axis while  is in the vertical axis and each column represents different input perturbation e average ner  values for the relevant stations calculated for the ensemble mean time series are indicated in the bins for assimilated stations top rows this is the average of  stations and for validation stations bottom rows this is the average of  stations texts within the bins indicate the number of stations where the ner is positive bins where the texts indicate  for assimilated stations or  for validation stations therefore correspond to those cases where all the evaluated stations have positive ner   it is clear that the filter performance tends to improve as the input error e increases with the best results seen for the highest e   for both assimilated and validation stations this could be because other uncertainties in hydrological modeling are not considered explicitly in the study except for state perturbation and hence the larger input uncertainty compensates for this limitation this is also discussed by thiboult et al  who note that the enkf error parameters tend to be unintuitive when other error components are not disentangled so it should be noted that such a large error in the input data while best for assimilation purposes may not be representative of the actual errors in the precipitation productfor assimilated stations the performance is less sensitive to the state variable perturbation and its correlation length compared to the validation stations filter updates at these assimilated locations are mostly controlled by the observations available at the same grids where the performances are also evaluated however for validation stations observations are unavailable at those points and therefore the updates are controlled by their covariances with observation grids as such performances at the validation locations degrade for higher   and smaller  due likely to the larger and inconsistent gains which are related to the magnitude and the sign of the kalman gain as the sign of the gain can vary even in close locations with weak correlations increasing  avoids sharp variations in filter updates especially with larger  leading to not only improved prediction but also less oscillatory hydrographs for both the events while higher values of provide the best performance at the assimilated stations ner at the validation stations are usually less than  in these cases meaning that the performance is worse than the deterministic simulation therefore two noise settings e         and e         are chosen for the remainder of the study as they give satisfactory results at all the assimilated and most of the validation stations fig  shows the effect of assimilating the dam outflow measurements at the three validation stations in the rows for the two noise settings in the columns for the  event the number in the top right corner of each panel shows ner  where the base rmse is taken for the case without dam outflow assimilation with which the case with dam outflow assimilation is evaluated positive ner therefore indicates improvement due to dam outflow assimilation compared to when dam outflows are not assimilated and negative ner indicates otherwise fig  shows the same for the  flood impact of dam assimilation at all the locations in the basin can be observed in fig assimilation of dam outflow measurements generally has a positive impact at the location close to the dam ie nabari also see fig  but tends to degrade performance at distant locations eg inooka the basin outlet the degradation of performance near the outlet is magnified when correlated errors with larger magnitude of state variable perturbations are used eg noise configuration e         for the  flood furthermore the deleterious updates are also related to the dam operation in real time or in other words when abrupt changes in flows are caused by either sudden storage or release of flows from the dams filter performance tends to be affected this is the reason why the performance is more degraded for the  flood compared to the  eventfor the  flood noise configuration e         results at inooka are particularly worse between september  and  when the flows are severely underestimated which coincides with sudden changes in flow due to flood control operation in the upstream dams limited flow release from the dams around this period can be seen in fig  where the deterministic offline solid line and observed dashed line hydrographs for the five dams in the basin are plotted when spurious correlations exist such operations can have deleterious impact on the grids where the effects of dam operation may not appear until later the tendency for the flow to be affected by the filter in this period is more pronounced in this noise setting compared to the one with smaller  and  as the former configuration leads to larger covariance between grids resulting in higher gains and as such any negative influence is also magnifiedwhile this tendency of the filter to be affected at long distances is related to the issue of time lag encountered in hydrological data assimilation the case of dam outflow assimilation is peculiar in the sense that this is mostly affected by the decision making of the dam operator rather than the laws of hydrology while this added uncertainty introduced by dam operation may be undesirable for assimilation purposes quick appraisal of the situation during a flood event is actually critical in limiting the damages through efficient dam operation and as such sudden changes in flows near the dams are expected  especially during a large event such as the one seen in  but as seen from the results this can have deleterious impact at distant locations and therefore some localization approaches to contain these spurious correlations between the model states and the dam measurements are explored next table  summarizes the best localization methods and lengthslevels for the three validation stations for different number or type of assimilated stations and noise settings for the  event table  shows the same for the  flood for the case where the dam outflow assimilation has the most impact ie noise configuration e         for the  flood the deleterious updates at the basin outlet have been removed through localization all four localization approaches significantly improve upon the case with no localization with the most improvement seen for accst localization as the issue of flows erroneously updating to zero is eradicated see fig  the flood peaks are also better estimated as the spurious correlations in this region are mostly tempered through localization localization improves performance at the other two locations as well with the error reduction of as much as  and  compared to assimilation without localization seen at nabari and shimagahara respectively for euc localization however accst localization slightly increases the rms errors at these two locationsthe impact of localization on prior covariance can be seen in fig  which shows the representative plots of the error covariances between the catchment grids and the hinachi dam outflow ie an individual column of the matrix  for different localization approaches and correlation lengths when no localization is applied fig a covariances between the dam and the downstream grids are quite high but with localization fig b these covariances are reduced although at different rates with different localization lengths meaning that the deleterious updates from dam outflows are tempered at the downstream grids for euc and acc localization approaches as the correlation length increases the localization factors ie the elements of the matrix  tend to approach unity which limits the changes to the covariance matrix as such using very high correlation lengths for these two approaches causes the results to be the same as those without localization however for the other two approaches accst and riv the covariance matrix after localization does not approach the one prior to localization even when the correlation length is increased as the covariances between the grids in the different tributaries are always set to zero regardless of the correlation lengthmore generally localization has a positive impact on assimilation performance in all the tested cases as the rms errors after localization are reduced compared to assimilation without localization in some scenarios however while localization reduces the errors caused by spurious correlations it is unable to improve upon the ensemble open loop simulation eg at inooka for the  flood and at shimagahara for  flood when only the upstream gauges are assimilated for these cases the tested localization methods at best are only able to remove the updates altogether but not extract the information from other stations that would improve the filter efficacy therefore the best performances for these cases tend to approach the open loop scenario it should also be noted that for a few of these approaches some localization lengths produced significantly worse results but have been omitted from the tables as the optimal correlation lengths for localization are usually determined via a sensitivity analysis and therefore only those that performed the best for the given localization approaches are included herefurthermore there is no one superior localization approach or the localization length that is suitable for all noise settings assimilated stations validation locations or events in general better results after localization are obtained with the noise setting with larger and strongly correlated perturbations to the state variables compared to the weakly correlated smaller noise setting this could be due to localization causing the covariances to be too weak when the prior covariances are already small to begin with meaning that the updates corresponding to the true correlations are then also removed one of the exceptions to this is seen at shimagahara for the  flood for  stations assimilated where the best results after assimilation are the same as the ensemble open loop performance for which the weakly correlated noise with smaller state variable perturbation has a lower rmse the best results therefore correspond to the cases where the covariances between grids in different tributaries are set to zero ie accst and riv or approach zero due to very small localization length euc with low localization level as all the observations assimilated stations are located in a different tributary this hints at issues with information transfer to ungauged basins however the same is not observed for the  flood for this event even for only  stations assimilated euc and acc localization are able to improve upon both the open loop simulation and assimilation without localization here the rms errors are again smaller for the larger state variable perturbation the discussions that follow therefore focus only on the noise configuration e        the best localization approach is also not necessarily the same for different number of assimilated stations for example for the  flood best localization approaches for improving performance at inooka are accst with medium localization level when all  observations are assimilated riv with medium localization level for  stations assimilated and accst with medium localization level for  stations assimilated  for the  flood these correspond to riv with low localization level for  stations assimilated and euc with low localization level for the latter two similarly the most suitable localization level ie correlation length can also vary depending on the location eg for the  flood when  stations are assimilated the best localization levels for accst are high medium low and medium at inooka nabari and shimagahara respectively while this can be ameliorated to an extent through extensive sensitivity analysis it may be beneficial to use different localization lengths for different observation stations nevertheless even if such an approach of spatially heterogeneous localization length is adopted any localization parameter obtained through sensitivity experiments might cause issues during operational forecasting in real time as sudden malfunction of observation gauges can lead to missing information and previously determined localization lengths may no longer be optimal as a result adaptive localization approaches which obviate the need for conducting sensitivity experiments should be developed so as to facilitate the integration of these filtering algorithms into real time forecasting systems it is also noted that the performance of the euclidean approach euc is comparable to other approaches that are based on river network structure ie acc accst or riv for the tested localization lengths for example as can be seen from tables  and  euc localization outperforms the other approaches including no localization in  out of  total cases of these thirteen cases however twelve are for the two gauging stations with smaller upstream areas seven at shimagahara and five at nabari while only one is for the outlet station ie inooka where either the accst or riv localization is superior this is possibly because for catchments with small contributing areas where the basin response time is short precipitation which is governed by the euclidean distance plays a very important role and as such even the traditional euclidean approach performs quite well nevertheless since any localization implementation is bound to be case specific different patterns may be revealed depending on the application region andor methodology eg el gharamti et al  revel et al returning to the  flood for the noise configuration e         it is seen that rmse after localization at inooka for  stations assimilated is smaller than the rmse after localization for  stations assimilated see table  as the five extra stations are all related to dam outflows this indicates that treating the dam outflow measurements the same as the streamflow measurements in this case to find the best localization approachlength has also denied the areas near the outlet of the correct filter updates on the other hand opposite behavior is observed at nabari which is located near the three upstream dams as the rmse after localization for  stations assimilated is smaller at this location compared to  stations assimilated so if we assume that the localization implementation is constrained by having to choose a single optimal parameter  ie the correlation length for the whole basin then some compromise has to be found in order to balance the filter performance at these two locations this assumption is not too unrealistic as using a single localization parameter at the basin scale for localization is common in hydrological data assimilation eg el gharamti et al  khaki et al  wongchuig et al  one approach of reaching the said compromise could be to select the best correlation length for the catchment outlet for localization with  assimilated stations and use a different way of localization specific to dams to update the state variables in their vicinity as such medium localization level for euc acc and riv localization and high localization level for accst localization are selected and the dam outflow measurements are localized separately the expectation with this method is that the performance at inooka should be similar to the best result at inooka achieved with the localization length that is optimized for inooka for the case with  assimilated stations and the performance at nabari should approach that achieved with the localization length optimized for nabari itself for the case with  assimilated stations fig  shows the results for  stations assimilated where the  streamflow gauges are localized using the distancebased method and the  dam outflow measurements are localized using the dam localization approach different shapes of points represent the correlation lengths for dam outflow localization red dotted lines indicate the rmse for  stations assimilated case for the localization length optimized for inooka and the blue dotted lines indicate the rmse for the localization length optimized for nabari when all  stations are assimilatedfor all localization approaches the rmses at nabari have decreased compared to localization with only  stations assimilated except for very high dam localization lengths eg  for accst and riv increasing the dam localization length also affects performance at the basin outlet in general smaller dam localization lengths tend to improve performance at nabari while keeping the rmses at inooka mostly unchanged for such small lengths the filter performance at shimagahara is also similar to the performance obtained from the localization of only the  streamflow observation stations esp accst and riv however for the tested lengths none of the results at nabari match the blue line ie the rms error obtained for the length optimized for nabari when all  stations are assimilated this is due likely to the fact that dam localization ie localization only in the downstream direction is applied for the whole duration of the flood rather than for just the dam operation period nevertheless these results indicate that the dam localization approach used here has the potential to be used for improving filter performance at the immediate downstream of the dams without affecting performances at very distant locationsthis study investigated the effect of assimilating dam outflow measurements on ensemble kalman filter performance in a distributed hydrological model applied to a smallscale catchment experiments with different system noise models parameterized by precipitation relative error model state fractional errorscaling and state error correlation lengths were first carried out to determine the best enkf parameters the efficacy of data assimilation increased with increasing magnitude of precipitation error while the magnitude and the correlation of the state variable perturbations were important in improving assimilation at grids where observations were not available at these locations filter performance improved and the sensitivity to the state error fractional term was also reduced with increasing state error correlation length as the issue of inconsistent spatial noise structure over the basin was resolved assimilating dam outflow observations led to deleterious updates to the state variables more so when dam operation caused significant changes to the flow and when the state variable perturbations were larger and strongly correlated all four distance based approaches tested in this study were able to limit the impact of these measurements at long hydrological distances as the predictions significantly improved near the basin outlet the issue of deleterious updates was also tempered within the basin however experiments conducted by varying the noise setting number and type of assimilated stations flood events indicated that there is no one localization approach or the corresponding correlation length that is best for all locations within the basin any localization implementation therefore would benefit from carrying out sensitivity tests beforehand to determine the most suitable localization method the results further highlighted the need for developing more sophisticated localization techniques that can adapt themselves to yield the most optimal filter performanceindependent localization of dam outflow measurements from the streamflow observations was also tested in the study to this end streamflow observations were localized using the traditional distance based approaches and the dam outflow observations were assumed to affect only the grids located downstream as such covariances between the dam grids and their upstream grids were set to zero while an exponential decay function was used to calculate the localization weight for the downstream grids the distance for calculating this weight was based on the flow accumulation values of the grids such separate treatment of dam outflows showed some potential in improving prediction at locations near the dams themselves using this approach during the period of dam operation therefore can limit the deleterious updates to the state variables at distant locations and help avoid filter degradation future studies are expected to utilize these insights to develop more robust localization approaches which ensure that the filter updates are consistent with the hydrology of the catchmentthis research was supported by council for science technology and

polymers thermal propertiesc  department of materials and applied chemistry college of science and technology nihon university keywords molecular morphology polymer concept molecular modeling entanglement amorphous polymer monodisperse polymer thermal property glass transition temperatureabstract this study clarifies the influence of polymer entanglement on the physicochemical properties of polymers flexible polymer molecule chains exist as randomly coiled networks that freely entangle with each other however the structure of the entangled polymer remains unknown we reexamined the effects of molecular weight m on the glass transition temperature tg of monodisperse polymethyl methacrylate pmma and polystyrene ps polymer entanglement began near the entanglement molecular weight me increased tg and affected the thermal characteristics the entanglementformation region corresponds to the characteristic molecular weight mc in pmma but reached  mc in ps a new molecular model is proposed for the volumes in the numerator and denominator of the free volume fraction fg where fg   of tg furthermore this molecular model supports the importance of the free rotation of several segments formed by a dozen monomer units from the end of the chain that is microbrownian motion by the crankshaft these results also strongly suggest that the appearance of tg is not due to a decrease in free volume void but to the barrier energy of the temperaturedependent rotational motion of cc bonds this proposed model redefines the historically established polymer concept as a molecular theorythe seminal publication by h staudinger in  revealed the limitations of the prevailing thought and concepts in understanding macromolecules  the subsequent evolution of theoretical concepts experimental advances and controversies improved the understanding of macromolecules which were indispensable to human society in the th century the random coil theory by flory proposed that flexible and semiflexible polymer chains from solids to liquids melts have entangled structures that freely penetrate each other the existence of molecular chains in an unperturbed gaussian distribution in the  state has been clarified from smallangle neutron scattering data however the nature of the entangled structure formed and its effect on the physical properties remain unknown the mean square radius of gyration s which is an index of the size of an unperturbed singlemolecule random coil chain in the  state is proportional to the molecular weight m  and the volume v of the random coil can be expressed by the following equationthe mass of one molecule is mna and the density  g  cm is mnav where na is avogadros number considering polymethyl methacrylate pmma as an example where m     gmol the wormlike chain kratkyporod kp model predicts a  value of approximately  gcm for a v value of    cm which is inconsistent with the observed  value of approximately  gcm this inconsistency arises because the molecular chain itself has a high  value but also has many voids in its spherical coil form the observed  value depends on the temperature and m but if    gcm at  c approximately  pmma chains interpenetrate into the random coil of one molecule the nature and type of such structural entanglement formed by approximately  identical molecules gathering into a random coil sphere remain unknown in this field and are discussed in detail in subsequent sectionsdeformations of solid polymers at the molecular level are classified as elastic or plastic deformations elastic deformations follow hookes law where the materials return to their original state upon the removal of the external force whereas materials undergoing plastic deformations do not return to their original state when the external force is removed elastic deformations are further divided into energy and entropy elasticities the deformations occurring in the melt flow region are classified as plastic deformations in the elastically deformed region the elastic modulus of the highmolecular weight polymer forming the entanglement is  pa below the glass transition temperature tg but starts to decrease gradually and reaches  pa in the rubberlike plateau region when the temperature exceeds tg even though the change in the polymer  value during this period is approximately  the basis for this significant change on the order of approximately  has not been clarified yet these aspects are the focus of the second report of this research series to unravel the mystery behind the unique behavior of macromolecules we conducted further research on the effect of polymer entanglement on the physicochemical properties of amorphous polymersit is well known that the physical properties of polymers are proportional to the number of molecular chain ends which decreases with increasing molecular weight m ie m for example assuming that tg ie the tg of a completely networked m having no termini is obtained when the entanglement equilibrium is reached on increasing m m decreases infinitely however the number of chain ends are not zero and are always present as two units tg is the temperature at which all end group and segment movements are frozen the inability to depict the molecular morphology of the entanglements seems to be the reason for these historical developments it should be reaffirmed that the  values of the physical properties are not constant and approach infinity we believe that it is essential to analyze the essence of polymers and reconfirm the idea that the understanding of the various physical properties is too biased toward the consideration of the two ends of the chain therefore the essential physical parameters of polymeric materials such as specific volume vp  reciprocal vp thermal volume expansion coefficient  tg refractive index viscosity and elastic modulus g reach a certain equilibrium value as the molecular weight increases that is the infinite molecular weight m polymer with no termini has been discussed as a function of p the relationship between these physical parameters and the molecular weight is well known and the equilibrium value appears at a certain molecular weight as the molecular weight increases most of the macromolecular physical properties have been interpreted to arise from polymer entanglement formations however the specific effects caused by the entanglements are only partially understood in other words it is not yet possible to correlate the influence of entanglement on the overall molecular morphologythe purpose of this work is to analyze the microbrownian motions that have very short relaxation times compared to the macrobrownian motions of the center of gravity of the entire polymer such as reptation in a tube  this work also reexamines the classical data according to the empirical formula and proposes a basic structural unit that is the origin of the density and modulus of the macromolecule as a result the inadequacies of the classical concepts proposed based on the terminal group movements alone are revised our studies did not involve complicated statistical methods or simulations the thermal mechanical and viscosity characteristics revealed that partial microbrownian motions such as the crankshaft rotation of many polymer segments the density inverse of specific volume and elasticity of polymers and the viscosity of flexible polymer chains with gaussian distribution can be interpreted using a simple d molecular chain model with the parameters of the kp wormlike chain model  for entanglement formation overall we clarified the effect of entanglement formation on the molecular weight dependence of tg in semiflexible monodisperse polymersmolecular weight dependence of tg figure  shows a plot of the tg values of the commercial monodisperse pmma  and ps samples as functions of logarithmic molecular weight together with the lines of the most probable me  and mc   values reported previously an unperturbed state of the polymer chain was realized for flexible polymers in the molten state it has been experimentally and theoretically confirmed that the dependence of the zeroshear viscosity of molten polymers on m is generally computed by m  for mmc and m  for mmc and that of the selfdiffusion coefficient is given by m  mmc and m  mmc where mc is the characteristic molecular weight  the value of mc is estimated to be approximately three times larger than that of me which is the m value of the onset of the entanglement determined from the plateau modulus rtme of linear viscoelasticity  where  is the density at t since then the relationship between dynamic properties such as the selfdiffusion coefficient  and an elastic modulus  of the nonentangled and entangled systems has been actively interpreted using the rouse and reptation modelsas shown in figure a for the monodisperse pmma tg was maintained at a constant value of approximately  c above mc but decreased sharply with a decrease in m below mc ute et al  prepared uniform pmma samples without molecular weight distribution from the mer m   gmol to the mer m   gmol by the repeated fractionation of the anionic pmma sample using supercritical fluid chromatography the resulting uniform pmma sample was amorphous and was analyzed according to the wellknown and widely used empirical formula    where tg is a characteristic of the polymer and tg expresses the physical characteristics of the polymers the tg value at which m is m where all molecular chains are bonded to form a threedimensional network is tg the difference in tg of these macromolecules is thought to be due to the change in the number of chain ends considering that a polymer with m has no end the free volume vf increases when m decreases from m is equal to the volume increase due to the increase in the number of chain ends ute et al reported that the reciprocal molecular weight dependence of tg follows the formula tg c          m the observed values and the values calculated using this equation for m   gmol to  gmol are plotted in figure a it is evident from the figure that  c was obtained at m   gmol with tg   c in the equation the measured tg value of the sample with m   is almost the same as the value calculated using this formula but those of the samples with greater m values are higher than the corresponding calculated values then when the m value was  or more the tg value approached a constant value of   c within the error range this could imply that a new tg value appeared notably the significant increase in tg values begins near the molecular weight me value between entanglement pointsthe molecular weight dependence of the tg value using the amorphous monodisperse ps sample generated using the report by aras et al  is shown in figure b the polymers were nbutyl terminated anionic pss supplied by polymer laboratory ltd with molecular weights ranging from  gmol to    gmol and mwmn   the molecular weight in the figure is the same as the mn value used by aras et al the tg value increases sharply with increasing mn at first glance this is similar to that for pmma and tg   c is obtained from around m     gmol via the me and mc valuesreciprocal molecular weight dependence of tg figure a shows a plot of tg against m in pmma and figure b shows the plot of tg in ps however in both cases the samples were in the liquid state at room temperature with m   gmol or less for pmma and ps the tg values are smaller than the slope corresponding to the solidstate sample in the low molecular weight region and are not shown for pmma the correlation coefficient r with m   gmol or less is  and the slope k agrees with that of  described by ute et al however surprisingly the slope k   r   at m   gmol was more than twice that at m   gmol or less the k value for ps was  r   when m   gmol or less and was  r   when m was above  gmol it is noteworthy that for both pmma and ps the k value reached an inflection point near the me value in addition the m values as calculated from the intersection of these two correlation lines were  and  gmol for pmma and ps respectively these values for pmma and ps are in the vicinity of the me value similarly the m values when obtained from the intersection of the correlation line in the region above me and a constant tg value were  and  gmol for pmma and ps respectively the corresponding mmc values were  and  respectively in the case of pmma tg becomes constant near the mc value while that of ps becomes constant at  mc for ps in the case of ps entanglement gradually occurs even if mc is exceeded in the case of pmma entanglement may be driven by the dipole interactions between the carbonyl groups of the side chain the molten state as described above is a nonentangled isolated state composed of low molecular chain components that cannot entangle below the molecular weight me between the entanglement crosslinking points then a polymer chain longer than me at which entanglement begins becomes a molten state with a pseudonetwork structure due to entanglement we propose that the entanglement formation region memamc of the molten polymer exists between that of the isolated chain state mme and the state at which the entanglement is sufficient amc m with respect to the increase in molecular weight additionally the coefficient a is approximately  for pmma and about  for ps respectively watanabe reported that the a selfdiffusion coefficient values of ps and hydrogenated polybutadiene are mc and mc respectively in the molten statefree volume and thermal volume expansion coefficient at tg bueche et al  assumed that the end groups appeared by bond dissociation from m which has no end and the dimensionless volume ve cmcm of the termini per unit volume cm of the polymer was established in terms of fk is obtained from as naf of the tg vs m plot  where  is the free volume of the two end groups for ps    can be computed by using the  value of polymer and not f and was found to be about    that of polyvinyl chloride is   we recalculated  using the k value in the mme region obtained from the previous section and the  and  value reported by fox et al the results are shown in the upper part of table  as a result the  value was    cm for pmma and    cm for ps furthermore we hypothesized that this free volume is retained in the mem region and calculated the  value in this molecular weight region the  value of pmma was  deg and the  value of ps was   deg the results of these calculations are shown in the lower part of table  the  value of pmma in the mem region decreased to about  in the mme region but it was approximately  in the ps region this indicates that the volume of pmma decreases to a larger extent than that of ps upon entanglement the m value that reaches the tg value mentioned above is approximately  mc for pmma while that for ps remains at  mcfree volumes vfg and fg at tg williams landel and ferry developed the wellknown wlf equation which explains the temperature dependence of melt viscosity  the wlf equation is derived based on the following relationship between the free volume fraction f at a certain temperature t and the free volume fraction fg at tgwhere free volume fraction f  vfv the total volume of the polymer v  vs  vf vs is the volume of the molecular skeleton of the polymer and f is the coefficient of thermal volume expansion of vf in the polymer which has not yet been defined   however although the values of vf and vs are not shown here it is clearly stated that vfvs as a result f  vfvs is derived in other words when the polymer melt is gradually cooled the free volume becomes a fraction of fg   ratio of   vfgvsg and tg appears this empirically equals free volume fraction fg at tg and has been widely used over the years as a characteristic of polymersbefore discussing  we considered the basic form of free volume required by microbrownian motion figure a shows the molecular model used in the calculation and the corresponding calculation results are listed in table  let the segment length of the semiflexible polymer be the persistence length q of the wormlike kp chain for ps the value of q is calculated to be   from the smallangle neutron scattering sans data moreover this value is constant from room temperature to approximately  c however the q value by sans measurement of the pmma chain could not be found directly and it was estimated using the relational expression between the characteristic ratio c and the q value related to the chain dimension of the molecular chain derived by flory c  q  b here b is the distance between the cc bond figure b the c value of molten pmma is reported to be  and if b    then q    therefore   which is widely used was adopted in this calculation this molecular model can express the rotational motion of a segment whose side is q which is a combination of a cone vf and a cylinder vf and the former can also be applied to the rotational motion of the chain end comprising two segments figure c the free volume required by the crankshaft motion performed by the five segments was calculated using the relationship vfc  vf  vf the bond angle  was set to     using a bond angle of zero for the freely jointed chain and a cc bond complementary angle of  for the freely rotating chain kp model the conformation angle    corresponds to one rotation vfg is related to the free volume  at tg as shown in table  and vfgvf and vfgvfc are the ratios of the rotational motion volume of the chain end and crankshaft respectively next we considered the volume vs occupied by the molecular skeleton at the total volume v  vs  vf corresponding to the specific volume of one molecule the value of vs was then calculated using the alltransformation model shown in figure b in other words a cylinder of length l and diameter d of the stretch chain model was employed and l was calculated by l  b cos   mm    atomic force microscopy measurements revealed that the thickness of a single strand of pmma was   when the relative humidity was  and   when the relative humidity was   therefore if a maximum value of   is adopted for d when m     gmol and m   gmol then l     cm and vs     cm are obtained using       l the density s of this molecule is   navs   gcm because the  value of the whole molecule is approximately  gcm at  c  as a random coil v     cm the volume of vs in the coil is approximately    cm and hence the volume fraction is vsv   this calculation result clearly shows that even if  identical molecules are entangled and interpenetrated in a singlestranded random coil chain approximately  voids further this fraction has the same value even with a single chain     na   and therefore if the molecular radius is calculated from the value of the denominator a value of about   molecular diameter   is obtained in other words the difference of   from the molecular radius of   molecular diameter of   is estimated to be the space between the single strands this   space is cited and discussed in the relevant section of the second report of this study series these estimates provide clear evidence that more than half of the sphere is a void despite the interpenetration of  molecular chains into the random coil in this case it is clear that the denominator in the original equation of fg should be vg  vsg  vfg because vsg  vfg instead of vsg vfg for tg adopted in the wlf equationthe fg value should be evaluated as fg  vfgvg in other words this is the basis for using the volume expansion coefficient  of the polymer for the undefined free volume expansion coefficient f used in equations  and  this suggests that the physical meaning of fg   must be reconsidered the equal free volume fraction fg based on the wlf equation is defined by fg  vfgvg however the numerator vfg and denominator vg are unknown the temperature at which all microbrownian motions in the molecule are frozen is tg and fg of   at this time point is empirically widely accepted for both pmma and ps in table  the numerator of vfgvfc is obtained at  as shown in table  and the volume required for one rotation of the crankshaft is obtained as the denominator vfc the vfgvfc values were approximately  for pmma and  for ps both for freely jointed and freely rotating chains which are approximately the same as the fg value however because the value of  calculated using equation  by bueche et al  is a sphere due to the rotation of the end of the chain the radius is   which is interpreted as the radius of gyration for one monomer unit however using vf of the freely rotating chain in table  fg    vfgvf is  for pmma and that for ps is  table  and figures a and c however the relationship between the fg ratio of  or  and  derived by the wlf equation is unclear this is because of the inadequacies of the definitions of equations  to address this equation  can be rewritten based on this definition as followshowever it has already been pointed that the numerator vfg and denominator vg of fgvfgvg are not explained in equation  nonetheless the increase in ve of the free volume in equation  is expressed based on equation  as followsbecause tg is the value at m and the free volume vfg at this time point is defined as zero equation  is given bytherefore it is understood that the free volume  per unit volume of one molecule obtained from the slope k  naf of tg vs m plot corresponds to ve  vfgvfg  fg at tg therefore fg is the value of the true free volume at tg in other words if fg     at tg the new denominator of fg would be ve     see the value of vfc in table  where fg   for pmma and  for ps in this context it is unclear what the numerator   ve means again please note the change in the free volume value required by the rotational motion which depends on the  value data in table  in a freely rotating chain as the angle  decreases the value of vfc decreases and the value of vfgvfc  fg increases the values are approximately  for pmma and approximately  for ps when the vfc value becomes equal to vfg similarly the fg value at tg is given at the point where the vfc value becomes equal to vfg in other words the new denominator vg at fg  vfgvg  is the vfc value when the rotation angle  of the crankshaft motion is  and the new numerator is thus concluded to be   ve  vfcfgin summary according to previous findings on the relationship between tg and microbrownian motions of the main chain and two chain ends consisting of one monomer unit the frozen motions start in ascending order of activation energy as the temperature rises excluding the movement of the side chain the energy of the rotational movement of one terminal segment figure c was compared to the rotational movement of the crankshaft of approximately five segments figure d the magnitude of the former is overwhelmingly lower than that of the latter moreover as shown in table  the free volume required for the former movement is about  times smaller than that required for the latter movement however at  values of  ps and  pmma of the crankshaft which is the same as vfg when the temperature rises the segment motion at the polymer chain end is frozen when the temperature increases further and the movement at the end starts the  of the crankshaft movement is approximately  for both pmma and ps and does not reach  per rotation the ability of the crankshaft to rotate  is the basis for the appearance of tg when the temperature exceeds tg all crankshafts in the main chain start moving according to the activation energy in other words if the temperature in the state where all crankshaft movements are actively occurring is gradually lowered the movements in descending order of energy are frozen this means that tg appears when the rotational motion for the crankshaft with the lowest energy is impossible when the temperature is decreased further the rotation angle  of this motion gradually decreases with temperature and the free volume vfc value for one crankshaft rotation  decreases to match vfg which is the phenomenon for the wlf equation the equal free volume fraction fg   was thus reproducedin the next section the rotational motion of the chain end which is historically valid will be clarified and the need for its replacement with the rotational motion of the crankshaft near the chain end will be discussedrotational motion of the crankshaft near the chain end fox et al assumed that the molar volume vp cmmol of the polymer at a constant temperature and pressure for a particular degree of polymerization p is given by vp  vm p  ve where vm is the volume of one monomer unit in the chain and ve is the combined volume of the two chain ends this was based on the work of flory in addition for amorphous polymers such as ps pmma and polyisobutylene pib corresponding to the formula the molecular weight m is given by m  mp  me where m is the molecular weight of an x unit and me is the combined weight of the two chain ends if polymer xp has no foreign ends the me value is zero the specific volume vp cmg of a polymer with a degree of polymerization p is vpm and the following equation gives the value of vpwhere v  vmm is the limiting specific volume for a chain of infinite length thus the physical meaning of the constant k was derived by comparing the empirical formula tg  tg  km theoretically the decrease in molecular weight due to the cleavage of the endless m polymer chain corresponds to an increase in the number of the chain ends and the movement of the end increases the volume which causes an increase in the specific volume as a result tg decreases fox et al expressed the molecular weight m and temperature dependence t k of the specific volume vp using the following empirical formulas based on a large amount of experimental data the second term on the righthand side of equation  is indicative of the increase in vp due to the increase in m that is the increase in the abundance ratio of the terminal me to the degree of polymerization p of the main chain dividing this second term by the molecular weight m of the monomer unit gives the increase in vp per p vem  mem vp here vem is the volume of the end per monomer unit that is the specific volume vpe of the end per monomer unit which is a constant value and mem is the number of monomer units at the end for the degree of polymerization pe as is clear from equation  me is the molecular weight of the fragment added to the main chain which differs depending on the polymerization initiator or terminator it should be noted that the second term expresses the contribution of pe at the chain end to the decrease in p so that vp increases thus the definition of the end is important equation  can be rewritten as figure a shows the vp values calculated using equation  at  c for pmma the mole fractions of the two ends pe   and the main chain ppe with me   contributed to vp the contributions are shown as the relative fraction vfr figure b shows a plot of the true fractions vtr and vp vs m as evident from figure a the vp value of the entire polymer and the relative fraction of the end groups decreased with increasing m on the other hand both values increased linearly for m figure b however it is clear that an increase in the terminal fraction vtr consisting of one monomer unit cannot follow the increase in the vp value of the entire polymer the slope of the plot of vp vs m in figure b is the pe value related to the terminal motion which is the number of monomer units as is clear from equation  the slope at  c indicates that the end is composed of approximately  monomer units figure d shows one crankshaft rotary motion model near the end of a freely rotating chain the persistence length q becomes one segment and one crankshaft consists of five segments from the chain end however the rotational motion works even with three to four segments when the q value is converted to the number of monomer units as shown in figure b   of pmma corresponds to  and   of ps corresponds to  hence this is defined as nmq the number of monomer units pe in equation  involved in the rotational motion of crankshaft near the two ends contributes to the specific volume vp of the entire polymer and is treated as the variable nmq in the estimation the value that matches the slope of the vp vs m plot is determined multiplying the determined nmq value by the molecular weight m of the monomer unit gives the molecular weight mpe near the end involved in the crankshaft rotational motion figure  shows the estimation results of equation  at  c the slope of the estimation result reproduces that of approximately  wells incidentally v   in equation  is the intercept of the plot and is equal to vp of the polymer with the maximum molecular weight m     used in the estimation figure  summarizes the m dependence of vp at other temperatures for pmma the slope was well reproduced by the variable  nmq using equation  at  c  c and  c the results including the mpe value are shown in table  together with the case of ps it is clear from the table that when the temperature rises in both pmma and ps the pe value of the number of monomer units involved in the motion near the end increases that is the range of motion expands it should be stated that pmma involves  pes that is four segments even near room temperature and ps has approximately  pes the number of segments is approximately  which is not one monomer unit at  c in the case of pmma the number was increased to   segments and in the case of ps it increased to   segments the magnification of pmma was slightly lower than that of ps these differences between pmma and ps may be influenced by the dipole interactions in pmma that are not present in pssemiflexible and flexible amorphous monodisperse polymers with a molecular weight m greater than or equal to the molecular weight me between entanglement points behave as gaussian chains and freely interpenetrate to form entanglements it is known that the m dependence of the selfdiffusional coefficient ds in the diffusion motion by reptation follows dsm for example when the characteristic molecular weight mc that exerts the entanglement effect is exceeded in this study the m dependence of the glass transition degree tg which is known as a typical thermal property was investigated in detail as a result tg increases with the increase of m but the rate of increase gradually decreases and approaches the equilibrium value tg however it was revealed that the intermediate molecular weight region me m amc exists by the time tg is reached the coefficient a was approximately  in pmma but ps was approximately  this difference was speculated to be due to the dipole moment of the former carbonyl ester side group furthermore this effect was remarkable at the coefficient of thermal expansion  value which is closely related to the specific volume reciprocal density in other words the rate of decrease in  value below tg was  for ps but  for pmmathe volume of the single strand was estimated as a result for example about  molecular chains with the same m are entangled and incorporated in the random coil chain of pmma with m     at room temperature but approximately  are voids free volume therefore for the micro brownian motion a simple model of the crankshaft motion with the persistence length q which is often used in the kp model chain as one segment is applied and the void volume vfc required by the motion is calculated as a result of a detailed examination of the calculation method of the numerator vfg at the free volume fraction fg  vfg  vog   of tg the denominator vog is related to the last crankshaft of the polymer chain it was found to correspond to the void vfc furthermore it was revealed that this last crankshaft is composed of  to  segments a dozen monomer units existing near the end of the chain from ancient times the doctrine that tg appears from the freezing of the rotational motion of the monomer units at both ends of the chain is modified these results also strongly suggest that the appearance of tg is not due to a decrease in free volume void but to the barrier energy of the temperaturedependent rotational motion of cc bondsmaterials commercially available

Research paper_Journal article,XWBDO_1.docx,Research paper_Journal article,XWBDO_1.docx,safety assessment of nicotinamide mononucleotide overdose in healthy adult men and women a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled parallelgroup studyyuichiro fukamizu yoshiaki uchida akari shigekawa toshiya sato toshiyuki kosaka takanobu sakurai research and development division mitsubishi corporation life sciences limited  yurakucho chiyodaku tokyo  japan recently it has become clear that a decrease in the intracellular level of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad an essential coenzyme for metabolic activities in organisms causes various agingrelated diseases and metabolic abnormalities therefore in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that increasing intracellular nad levels by supplementing with betanicotinamide mononucleotide nmn a precursor of nad alleviates agingrelated diseases and metabolic disorders in recent years clinical trials of nmn have been initiated in humans still there are no reports on the safety of repeated oral administration of excessive doses of nmn exceeding  mg once daily in healthy adult men and women therefore we conducted a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled parallelgroup study to evaluate the safety of  mg of nmn mitsubishi corporation life sciences limited orally once daily for  weeks in  healthy adult men and women  to  years old after oral administration of an excessive amount of nmn no values exceeding physiological variations were observed in each clinical laboratory test furthermore no severe adverse events were observed during the study period our results indicate that nmn is safe and welltolerated in healthy adult men and women up to an oral dose of  mg once dailynicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad has long been known as a coenzyme for various redox reactions in major energygenerating pathways such as glycolysis tca circuitry and betaoxidation nad is used not only in redox reactions but also as a cofactor for the sirtuin family sirt of naddependent deacetylasesdeacylases and adpribose transferases poly adpribose polymerase parp it is also used as a cofactor for cluster of differentiation  cd catalyzes the synthesis and hydrolysis of cyclic adpribose cadpr thus nad is involved in the various biological regulation of organisms such as dna repair posttranslational modification of proteins epigenetic gene regulation mechanisms and circadian rhythms furthermore recent studies have shown that the amount of nad in organs tissues and cells throughout the body decreases with age in mammals decreased nad in vivo reduces the activity of the sirtuin family and parps which require nad as a cofactor and is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of various agerelated and metabolic diseases therefore preventing the decrease in intracellular levels of nad may prevent and treat these agerelated diseases and metabolic disorders because nad is impermeable to cell membranes it is thought that direct administration of nad does not efficiently increase intracellular nad levelstherefore to efficiently increase intracellular nad levels the administration of precursors of the nad biosynthetic pathway has been attemptedthree different metabolic pathways have been identified for nad biosynthesis in organisms the first is the de novo pathway originating from ltryptophan trp the second is the preisshandler pathway originating from nicotinic acid na and the third is the salvage pathway which involves the degradation of nad and subsequent resynthesis of nad from the synthesis of the nad precursors nicotinamide mononucleotide nmn and nicotinamide namthe salvage pathway is the preferential metabolic pathway in mammalian nad biosynthesis and nmn in the salvage pathway can biosynthesize nad via a onestep enzymatic reaction by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase nmnatrecently the existence of an nmn transporter slca has been reported by grozio et al therefore nmn is expected to be an efficient booster to increase the intracellular nad levels in fact in vivo and in vitro studies have reported the efficacy of nmn administration in increasing intracellular levels of nad and against various diseases and disorders including agerelated diseases and metabolic disorders diabetic nephropathy ischemic reperfusion injury brain function reproductive function immune activation hematopoietic effectsin addition nmn has been shown to bind to the sarscov protein suggesting a potential therapeutic effect of nmn in the treatment of covidfurthermore the administration of nmn to rodents has been shown to prolong lifespan and alleviate agerelated physiological declinethus since various beneficial bioactivities of nmn have been reported in vivo and in vitro studies several human clinical trials have been reported in recent years the first evaluated the safety of single oral doses of   and  mg of nmn in healthy men and reported that oral administration of nmn did not produce values exceeding normal physiological fluctuations in hematological and clinical biochemical teststhe second study examined the efficacy of  mgday of nmn orally administered for  weeks in overweight or obese postmenopausal women with prediabetes in improving glucose metabolism it was reported that an average of  improved insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake which is reduced in type  diabetes and its prediabetic patients was significantly improvedthe third study examined the efficacy of oral administration of lowdose  mg twice daily mediumdose  mg twice daily and highdose  mg twice daily nmn on aerobic exercise capacity in healthy male and female amateur runners for  weeks the study reported a dosedependent increase in skeletal muscle oxygen utilization and improvement in aerobic capacity during exercise trainingin these human clinical trials it has been reported that there were no significant changes in body composition or serious adverse events during the study periodprevious human clinical studies with nmn have not reported any evidence of safety in hematological clinical biochemical or urinalysis studies after repeated oral administration of excessive doses of  mg or more once dailytherefore a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled parallelgroup study was conducted to evaluate the safety of nmn mg mitsubishi corporation life science limited when

are shown in table  five adverse events were observed during the study period but in all adverse events the study investigator determined that there was no direct causal relationship to the test foodin this study we evaluated the safety of nmn in overdoses in healthy adult men and women in our study oral administration of excessive amounts of nmn  mg for up to  weeks was safe and welltolerated in healthy adult males and females nmn manufactured by mitsubishi corporation life science inc used in this study did not show mutagenicity in the ames test this result was identical to those reported by cros et al  and supports that nmn is a nonmutagenic compoundhuman clinical studies on the safety of nmn were reported by irie et al in a single oral dose study of nmn  mg  mg and  mg in healthy males which showed the safety of single oral doses up to  mg  in our study no adverse physical effects were observed even after repeated oral administration of  mg once a day an excess dose than the single oral dose of  mg given by irie et al in addition in the study by irie et al only healthy men were tested but in our study healthy men and women were tested the results of our study showed that oral administration of nmn did not show any adverse effects on the body in healthy males as well as healthy femalesin the report by irie et al total serum bilirubin showed a significant increase within clinical laboratory reference values in our study total serum bilirubin was not measured and we could not evaluate the variation of total serum bilirubin during an overdose the results of irie et al showed a significant decrease in creatinine glucose and chloride within the clinical laboratory standard values but in our study unlike the results of irie et al there was no significant decrease in glucose and chloride as for blood creatinine our study showed a significant decrease within the clinical laboratory reference values as reported by irie et al blood creatinine is known to be an indicator of renal function and in the subacute toxicity evaluation of nmn  mgday in beagle dogs by you et al a significant mild increase in blood creatinine was observed in the nmn group based on these results oral administration of high doses of nmn  mgday has been reported to have mild adverse effects on the kidneys of beagle dogs however in the reports by irie et al  mgday and our study  mgday there was no significant increase in blood creatinine with oral administration of nmn therefore we consider that oral administration of nmn to humans has a low adverse effect on renal functionthe human efficacy study by yoshino et al and liao et al also confirmed the supplemental safety assessment with no body composition reports and serious events in our study similar to yoshino et al and liao et al we did not observe any changes in body composition and serious adverse events during study as in yoshino et als study there were no significant changes in blood glucose levels with oral administration of nmn therefore it suggests that nmn can be safely administered orally without altering blood glucose or body compositionnicotinamide nam is an intermediate metabolite of nad in the salvage pathway and like nmn has been reported as an nad booster flux analysis of nad in mice reported by liu et al showed that oral administration of nmn increased nam in the blood high oral doses of nam have been reported to be hepatotoxic to humans and the upper tolerable dose of nam for humans established by the european commission and the uk vitamin and mineral expert group has been set at  mgday in this study we were concerned about hepatotoxicity from the increase of nam in the blood due to excessive intake of nmn but no adverse effects on each liver function item were observed our results indicate that nmn can be orally administered to humans at doses up to  mg once daily without causing hepatotoxicity our study report showed that nmn could be administered orally above the tolerable upper intake level of namon the other hand there are several limitations of our study first metabolomic analysis of nmn and its metabolites such as nad nam nmethylpyridonecarboxamide py and nmethylpyridonecarboxamide py in the blood was not performed during the study period the metabolomic analysis can confirm the bioavailability of nmn and the disposition of nmn metabolites in the body when nmn is overdosed and is expected to provide data further to support the safety of oral administration of nmn second body composition hematological tests clinical biochemical tests and urinalysis were used as criteria for safety in this study in addition to these clinical laboratory tests clinical physiological tests such as mri ecg eeg and if possible histological tests by biopsy should be performed to comprehensively verify the safety of nmn by various clinical laboratory methodsin recent years nmn supplements are already available in the market and are being taken by consumers worldwide as health care products however there is a lack of evidence from human clinical trials and preclinical studies to support the safety of nmn used in those products in this human clinical study nmn manufactured by mitsubishi corporation life sciences limited was shown to be safe and welltolerated up to an oral dose of  mg once daily the results of our human clinical trials have

Response to reviewer comments,YFKA_7_2.docx,Response to reviewer comments,YFKA_7_2.docx,angptl expression is increased in epicardial adipose tissue of patients with coronary artery diseasei propose you enrich the discussion section insisting on the most important papers that presented the ilb function and potential correlations with inflammation and cad also i suggest you write the strengths of this study prior to writing the limitationsresponse we are grateful to reviewer  for their critical comments and useful suggestions that have helped us improve our paper as indicated by the reviewer  we have enriched the discussion and written the strengths of this study before the limitation in the revised version of our paper as followswe found that il in eat was correlated with angptl in eat cantos trial has suggested that the inhibition of il with canakinumab reduces cardiovascular events  some basic studies have revealed the effect on atherosclerosis and mechanism of antiinflammation therapy targeting il  these studies support the importance of ilassociated inflammation in atherosclerosis and cad pages  lines in conclusion we found that angptl expression was increased in the eat of patients with cad and that the expression was positively correlated with that of il this result has a high impact on clarifying the mechanisms by which eat metabolism accelerates atherosclerosis and cad development there are some limitations to the present study the study design was crosssectional and the results do not imply causality firstly we did not perform a regression analysis to exclude other factors secondly we conducted a cohort analysis and excluded the possibility that angptl is not associated with cad development thirdly computer tomographic data of eat showing the volume is lacking fourth the number of samples is not enough for sufficient subgroup analysis further basic and clinical studies are needed to elucidate the interaction of adipokines secreted from eat with the progression of atherosclerosis page  lines this quite interesting manuscript tries to demonstrate the importance of angptl expression in epicardial adipose tissue eat of coronary artery disease cad patients which may offer supportive information in cad development process abstract introduction methods and discussion parts are pretty clear and well written which are crucial for readers i would appreciate the authors for the wellorganized manuscript while focusing on the study subjects its good that most of the patients are nonobese although there are some issues which really need to addressresponse we are grateful to reviewer  for the critical comments and useful suggestions that have helped us improve our paper as indicated in the responses that follow we have taken all these comments and suggestions into account in the revised version of our paperresponse we thank the reviewer for the critical comments on our manuscript the point is very limited our study as described in limitation of discussion section since the study is casecontrol study and eat volume is not general clinical evaluation we could not measure the eat volume of the patientsresponse we thank the reviewer for this comment as per your indication we have corrected the table number in result section in the revised manuscripts page  lines  and  please check line  according to table  lipid profile differences are insignificant isnt trueresponse we thank the reviewer for this comment as per your indication we have checked again the data of table  and the result and p value is trueon table  number of diabetic patients in noncad and cad groups are  and  respectively but why only    and   patients taking antidiabetic mediation in noncad and cad groups respectively do other patients not know about their diabetes would you kindly explain thisresponse we appreciate the reviewers comment the medication for diabetes is dependent on hbac level six patients did not receive the oral hypoglycemic drugs two patients used insulin one patient received emergency surgery and  patients received exercise and diet therapy without drugs all patients understood their diabetes although diabetic patient number difference is insignificant but  subjects of cad group are diabetic which might give false positive outcome correlating this data of table  with table  we can see that ppg and hbac levels are quite significant in cad group as we know not only hyperlipidemia but also hyperglycemia can cause metaflammation which might increase wbc level in cad group p value   is quite close to be significant are significant ppg and hbac levels from cad group due to higher diabetic patients inclusion i think this issue is making the manuscript weakerresponse thank you for valuable comment as the reviewer pointed out the number of patients with diabetes high ppg and hbac levels in cad group is higher than that in noncad group diabetes can cause chronic inflammation in the body and could affect the outcome of this study such as inflammatory cytokines however as shown in below figure angptl expression in eat was also significantly increased in cad patients without diabetes the data suggest that diabetes might not give false positive outcome at least in this studyalthough the number of patients with diabetes in cad group is relatively higher than that in noncad group angptl expression in eat was not significantly altered in the patients with or without diabeteson last line of abstract you mentioned that angptl may be involved in onset of cad its little bit hard to claim this when there is no acute case data i think all of the cad patients in the study belong to chronic cases henceforth expression of inflammatory markers are not high enoughresponse we appreciate the reviewers comment as indicated by the reviewer we have revised this sentence in the revised manuscript as follows on line  please correct the figure number i think its only figure c and on following sentence mention figure number abresponse we appreciate the reviewers comment as indicated by the reviewer we have revised this sentence in the revised manuscript as follows the expression of angptl and  was not significantly different between these groups figure a and b angptl expression was significantly increased in the eat of cad patients compared to that of noncad patients p   figure c page  lines on line  you mentioned that angptl expression is not related with statins and arbs i think this is interesting data i would suggest to include the dataresponse we appreciate the reviewers comment as indicated by the reviewer we have added the data figures g and h in the revised manuscript according to addition of figures g and h we have revised the result section and figure legend as followsthere was no significant difference in angptl expression in eat between patients treated with statins or arbs figures g and h suggesting that these medications were not associated with changes expression in angptl page  linesfigure  angptl and il expression is increased in the epicardial adipose tissue eat of the patients with cad af comparison of the gene expression of angptl and inflammatory cytokine mrna in eat in patients with or without cad twotailed unpaired students ttest was performed between noncad and cad subjects g and h comparison of the gene expression of angptl mrna expression in eat in patients with or without arb g and statin h i linear regression analysis was performed in a combined group including noncad and cad subjects r and p values are shown in the figure page  linesthe role of angptl is evolving depending on cell types the functions of angptl varies some studies have indicated the proinflammatory role of angptl some studies claimed antiinflammatory role of angptl especially focusing on immune cells couple of article links are followingresponse we appreciate the reviewers comment as indicated by the reviewer we have added the description about the multifaced function of angptl in the revised manuscript as follows on the other hand the protective effect of angptl on inflammation and atherosclerosis were reported  the cell and conditionspecific functions of angptl have been clarified in the further studies page  lines thats why the sentence il is known to be a proinflammatory cytokine that progresses to atherosclerosis secreted from macrophages putting the doubt card regarding the role of angptl on the tableresponse we appreciate the reviewers comment the sentence has been removed in the revised manuscript page  line response we appreciate the reviewers comment as indicated by the reviewer we have corrected these figured in the revised manuscript on result section  are you telling about pericardial fluid by mentioning epicardial fluid if so its better to write pericardial fluid to not making confused to the readersresponse we appreciate the reviewers comment as indicated by the reviewer we have corrected these words from epicardial fluid to pericardial fluid in the revised manuscriptthus we evaluated the angptl and il concentrations in the pericardial fluid of the patients angptl protein levels in pericardial fluid did not increase in patients with cad figure a and b however il concentration was significantly higher in cad patients than in noncad patients figure c il concentration in pericardial fluid was correlated with its expression in eat r   p   figure c page  lines response thank you for valuable comment no as shown in above figure response about comment   of top are not diabetic patients and  of top  patients are diabetic patientson line  you mentioned about angptl level measurement from plasma i think this data is missing or misinformative would you kindly check the dataresponse thank you for valuable comment we determined plasma angptl concentration as well as pericardial fluid by elisa but the data are not shown in our paper plasma angptl levels were not significantly differed between noncad and cad groups the data suggest that angplt functions locally at the eat and coronary arteryhowever in our study the plasma angptl and tg levels were not changed between cad and noncad patients data not shown page  lines i think either you need to exclude diabetic hyperglycemic patients from the study or focus only diabetic population if needed increase the subject numbers somehow it seems that this data would possibly correlate with diabetic cad patientswe appreciate and agree the reviewers comment as the reviewer suggested subgroup analysis is important for this study however the number of samples was not enough to perform sufficient subgroup analysis focusing on diabetes and metabolic syndromes we have added the limitation as follows

Others,YIWFU_9.docx,Other,YIWFU_9.docx,in this chapter we propose the standardization of lowpowerloss designs for highspeed gear systems and describe the contribution of this research to the basis of the standardization referring to the standardization of existing gear strength designsin order to consider the requirements for the standardization of lowloss designs for highspeed gear systems reference is made to the already established standardization of gear strength designs figure  a shows the standardization of the gear strength design the outline of the gear strength design standards is described below based on the clarification of gear failure phenomena the phenomena are classified into tooth surface fatigue tooth surface scuffing and tooth root bending failure classification of gear damage in fig  a as a standard experimental measurement method for example the fzg gear standard experimental method has been established standard experimental methods in fig  a the strength design standard has been established based on the analysis and classification of gear failure phenomena and experimental data using standard experimental methods development of strength design standard in fig  afor example agma  provides design criteria for tooth surface strength and tooth bending strength and agma  provides design criteria for tooth surface scuffing the established design standards are updated based on the results of application to actual gearbox development update of strength design standard in fig  afor example agma d which is an update of the design standards for tooth surface strength and tooth bending strength specifies a method for evaluating tooth surface strength and tooth bending strength and shows factors and calculation methods that affect gear life agma a which is an update of the standards for tooth surface scuffing shows the effect of oil lubrication on tooth surface damage such as tooth surface scuffing and abrasionas described above it can be seen that clarification and classification of phenomena development of standard experimental measurement methods development of design standards and update of design standards are necessary for design standardizationsince the power loss of a highspeed gear system is classified into fluid dynamic loss and gear friction loss standardization of lowloss design is considered for each the standardization of lowloss design for highspeed gear systems is shown in fig  b classification is made based on the clarification of fluid dynamic loss phenomena clarification and classification of fluid dynamic loss phenomena fig  b this corresponds to the clarification and classification of the phenomena in the standardization of the gear strength design classification of gear damage in fig  a a standard experimental measurement method of fluid dynamic loss is established standard experimental methods to measure fluid dynamic loss in fig  b this corresponds to the standard experimental measurement method in the standardization of gear strength design standard experimental methods in fig  a a fluid dynamic loss model is developed based on the clarification and classification of fluid dynamic loss phenomena and on experimental data using standard experimental methods development of fluid dynamic loss models in fig  b this corresponds to the design criteria in the standardization of gear strength design development of strength design standard in fig  athe difference from the gearstrength design standard is that it is difficult to set the standard for fluid dynamic loss according to various gearbox design conditions so it is necessary to use a fluid dynamic loss model which must be adaptable to various gearbox design conditions and have the same reliability as the gearstrength design the developed fluid dynamic loss model needs to be updated based on the results of application to actual gearbox development update of power loss models in fig  bregarding the standardization of lowloss design of gear friction loss by conventional researches eg   as shown in fig  b clarification and classification of gear friction loss phenomena standard experimental methods to measure gear friction loss and development of gear friction loss models have been generally establishedfrom the above since the standardization of gear friction loss has been generally established in conventional researches it is considered that the standardization of lowloss design will be possible by progressing the standardization of lowloss design of fluid dynamic lossthe following shows the contribution of the results of this research to the standardization of lowloss designregarding the clarification and classification of phenomena of fluid dynamic losses in the clarification and

examples of low power loss design to demonstrate the effectiveness of fluid dynamic loss model and  contribution to standardization of lowloss design of highspeed gear systemsin this research the phenomena at the gear contact surface was observed in the minimal area of the tooth surface contact line with hertz contact width and it was shown that the region around the gear could be divided into the phenomena at the gear contact surface and the phenomena in the region around the gear except for the gear contact surface the fluid dynamic loss in this research was the loss caused by the phenomena in the region around the gear except for the gear contact surfacea as a numerical simulation method to clarify the phenomena of fluid dynamic loss a rectangular grid system was used as a calculation grid system the volume of fluid vof method was used as a calculation method for the gasliquid interface and the porosity method was used for the modeling of the object boundary the mass conservation equation and the momentum conservation equation were set as equations common in oil and air onefluid model and the condition that there is no velocity slip was used between the gasliquid interface the object movement was modeled in terms of the changes in the volume of the fluid air and oil part in the cell and in the fluid area of the cell surface the shear stress at the wall surface was calculated from the difference between the object velocity and the fluid velocity and the turbulent flow model the large eddy simulation les method was used for the turbulent flow model because of the numerical stability the fluid dynamic loss was obtained by integrating the pressure and shear force on the gear tooth surfaceb in order to validate the numerical simulation of fluid dynamic loss we used a axis helical gearbox in which the motor drives the input gear shaft via a torque meter and the output gear shaft is free no load in order to improve the measurement accuracy of fluid dynamic loss insitu measurement of the friction losses of the gears the bearings and the seals by controlling the internal pressure of the gearbox and adjusting the temperature of the bearing and the seal was carried outas a result the measurement error of the friction loss can be sufficiently reduced the measurement error can be reduced equivalent to the measurement error of the torque meterc regarding the fluid dynamic loss of air and oil the aerodynamic loss and the oil dynamic loss the trends of the simulation results and the experimental results agreed therefore it was found that the numerical simulation results can be applied to clarify the phenomena of fluid dynamic lossa as a modeling method of the simulation for airflow in order to ensure numerical stability a clearance was provided for the tooth surface in contact surface between the actual gearsb in order to validate the airflow in the gear meshing part the air pressure in the tip clearance at gear meshing was validated as a result the numerical simulation reproduced the trend of the pressure increase in the intomesh and the pressure decrease in the outofmesh on the other hand the magnitude of the pressure decrease in the outofmesh was lowered by the influence of the provided clearance between the gear tooth surfaces this difference is approximately comparable to a practical error when evaluated in terms of the force loaded on the gear therefore it is considered that the difference does not affect the applicability of the numerical simulationc in order to validate the airflow around the gear except for the gear meshing part the aerodynamic loss in the single gears was validated as a result the numerical simulation could reproduce the aerodynamic loss in the single gears and the trend of loss reduction rate by shroudingd since the trend of the numerical simulation of the airflow agreed with that of the experimental result it was proven that the numerical simulation result could be applied to the clarification of the fluid dynamic loss phenomenaa as modeling methods of simulation for oil flow this research shows the coarse graining concept in which momentum transfer of oil in a calculation grid can be modeled by an approach of coarse graining of oil particles a simple modeling method of oil jet for reducing the number of calculation grids and a method for improving simulation accuracy by considering a phenomenon in which flow drag coefficient in twophase flow is lower than that in a single phase flowb in order to validate the simulation results of the oil flow we used the measurement method for oil fraction and mixture velocity and the oil flow visualization method in the measurement method for oil fraction and mixture velocity we applied the isokinetic suction method which has been applied to dust measurement to twophase air and oil flows and confirmed that the method has practical accuracy in the oil flow visualization method we measured the velocity of oil particles using an air purge mechanism that eliminates the effect of oil mist and a borescope equipped with a light source as a result the visualization results were consistent with the measurement results of oil fraction and mixture velocity and the visualization method was confirmed to validc in order to validate the oil flow in the gear meshing part the flow of oil jet into the gear meshing part was validated as the result the simulation result reproduced the trend of the experimental result on the visualization experimental results of the oil outflow from the gear mesh in low rotational speed and the entrainment of the oil jet into the gear mesh in high rotational speedd in order to validate the oil flow around the gear the oil spray flow to the gear tooth surface was validated as a result the simulation results reproduced the trends of the experimental results for visualizing the spray reaching the gear valley at low rotational speed and nonreaching at high rotational speede in order to validate the oil flow near the shroud wall the oil fraction mixture velocity and oil flow velocity between the gear tooth tip and the shroud wall were validated as a result the simulation results reproduced the experimental results concerning the trend of the oil fraction to be large near the shroud wall the trend of the flow velocity near the tooth tip to be high and the trend of the flow velocity to decrease as it approaches the shroud wall and the trend of the flow velocity to have a peak value a little away from the shroud wallf since the trend of the numerical simulation of the oil flow agreed with that of the experimental result it was proven that the numerical simulation results could be applied to the clarification of the fluid dynamic loss phenomenaa as a result of clarifying the phenomena of the aerodynamic loss it was found that torque is generated by the pushing out and sucking in of airflow in the gear meshing part torque is generated by the vortex flow generated in the gear tooth valley in the gear peripheral part and that shrouding reduces torque by suppressing these flowsb as a result of clarifying the phenomena of the oil dynamic loss it was found that torque was generated at the gear meshing part due to the acceleration of supplied oil and reinflow of oil the torque was generated at the gear peripheral part due to the winding up of oil adhering to the gear tooth surface and the inflow of oil into the tooth surface and that the shrouding increased torque by increasing the amount of oil around the gearc it was found that the aerodynamic loss is reduced by shrouding while the oil dynamic loss is increasedd the classification of fluid dynamic losses is carried out based on the clarification of the phenomena as a result aerodynamic loss was classified into air sideflow loss due to airflow passing through the sides of the gear meshing part air pumping loss due to airflow passing through the tip clearance and backlash in the gear meshing part and air vortex loss due to vortex in the gear peripheral partthe oil dynamic loss was classified into oiljet acceleration loss by the acceleration of the oil supplied to the gear meshing part oil reacceleration loss by the acceleration of the oil flowing into the gear meshing part again and oil churning loss by the oil churning in the gear peripheral part development of fluid dynamic loss model based on the clarification and classification of fluid dynamic loss phenomena and understand of main parameters of the lossthe air drag coefficient is affected by the helix angle of the gear teeth and the number of shroud openings the main parameters are the air drag coefficient air density tooth area and peripheral speedb the air pumping loss is modeled as a loss due to the acceleration of the air in the tip clearance and backlash this loss is negligible because the mass flow rate of the air accelerated in the tip clearance and backlash is smallc in order to model the air vortex loss the gear is considered to be a rotating cylinder and the rotational moment coefficient on gear periphery and the rotational moment coefficient on gear sides are defined the rotational moment coefficient on gear periphery is affected by the rotational reynolds number and the ratio of the module to the gear radius the rotational moment coefficient on gear sides is affected by the rotational reynolds numberthe effect of reducing air vortex loss by shrouding is considered to be the suppression of the flow structure on the peripheral and side surfaces of the gear and the loss reduction rate due to the shrouding is defined as the shroud coefficient the shroud coefficient is affected by the radial and axial clearances between the gear and shroud and the peripheral opening angle of the shroudthe main parameters of air vortex loss are air density tooth area peripheral speed and shroud coefficient that are derived from the equation of moment coefficient on gear periphery where the loss is larger than on the gear sidesd the oiljet acceleration loss is modeled as a loss that accelerates the oil supplied to the gear meshing to the gear peripheral speed the main parameters are the oil supply flow rate and the peripheral speede the oil reacceleration loss is modeled as a loss that accelerates the mass flow rate of the oil reflowing into the gear meshing to the gear peripheral speed the oil reacceleration coefficient is defined as the reinflow flow rate  oil supply flow rate and is affected by the peripheral opening angle and shroud coefficient the main parameters are the oil reacceleration coefficient  reinflow flow rate  oil supply flow rate oil supply flow rate and peripheral speedthe more the gear is shrouded by the shroud the smaller the shroud coefficient the more oil stagnates inside the shroud this was considered in the oil reacceleration loss modelf the oil churning loss was modeled by multiplying the air vortex loss by a magnification oil mist coefficient as a loss due to churning of oil mist around the gear the oil mist coefficient is affected by the oil supply flow rate and the shroud coefficient the main parameters are oil mist coefficient and air vortex lossthe oil churning loss model takes into account the effect that the more the gear is shrouded the more oil stagnates inside the shroud study of the influence of design parameters on fluid dynamic loss and examples of low power loss design to demonstrate the effectiveness of fluid dynamic loss model optimizations of gar aspect ratio and shroud shapesi in the parameter study of the fluid dynamic loss model the trend of the elements of the fluid dynamic loss model was validated using the experimental classification method of the loss or the numerical classification method of the loss and the reliability of the results of the study was ensuredii it was found that the cause of the increase in loss with increasing rotational speed peripheral speed is the increase in aerodynamic loss and oil dynamic loss due to the increase in peripheral speediii it was found that the cause of the increase in loss with increasing oil supply flow rate is the increase in oil dynamic loss due to the increases of oil supply flow rate and oil mist coefficientiv when the gear diameter is increased the aerodynamic loss and the oil dynamic loss increase due to the increase in the peripheral speed when the gear width is increased the aerodynamic loss increases due to the increase in the tooth area and the oil dynamic loss increases due to the increase in the oil reacceleration coefficient oil mist coefficient and tooth area the fluid dynamic loss increases more when the gear diameter is increased than when the gear width is increasedv increasing the gear aspect ratio reduces the aerodynamic loss and the oil dynamic loss by decreasing the peripheral speedvi increasing the radial clearance increases the aerodynamic loss by increasing the shroud coefficient and decreases the oil dynamic loss by decreasing the oil reacceleration coefficient the same applies to increasing the axial clearance and increasing the shroud opening angle while increasing the shroud opening phase does not change the aerodynamic loss and only reduces the oil dynamic lossvii when the air pressure is lowered the aerodynamic loss and the oil dynamic loss decrease due to the decrease of air densityi regarding the optimization of the gear aspect ratio when the gear aspect ratio is increased the gear friction loss increases but the fluid dynamic loss decreases and it was found that an optimum value exists for the gear aspect ratioii with respect to the shroud optimization it was found that there is an optimum value for the shroud coefficient because the increase in the shroud coefficient increases the aerodynamic loss but the decrease in the oil dynamic loss in the case of the axis helical gear studied in this research the optimum shroud coefficient is approximately    which minimizes the fluid dynamic lossa in order to standardize lowloss designs for highspeed gear systems clarification and classification of phenomena standard experimental measurement methods fluid dynamic loss model with applicability and reliability and update of loss models based on application results are required by analogy with already established standardization of gear strength designsb in this research we proposed clarification and classification of phenomena standard experimental measurement method and fluid dynamic loss model and showed their effectivenessthat is this research is considered to have constructed the basis of the standardization of the low loss design of the high speed gear systemfigure  shows the key points for the clarification of the phenomena of fluid dynamic loss and the key points of lowloss design that obtained in this researchthe answers to the key points of clarification of the phenomena of fluid dynamic loss and the key points of lowloss design that described in chapter  section  as raising the problems in this research are summarized below classification of fluid dynamic loss based on clarification of the loss for understanding fluid dynamic loss phenomena a in fig a the aerodynamic loss is classified into air sideflow loss air pumping loss and air vortex lossd the oil dynamic loss is classified into oiljet acceleration loss oil reacceleration loss and oil churning losse the oiljet acceleration loss and oil reacceleration loss are losses generated at the gear meshing part development of fluid dynamic loss model for understanding fluid dynamic loss phenomena and understanding of main parameters of loss a in fig a the main parameters of air sideflow loss are air drag coefficient peripheral speed tooth area and air densityc the main parameters of air vortex loss are shroud coefficient peripheral speed tooth area and air densityd the main parameters of the oiljet acceleration loss are the peripheral speed and the oil supply flow ratee the main parameters of oil reacceleration loss are oil reacceleration coefficient peripheral speed and oil supply flow ratea in optimizing the gear aspect ratio the relationship between the strength and weight of the gear is approximately proportional to the diameter  tooth width can be used when the failure mode due to tooth surface fatigue is dominantb when the gear aspect ratio is increased with the diameter  tooth width constant the friction loss at the gear contact surface increases mainly due to the increase in the area of the gear tooth surface and the fluid dynamic loss decreases mainly due to the decrease in gear peripheral speed because these trends are opposite there is an optimum value for the gear aspect ratio the optimum value is affected by the mission profile of the aircraft operation air pressure transmitted power and rotational speeda the shroud shape can be optimized relatively freely because it is lightweight using light materials and easy to installb reducing the shroud coefficient reduces the aerodynamic loss by suppressing the vortex structure of the air while increasing the oil dynamic loss by deteriorating the ability of the oil to discharge therefore an optimum value exists for the shroud coefficientthe optimum shroud coefficient for the axis helical gearbox used in this research was about   here the comparison of the fluid dynamic loss model and model coefficients constructed in this research with the conventional research is shown in table  this table summarizes the details described in chapter  fluid dynamic loss model using table  shown in section  raising problems as for the aerodynamic loss at the gear meshing part no model is seemed to be found in the existent study therefore a new model and model coefficient were suggested in this research as a result the air sideflow loss power loss due to flow through the side of gear mesh and the air pumping loss power loss due to flow in the tip clearance and backlash at the gear mesh were newly defined for the air sideflow loss the air drag coefficient was newly defined and the coefficients were identified using the axis helical gear box in this research for the air pumping loss the theoretical formula of the oiljet acceleration loss was applied and theoretically determined regarding the oil dynamic loss in the gear meshing part a theoretical equation and an experimental coefficient of oil acceleration loss have been proposed in the existent researches in this study the existent equation for the oil acceleration loss was divided into the part that can be evaluated by the theoretical equation and the part that requires the experimental coefficient and the former is defined as oiljet acceleration loss and the latter is defined as the oil reacceleration loss as for the experimental coefficient there seems to be no equation that can take the shroud effect into account so we newly defined an experimental formula of the coefficient in this research and validated it using the axis helical gearbox as for the aerodynamic loss at the gear peripheral part an empirical equation and coefficients have been proposed in an existent research then in this research the empirical equation and the coefficients were newly reconstructed using a general rotational moment coefficient for the shroud effect a new empirical equation was developed in this research using the experimental results of the existent research regarding the oil dynamic loss in the gear peripheral part an equation that multiplies the aerodynamic loss in the gear peripheral part by a coefficient has been proposed in existent researches on the other hand an experimental equation for the coefficient is not seem to be found in this research an experimental formula for the coefficient was newly developed including the effect of shroud and validated using the axis helical gearboxthe strictly effective ranges of the numerical simulation method and the loss model proposed in this research is limited to the range experimentally validated the axis helical gearbox used for the validation of fluid dynamic loss in this research is shown in fig  gear specifications shroud parameters and operating conditions are shown in table  a dimensionless evaluation of the experimental conditions is shown in fig  the horizontal axis is set to the rotational reynolds number dimensionless number of rotational speed and the vertical axis is set to the dimensionless oil supply flow rate in fig  the critical reynolds number start reynolds number for turbulent transition    and the transition reynolds number end reynolds number for turbulent transition     for a rotating disk are shown considering that the conditions used in this research are roughly in the range of the transition reynolds number and that the gear is easier to transit to turbulent because of its convexity than the disk the experimental conditions used in this research are considered to be in the range of turbulent flow it is considered that the numerical simulation results validated in the range of table  give a practically reasonable result within a practical error of   as long as the conditions are within the experimentally validated rangein order to study the influence of the design parameters of the gearbox sections    and to study the practical example of the low power loss design of the gearbox chapter  the range validated by the experiment was extended and studied by the fluid dynamic loss model the range of the extended parameters is shown in table the results of the fluid dynamic loss model with the parameters of table  have been validated by numerical simulation the numerical simulation method has been experimentally validated in the range of table  and the conditions in table  outside that range is close to the range of the experimental validation in table  therefore the results of the fluid dynamic loss model are considered to have a certain degree of reliabilitystandardization of low power loss design enables rational design based on actual phenomena as described in chapter  its effectiveness has been as described in examples of low power loss design of gearbox chapter as a future perspective it is considered that the standardization of low power loss design will be applied from a helical gear pair targeted in this research to other gear types the trend of fluid dynamic loss may differ depending on the gear type difference from the helical gear a schematic diagram of the difference in the trend of fluid dynamic loss when the knowledge of fluid dynamic loss obtained in this research is applied to other gear types is shown in fig figure  a shows the helical gear on which the trend of fluid dynamic loss is based the locations where fluid dynamic loss occurs are the gear meshing part and the gear peripheral part in the case of a helical gear pair there is one gear meshing part and the gear peripheral part around it a spur gear pair is considered to be similar as the helical gear pairfigure  b shows a schematic diagram of the trend of fluid dynamic loss of a bevel gear pair like a helical gear pair the bevel gear pair has one gear meshing part and two gear peripheral parts around the gear meshing part on the other hand the bevel gear pair is considered to have larger pumping work air suction of air from the inner diameter side and air discharge to the outer diameter side of the gear at the gear peripheral part than a helical gear pair therefore fluid dynamic loss generated at the gear peripheral part is considered to increasefigure  c shows a schematic diagram of the trend of fluid dynamic loss in a spur gear train the spur gear train is a gear train with multiple parallel axes in the spur gear train the number of gear meshing increases and that is considered to increase the fluid dynamic loss at the gear meshing partsfigure  d shows a schematic diagram of the fluid dynamic loss trend of a planetary gear system the planetary gear system consists of a sun gear in the center multiple gears meshing with the sun gear planetary gears and a ring gear inscribed with the multiple gears in the planetary gear system the fluid dynamic loss generated at the gear meshing part is considered to increase because of the multiple gear meshing in addition the fluid dynamic loss generated at the gear peripheral part is considered to increase because the direction of tooth movements are opposite on the tooth surfaces where the planetary gears are close to each otherthe trends of fluid dynamic loss elements in the gear types shown above are summarized in table  when fluid dynamic loss generated in the gear meshing part increases as shown in fig  air sidelow loss oil supply acceleration loss and oil reacceleration loss increase the air pumping loss is negligible because it is sufficiently small when fluid dynamic loss generated in the gear peripheral part increases air vortex loss and oil churning loss increaseby applying the knowledge on fluid dynamic loss obtained in this research the details of the features shown in fig  and table  will be disclosed and this will contribute to the standardization of the low loss design of these gearsfuture engines may include improvement of the efficiency of engines equipped with the current fan drive gear system for small and mediumsized aircraft   and expansion of the application of the fan drive gear system to engines for medium and large aircraft improvement of the efficiency of engines equipped with the current fan drive gear system for small and mediumsized aircraft includes increasing the fan diameter and  or increasing the turbine speed and changing the fan to an open rotor in both cases efficiency is improved by increasing the bypass ratioto increase the fan diameter and  or increase the turbine speed it is necessary to increase the speed reduction ratio of the gear system  turbine speed  fan speed to increase the reduction ratio it is effective to change from the startype epicyclic gear system fix a carrier of the planetary gears and drive the fan with the ring gear used in the current geared turbofan to the planetarytype epicyclic gear system fix the ring gear and drive the fan with a planetary carrier  in the case of an open rotor fan a planetary gear system is installed between the front propeller and the rear propeller and the sun gear which receives the turbine driving force drives the front fan connected to the planetary carrier and the rear fan connected to the ring gear in this case the gear system deceleration ratio also increases therefore in order to improve the efficiency of engines equipped with a fan drive gear system the reduction ratio of the gear system increases and in general the transmission efficiency decreases as the reduction ratio increases therefore the standardization of the lowpowerloss design proposed in this research is considered to be effectivein expansion of the application of the fan drive gear system to engines for medium and large aircraft the transmitted power of the gear system increases the power loss increases as transmitted power increases therefore the standardization of low power loss design proposed in this research is considered to be effective possibility of contribution to future engines equipped with an accessory gearbox applicable for largecapacity power generationin current engines the accessory gearbox is powered by the highpressure turbine shaft to drive power generators and other auxiliary equipment however the increasing electrification of the airframe requires large capacity power generation and the extracting of power from the highpressure turbine shaft is approaching its limit if too much power is extracted from the highpressure turbine shaft the rotation of the highpressure shaft may become unstable especially in idle conditionto solve this problem it is conceivable to extract power from the lowpressure turbine shaft of the engine on the other hand the range of the rotational speed of the lowpressure turbine shaft is wider than that of the highpressure turbine shaft for example the rotation range of the lowpressure turbine shaft is about  and that of the highpressure turbine shaft is about   if the rotational speed of the generator power generation frequency varies in the wide range it becomes difficult to design an electrical system therefore a gear system equipped with a mechanism that converts the rotational speed such as a clutch or a transmission mechanism is required to keep the rotational speed of the generator within a realistic rangeideas for the speed conversion gear system include a mechanism that drives a generator from each shaft of the engine via a speed reducer  and a mechanism that connects a generator connected to a highpressure turbine shaft and a generator connected to a lowpressure turbine shaft via a transmission mechanism  in both ideas increasing the efficiency of the gear system is important because power loss increases with the addition of gear systems therefore standardization of the lowpowerloss design proposed in this research is considered to be effectivesimple estimation equations for fluid dynamic loss and a simple design method for optimum shroud shapessimple equations

the dimensionless number of the oil supply flow rate qs dimensionless oil supply flow ratethe above equation was constructed from the results of the axis helical gearbox experiment in this research refer section  for the range of conditions therefore when the equation is applied beyond the range of these experiments it is necessary to separately validate it by experiment or by numerical

table belowthe above equations were constructed from dawsons experimental results of the effect of shrouds on a single spur gear  therefore when the equation is applied beyond the range of this experiment it is necessary to validate it separately by experiment or by numerical simulation validated by experimentthe following is a simplified design method of the shroud that minimizes fluid dynamic loss optimal shroud under the conditions of the axis helical gearbox in this research see section  for details the sum of radial relative clearance rr eq a and axial relative clearance rx eq a

operating conditions and i is on the influence of the shroud coefficientof the parameters of eqs a and a the helix angle  was excluded because the change in air sideflow loss was large and therefore the error was large in the simple estimation equationin the influence of the parameters of the gear shape figs a a to d all the parameters affect the fluid dynamic loss but the influence of the gear width is relatively large to increase the operating torque one of the parameters of gear shape in a gear width b gear diameter or c tooth height should be increased therefore increasing the operating torque increases the fluid dynamic lossin the influence of fluid density figs a e and f the influence of air density was large in the influence of operating conditions figs a g and h the influence of gear peripheral speed was relatively large in the influence of the shroud coefficient fig a i the influence of the shroud coefficient was relatively small compared to the other parameters this is because the oil supply flow rate was high under the conditions of table a  and the influence of increased oil dynamic loss due to the installation of the shroud became largethe results of this section have not been validated by either experiment or numerical simulation so the results obtained should be carefully treated for example by conducting validation separatelypower losses in other parts of the gearbox include power losses in bearings rolling bearings and journal bearings power losses in seals and power losses in oil pumps the methods for calculating these losses and their characteristics are described belowthe simplified equation of palmgren  regarding the power loss pbr of rolling bearings is shown in the following equationwhere tbr is the friction torque f is the coefficient related to the bearing f is the coefficient related to the lubrication method oil is the kinematic viscosity of the oil dpb is the pitch circle diameter of the bearing and fb is the loadfrom eq b it can be seen that the power loss pbr is proportional to the  power of the rotation speed n as shown in the following equationregarding the temperature dependence of the power loss of rolling bearings from pbroil in eq b it can be seen that the kinematic viscosity of oil changes and the power loss of rolling bearings changes when the temperature changesthe power loss pbj of a journal bearing and the load capacity wj of the bearing can be obtained by solving the reynolds equation using the shortwidth assumption and the halfsommerfeld condition eg where b is the bearing width rj is the bearing radius vj is the surface speed of the bearing proportional to the rotational speed cj is the radial clearance of the bearing and  is the eccentricity ratio   e  cj e is the eccentricity equation b becomes the following equation when the order is evaluated with   xhere if the load capacity wj is constant then xvj using this result the order evaluation of eq b gives the following equationfrom the above it can be seen that the power loss pbj of the journal bearing is proportional to the th power of the surface speed vj of the bearing proportional to the th power of the rotation speedregarding the temperature dependence of the power loss of the journal bearing from pbjoil in eq b it can be seen that the kinematic viscosity of the oil changes and the power loss of the journal bearing changes when the temperature changesin general the material and shape of seals are designed so that the friction coefficient does not increase significantly as the rotational speed increases an example of mechanical seals are shown in fig b a seal ring is attached to the rotary shaft and a mating ring is attached to the housing by pressing the seal ring against the mating ring with a spring sealing performance is demonstrated power loss is generated by friction between the rings at this time an examples of power loss is shown in fig b  the power loss equation for this seal is shown in the following equationwhere pseal is the pressure difference of the seal kseal is the balance distribution coefficient pspring is the pressure generated by the spring vslide is the sliding speed of the contact surface proportional to the rotational speed aslide is the area of the contact surface and fseal is the friction coefficient in fig b kseal and pspring were kept constant figure b shows that the power loss increases in proportion to the increase in the rotational speed and that the power loss increases as the shaft diameter increases and the pressure difference increases in this example the power loss of the seal is proportional to the rotational speedwith regard to the temperature dependence of the power loss of the seal eq b shows that the temperature dependence of the power loss is small on the other hand if thermal deformation occurs due to the temperature change of the gear shaft and housing and the extension of the spring changes the power loss of the seal may change due to the change of the spring loadthe calculation method for power loss of an external gear pump which is commonly used as an oil pump for aircraft engines is showna schematic diagram of an external gear pump is shown in fig b  oil sucked from the pump inlet is discharged from the pump outlet through the outside of a pair of meshing gearsmanring et al  divided the efficiency gp of the external gear pump into the torque efficiency gpt and the volumetric efficiency gpv and made it a function of oil viscosity oil  rotational angular velocity   differential pressure pgp at the inlet and outlet of the pump first the efficiency gp of the pump is shown by the following equationthe pump efficiency ngp can be divided into the torque efficiency gpt and the volume efficiency gpvthe volumetric efficiency gpv and the torque efficiency gpt are modeled by the following equationswhere cv is the coefficient related to the influences of fluid compressibility and leakage at low reynolds number cv is the coefficient related to leakage at high reynolds number ct is the coefficient related to torque loss at startup ct is the coefficient for the coulomb friction torque loss which is proportional to the load applied to the inside of the pump and ct is the coefficient for fluid dynamic torque loss caused by fluid frictionmichael et al  obtained the empirical equations for volumetric efficiency gpv and torque efficiency gpt from the experimental results of actual gear pumps discharge flow rate is    cc rotational speed is    rpm the differential pressure between inlet and outlet is    mpa which are shown belowoil supply pumps for aeroengine gearboxes have high rotational speed for miniaturization in addition the rotation speed of the pump also varies with the changing of the engine speed for example if the kinematic viscosity of the oil is  mms the density is  kgm the rotation speed is  to  rpm and the pump discharge pressure is  mpa set to constant for simplification oil  pgp     to   fig b volumetric mechanical and overall efficiency curves representative of external gear pumps for  to cc displacement  to rpm speed and  to mpa differential pressurethe volumetric efficiency in this range is approximately constant as shown in fig b therefore the volumetric flow rate discharged by the pump is approximately proportional to the rotational speed even when the rotational speed changes the power consumed by the pump under these conditions is calculated from eqs b to b to be  kw  lmin  mpa to  kw  lmin  mpausing the pump power as pgp calculate the rotational speed proportional exponent using eq b pump flow rate qgpgpv vgp  eq b and pump discharge pressure pgpqgp general piping pressure lossfigure b shows the results of calculating the coefficients gpv  gp from fig b eqs b b and bfigure b  shows that the coefficient gpv  gp is approximately on the order of  therefore from eq b the power for driving the pump is roughly proportional to the cube of the rotational speedthe features of power loss by each loss element gear contact surfaces air and oil flows bearings seals oil pump in the gearbox are summarized focusing on the rotational speed peripheral speed proportional exponents figure b shows the rotational speed exponent of the power loss for the loss element for comparison fig b also shows the rotational speed proportional exponent of  of the aerodynamic loss and the rotational speed proportional exponent of  to  of the oil dynamic loss as a simple calculation method of power loss at the gear contact surface section  shows a method using the average friction coefficient on the tooth surface in this calculation equation power loss at the gear contact surface is proportional to the th power of the rotational speed peripheral speed for the loss due to the flow of air and oil in the gearbox fluid dynamic loss the aerodynamic loss is proportional to the cube of rotational speed and the oil dynamic loss is proportional to the   th power of rotation speed the power loss in rolling bearings is proportional to the th power of the rotational speed according to the empirical equation and the power

Research paper_Journal article,YOOH_62_3.docx,Research paper_Journal article,YOOH_62_3.docx,association of minimum apparent diffusion coefficient value in pirads  or  lesions with clinically significant prostate cancer in the transition zoneashita ono takeshi hashimoto toshihide shishido yosuke hirasawa naoya satake kazunori namiki kazuhiro saito yoshio ohnopurpose this study investigated the association between apparent diffusion coefficients in prostate imaging reporting and data system pirads  lesions and clinically significant prostate cancer gleason score  in the transition zonematerials and methods we included  patients who underwent transperineal cognitive fusion targeted biopsy for pirads  lesions in the transition zone of the prostate between  and  the association between apparent diffusion coefficients and prostate cancers in the transition zone was analyzedresults the detection rate of prostate cancer was   including clinically significant prostate cancer in   of patients the minimum apparent diffusion coefficients in patients with clinically significant prostate cancer were  ms which was significantly lower than  ms in patients with benign histology or clinically insignificant prostate cancer age prostate volume transition zone volume greatest dimension of target lesion mean adc value and minimum adc value were significantly associated with cspc multivariate analysis demonstrated that minimum adc value odds ratio  p   as well as transition zone volume and greatest dimension of target lesion were independent predictors of cspc a minimum apparent diffusion coefficient of  ms was the optimal cutoff value for predicting clinically significant prostate cancer in lesions classified as  in the transition zone conclusions the minimum apparent diffusion coefficient value was associated with the presence of clinically significant prostate cancer in the transition zone and may be useful for considering subsequent biopsies in patients with pirads  lesions and initial negative targeted biopsyprostate cancer pc is the fourth most common cancer globally and  million new cases were diagnosed in  the national comprehensive cancer network guidelines for early detection of pc recommends multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging mri before biopsy moreover the introduction of the prostate imaging reporting and data system pirads has improved detection of clinically significant pc cspc however the detection rate of cspc has been reported to be as low as  in pirads  lesions and  in pirads  lesions therefore we often encounter patients with pirads  lesions and an initial negative targeted biopsy and there is a need to understand how to manage such patients in some cases followup with a repeat mri may be necessary while others may need an immediate repeat biopsyseveral reports have demonstrated that the apparent diffusion coefficient adc values are useful for detecting several types of cancer  regarding pc there have been reports that adc values of cancer tissue were significantly lower than those of normal peripheral zone pz tissue specifically suspicious lesions in the pz with adc values below  ms are more likely to represent pc however the reference adc value for predicting pc in the transition zone tz remains unclear this study aims to investigate the association of adc values in pirads  lesions and cspc in the tz of the prostate as well as the followup of patients with pirads  lesions in the tz and initial negative targeted biopsythis retrospective study was conducted according to the ethical guidelines for clinical studies of the ministry of health labor and welfare of japan and approved by the ethics committee of our facility no t we reviewed the records of  patients with pirads  lesions who underwent targeted transperineal prostate biopsy at tokyo medical university hospital between january  and july  fortyfour patients with pirads  lesions in only the pz or whose medical records were insufficient for analysis were excluded from the present study finally  patients were included in the present study mri was performed using a  tesla scanner channnel coil system skyra siemens erlangen germany a biparametric mri was used instead of a contrast mri and a unified protocol was used for all mri examinations axial coronal and sagittal tweighted images were obtained and the parameters were as follows repetition time tr  ms echo time te  ms flip angle  slice thickness  mm resolution    mm axial diffusionweighted imaging was performed and the parameters were as follows tr  ms te  ms flip angle  bvalues    smm average  resolution    mm quantitative adc maps were created on a voxelbyvoxel basis for all bvalues using the software on the scanner the images were read by two radiologists during daily clinical practice pirads category was assessed based on the second version of the pirads we used the pirads score noted in the patients medical records the adc values for pirads  lesions were calculated on an adc map by manually tracing the target lesions figure  regarding the prostate biopsy transperineal cognitive fusion targeted biopsy using a template for brachytherapy was performed two to six cores were obtained by targeted biopsy for suspicious areas and then core systematic biopsy was performed the primary endpoint of this study was cspc in targeted biopsy specimens of pirads  lesions a gleason score of    defined cspcan unpaired ttest was used to make comparisons between the two groups we identified independent predictive factors for the presence of cspc using the logistic regression model from the roc curve analysis an optimal cutoff adc value for diagnosing cspc of the tz of the prostate was determined using the cut point that is nearest to the upper lefthand corner based on this datadriven cutoff value sensitivity and specificity were assessed statistical significance was set at p   in the present study spss statistics ibm new york ny usa were used for statistical analysespatient characteristics and mri findings are shown in table  the detection rate of all pcs was   and the detection rate of cspc was   the presence of cspc was significantly associated with older age at biopsy higher prostate specific antigen psa value smaller total prostate volume smaller transition zone volume and longer greatest dimension of target lesion furthermore the mean and minimum adc values in patients diagnosed with cspc were  ms and  ms respectively these values were significantly lower than those in patients diagnosed with benign histology or clinically insignificant pc mean  ms minimum  ms table  shows the results of the univariate and multivariate analyses of the predictors for cspc univariate analyses demonstrated that age p   prostate volume p   transition zone volume p  greatest dimension of target lesion p  mean adc value p   and minimum adc value p   were significantly associated with cspc multivariate analysis demonstrated that transition zone volume odds ratio or   confidence interval ci  p   greatest dimension of target lesion or   ci  p   and minimum adc value or   ci  p   were independent predictors of cspc in patients with pirads  lesions figure  shows the roc curve of the minimum adc value for predicting cspc the area under the curve of minimum adc value was   ci  a minimum adc of  ms was the best cutoff value for predicting the presence of cspc in pirads  lesions the discriminative power between the presence and absence of cspc was as follows sensitivity  specificity twentytwo of  patients with negative targeted biopsy underwent followup mri of the  patients   had their lesions reclassified to pirads category  or less the minimum adc value of prebiopsy mri of these  patients was  ms of the five patients who still showed pirads  lesions on the followup mri three underwent subsequent biopsy two patients refused immediate biopsy and were followed up with psa one patient with a minimum adc value of  ms on followup mri was diagnosed with cspc the other two patients with minimum adc values of  ms and  ms on followup mris showed negative subsequent biopsies the present study evaluated the association between adc values of pirads  lesions in the tz of the prostate and detection of cspc although pirads  lesions are thought to be suspicious or highly suspicious lesions of cspc not all patients with pirads  lesions are necessarily diagnosed with cancer through biopsy it has been reported that the detection rate of cspc was  in pirads  lesions and  in pirads  lesions one reason for a negative biopsy in patients with pirads  lesions is falsepositivity of pirads assessment additionally the dominant factors for pirads assessment of the tz are tweighted images however tz cancers may be difficult to identify on tweighted images because the tz is often composed of variable amounts of intermixed glandular and stromal tissues thus demonstrating heterogeneous signal intensity stolk et al reported that inexperienced radiologists had a significantly higher false positive rate through pirads assessment in tz lesions than that in pz lesions in the present study the percentage of downgraded pirads classifications on followup mri after negative targeted biopsy was   these patients may have had false positive results one possible solution to reduce the false positive rate from pirads assessment is to refer to the adc value table  shows recent reports on the adc cutoff value for predicting cspc    the cutoff values of the mean adc range from  ms to  ms the study by wu et al reported that a minimum adc value of only  ms within the tumor could differentiate between a gleason score of  and  however these studies evaluated the adc cutoff values for the whole prostate without distinguishing the zonal location of the prostate it is important to make a distinction though because different optimal adc cutoff values may exist between the pz and tz this could be the case because the adc values of benign and malignant lesions in the tz have been reported to be lower than those in the pz to date no study has evaluated the association between adc values and the presence of cspc in the tz the present study is the first to demonstrate that the minimum adc value in pirads  lesions is an independent predictor for cspc in the tz and to specify that a minimum adc of  ms is the best cutoff value for predicting the presence of cspc in pirads  lesionsalthough many studies have evaluated the association between adc values and detection of prostate cancer most have focused on the mean adc value in suspicious lesions moreover studies on liver and breast tumors reported that mean and minimum adc values were valuable for differentiating between malignant and benign lesions and that the minimum adc value was more sensitive and specific than the mean adc value  these studies could confirm the validity of our results in addition the adc values were calculated on an adc map by manually tracing the target lesions in the present study  we think that minimum adc value are easier to use in daily clinical practice because minimum adc value which are the lowest adc values within target lesions may be less affected by manual tracing of target lesion compared to mean adc value regarding limitations the possibility of sampling errors in targeted biopsies must be considered the cancer detection rate by transperitoneal cognitive fusion targeted biopsy for lesions classified as pirads  or greater has been reported to be   our cancer detection rate of  for pirads category  lesions seems to be relatively low although there might be a subset of patients with false positive results in pirads assessment in the present study additionally while it has been reported that the cancer detection rate in tz lesions was lower than that in pz lesions the relatively low cancer detection rate in the present study might be caused by sampling error in targeted biopsy to date there have been three studies on followup in patients with pirads  lesions whose biopsies showed benign histology first hauth et al  followed  patients with pirads  lesions and a negative initial core biopsy the minimum adc values at baseline and followup mri in patients with pirads  lesions were  ms and  ms respectively  upon followup mri two lesions were downgraded to pirads  eight lesions remained pirads  and sixteen lesions progressed to pirads  classification the rate of malignancy in the second core biopsy of pirads  lesions was   an instant repeat biopsy for pirads  lesions with an initial negative biopsy result was recommended second ullrich et al analyzed  patients with pirads  lesions in their study the detection rate of all pcs was   and the detection rate of cspc was   however pirads  lesions in the tz with overlaying signs of stromal hyperplasia showed pc in only  of patients  cspc therefore they recommended repeat targeted biopsy for pirads  lesions in the pz and followup using mri for pirads  lesions in the tz with overlaying signs of stromal hyperplasia third meng et al analyzed  patients with pirads  lesions and nonmalignant pathological findings on initial targeted prostate biopsy of the  patients who underwent followup mri   were downgraded to pirads  or lower and   had persistent pirads  on repeat mri targeted biopsy cancer was found in  of men with pirads  therefore they recommended prompt repeat biopsy in patients who showed pirads  lesions on followup mriin the present study we demonstrated that a minimum adc of  ms was the best cutoff value for predicting the presence of cspc in pirads  lesions in the tz therefore we propose the following followup protocol when the minimum adc value on followup mri in pirads  lesions in the tz is  ms or less prompt repeat biopsy is recommended conversely when the minimum adc value is more than  ms it might be possible to substitute further followup using mri for prompt repeat biopsy   while the present study provided novel information about pirads assessment in patients with pc in the tz of the prostate it has several limitations first this study was retrospectively conducted at a single institution thus the number of cases was relatively small second there was no uniform followup protocol after a negative biopsy third the possibility of falsepositivity in the pirads assessment and sampling error in targeted biopsy cannot be ruled out because the present study analyzed data obtained during daily clinical practice several radiologists were involved in pirads assessment and multiple urologists performed cognitive fusion targeted biopsy these conditions could be associated with false positive results in pirads assessments and sampling errors in biopsies despite these limitations we believe that the findings of the present study will contribute to more appropriate followup in patients with pirads  lesions and initial negative targeted biopsy future prospective studies or analyses using whole prostatectomy specimens are warranted to validate the optimal cutoff value of the minimum adc value of pirads  lesions the present study demonstrated that the minimum adc value in pirads  lesions was associated with the presence of cspc in the tz thus the minimum adc value might be useful for followup in patients with pirads  lesions and an initial negative biopsyethical approvalthis retrospective study was conducted according to the ethical guidelines for clinical studies of the ministry of health labor and

Response to reviewer comments,ZNUKT_4.docx,Response to reviewer comments,ZNUKT_4.docx,we greatly appreciate the constructive and helpful comments of the editor and reviewer regarding our manuscript we have read them carefully and provided responses to the individual comments belowhow did you identify balanced bikes from the database are they recorded as such is it possible some cases may have been missedresponse thank you for your important comment to avoid confusion we have included more details on how to identify balance bikes from our databasewe have changed the sentence in the first paragraph of the materials and methods section from the department nurses triage database was used to identify balance bike related injuries to we identified patients for this study using the triage database utilised by our nurses a triage nurse evaluates the injury situation in all patients visiting the emergency room and records it based on these records all trauma patients are registered in the database of the hospital we extracted balance bike by employing a freetext search in this databasewith our freetext search if the triage nurse misspelled balance bike or listed as a different word we may not have identified all balance bike injuries we have added the following in the sixth paragraph of the discussion section because we used a freetext search it is possible that we did not identify all balance bike injuries if the triage nurse misspelled the words or used a different word to describe the balance bike eg training bikewe cannot rule out the possibility that the balance bike injury was misclassified as a bicycle injury however all triage nurses are aware of the differences between bicycles and balance bikes and about the age groups that most often use balance bikes thus we estimate that the possibility of misclassification is low especially in the case of severe trauma the nurse is interviewed in detail about the cause of the accident at a later date in this case the possibility of misclassification is even lowerhow did you define adult supervision parents holding the bike while child has foot off while learning to balance with feet off or being close to the bike with hands offresponse thank you for your insightful comment we defined adult supervision as an adult being near the patient and witnessing the injury we have added the following sentence to the third paragraph of the materials and methods section we defined adult supervision as an adult present in the vicinity of the patient and witnessing the injuryresponse thank you for your query regarding age the manufacturer prohibits the use of the product before  years of age none of the patients in this study were of the age for which use is prohibited regarding height the saddle position of the balance bike can be adjusted according to the height but we did not check whether it was adjusted for these cases balance bikes need to be maintained according to age and height we have thus added the following sentence to the fourth paragraph of the discussion sectionregarding poor maintenance balance bikes require saddle or handle adjustment based on ones height however no data were available on whether or not balance bikes were regularly maintainedwere any of the falls due to faulty equipment some companies have withdrawn their product due to faulty parts that come off etcthank you for your important comment as you pointed out in the us some balance bike manufacturers recalled their products due to injuries caused by faulty components in this study however there were no reports of damaged parts from parents we have added the following sentence to the fourth paragraph of the discussion sectionregarding product defects none of the parents reported of any of the components of the balance bike being broken however some companies have recalled balance bikes in the us owing to faulty handlebar joints that caused injuries in this study we did not examine the balance bikes used by patients or the manufacturers of the balance bikes at least in serious accidents the condition and the manufacturer of the balance bike should be checkedthank you for your important comment to improve adherence to the balance bike manual it is necessary to provide information to the parents of balance bike users therefore it is essential to collaborate with balance bike manufacturers or the government as a prospect the following has been added to the fifth paragraph of the discussion sectionto improve adherence to the balance bike manual providing information to users through balance bike manufacturers or consumer commissions is essential further research that includes more detailed data such as preaccident information and the condition of the balance bike that caused the accident may help manufacturers and consumer committees to alert patients of balance bike userseditorial comment please provide a description of a balance bike and a photograph of a typical examplethank you for your important suggestion unfortunately we could not have permission from any company to use the photograph of balance bikes thus we commissioned a professional illustrator to draw an illustration of a balance bike the illustrations are designed to show the features of the balance bike so we think that the readers of journal of paediatrics and child health will be able to fully understand the features of the balance bike the copyright of the illustration has been assigned to the author so we believe that no credit or permission to reproduce is necessarywe have added the figure of the illustrations of a balance bike and the following in figure legend figure  diagonal a and lateral view b of illustrations of a balance bikewe hope that we have

Research paper_Journal article,ZOOGT_5_2.docx,Research paper_Journal article,ZOOGT_5_2.docx,identification of moldy peanuts from nearinfrared hyperspectral images using multiscale pointcentered convolutional neural networkpeanuts subjected to poor storage and improper transportation conditions are prone to mildew which produces aflatoxin a potent carcinogen the object of this study mainly focuses on rapid and nondestructive identification of moldy peanuts using hyperspectral imaging and convolutional neural network cnn hyperspectral images of moldy and healthy peanuts were acquired in the  nm range to exploit the spatialspectral information contained in the hyperspectral images the paper proposed a multiscale pointcentered cnn mpcnn into which a patch including the central pixel and its surrounding pixels is considered the convolutional kernel parameters and input window size that affect the model performance were optimized then tembedded stochastic neighbour embedding tsne were used to visualize the output of each network layer finally mpcnn gave pixellevel classification map with an overall accuracy of   and  for huayu silihong and xiaobaisha peanuts respectively the results show that the mpcnn has a more promising potential for identifying moldy peanuts using hyperspectral imaging compared to conventional methods peanuts are rich in nutrients and are one of the most important oilseed crops worldwide in  total peanut production in china was  million tons accounting for  of the total world production usda  peanuts are prone to mildew and produce aflatoxin when stored or transported under suboptimal conditions in  the international cancer research agency which is part of the world health organization listed aflatoxin as a class i carcinogen which could pose a deadly threat to humans aflatoxin poisoning in eastern and central kenya caused  liver failures and  deaths in  lewis et al  therefore many countries have limited the aflatoxin content in food the main standards are as follows eu  gkg us  gkg china  gkg and brazil gkg liangbin  thin layer chromatography tlc liquid chromatography lc and highperformance liquid chromatography hplc are the primary methods used to detect aflatoxin herzallah  these methods provide accurate results but require cumbersome operations hightech instruments and do not provide realtime nondestructive test results wang et al  therefore a fast nondestructive and easytooperate method is needed to identify moldy peanuts and prevent them from entering the food chain hyperspectral imaging integrates traditional spectroscopy and imaging technology to provide hypercube data that simultaneously collect twodimensional spatial and onedimensional spectral information hyperspectral images consist of a series of images at each designated continuous band that can accurately distinguish between similar objects or materials this imaging technology is a nondestructive method that enables rapid food quality and safety evaluation wu  sun  jiang qiao and he  obtained hyperspectral images of healthy peanuts and severely moldy peanuts from  to  nm and selected key bands using principal component analysis pca these key bands were then used to classify peanuts as healthy or moldy tao et al  identified maize kernels inoculated with aflatoxigenic fungi using partial leastsquares discriminant analysis plsda based on the key bands determined by the random frog rf algorithm wan et al  used competitive adaptive reweighted sampling cars variable combination population analysis vcpa and interval variable iterative space shrinkage approach ivissa to select the key bands and myoglobin contents in nitritecured mutton was determined using then partial least squares regression plsr and least squares support vector machine lssvm these studies first selected key bands and then classifiers such as svm or plsda were used for classification recently deep learning dl including various models such as convolutional neural networks cnns deep belief networks dbns and stacked autoencoders saes has been used for hyperspectral images classification because its ability to automatically extract features dl can solve complex problems with high accuracy because it can encode lowlevel features into more discriminative highlevel features ni et al  however the dbn and sae models ignore spatial information because of flattening hyperspectral images in hyperspectral images information in adjacent pixels is related to centre pixel information these relationships decay with distance fricker et al  convolution operations follow a similar principle therefore cnn can extract the spatial features of images naturally by convolution find patterns in neighboring pixel groups and associate them with background information niu lan shao zhang  additionally cnn can automatically extract highlevel hierarchical and abstract features which are more robust for nonlinear processing fang li zhang chan  based on the mean spectrum of pacific white shrimp at  nm yu et al  combined the extracted features using saes with lssvm to predict tvbn content zhu et al  used onedimensional convolution based on pixellevel spectra to identify soybean categories and found that models using pixellevel spectra from a few soybeans showed comparable performance to models using average spectra of many soybeans yu et al  acquired hyperspectral images of hybrid okra seeds and used the mean value of all pixel spectra of each seed and a cnn model to identify the class of hybrid okra seeds han and gao  adopted a reshape image cnn to detect aflatoxin in peanuts however spatial information was not incorporatedin this study we investigated the potential of using a multiscale pointcentered cnn mpcnn to identify moldy peanuts via hyperspectral images the specific goals of this study were  to develop an mpcnn model with patch as input to identify moldy peanuts  to optimize the parameters of mpcnn  to compare the mpcnn with conventional methods  to visualize the output of each layer of the mpcnn model and  to generate the distribution maps of moldy peanuts among healthy peanutsin this study three varieties of peanuts huayu hy silhong slh and xiaobaisha xbs  were purchased from a market to simulate peanuts becoming moldy in the natural environment the peanut samples were placed in a constant temperature and humidity incubator shpb beijing hengnuolixing co ltd the optimal growth temperature for aspergillus flavus is  c and the optimal temperature for toxin production is  c passamani et al  therefore the experiment consisted of two parts spore growth and toxin production during the spore growth period peanuts were cultivated in a constant temperature and humidity incubator at  c and  relative humidity for  d then the temperature was adjusted to  c while the relative humidity remained unchanged peanuts incubated for th and th days were removed and used as shortterm moldy peanuts stmp and longterm moldy peanuts ltmp respectively healthy peanuts hp were selected as the control group the control group was stored under dry wellventilated conditions during the experiment finally  hy  slh and  xbs peanut samples were obtained as the training set and   and  samples were used as the validation set respectively all subsequent processes focused on determining whether aflatoxin in moldy peanuts stmp and ltmp exceeded the standard stmp and ltmp were regarded as moldy peanuts during data processing with stmp representing early moldy peanutsto determine whether the peanuts contained aflatoxin a portion of hp stmp and ltmp were selected for testing after hyperspectral images were collected aflatoxin b rapid detection test paper beijing puzan biotechnology co ltd with a minimum detection limit of  gkg ppb was used to measure aflatoxin in peanuts the main operation steps of aflatoxin b rapid detection test paper included sampling extraction loading and reading the result more specific descriptions of aflatoxin b rapid detection test paper can be found in yuan et al the gaiasorter pushbroom imaging spectrometer sichuan dualix spectral imaging technology co ltd was used to scan the hp stmp and ltmp the gaiasorter pushbroom imaging spectrometer has a spectral range of  nm and a spectral resolution of  nm with a total of  bands the spectral field of view of the imaging spectrometer is  with a column length of  pixels to avoid background effects on spectra measurements samples were separately placed on a black resin tray a total of  hyperspectral images of peanuts from the three peanut varieties were obtained as training samples hyperspectral images of some mixed samples of moldy and healthy peanuts  in total were used as validation samples an inkind shooting of the training and validation images is shown in figure  all peanuts were dried before hyperspectral images were collected to avoid the influence of moisture on the spectra the reference plate and dark current were measured simultaneously and hyperspectral images of moldy and healthy peanuts were collected the signal intensity detected via the original detector was calibrated to reflectivity using formula where r is the relative reflectance following hyperspectral image correction id is the dark current image iw is the white panel spectrum and is is the pixel signal intensity valuealthough hyperspectral images can simultaneously collect high spectral and spatial resolutions noise is an issue singular spectrum analysis ssa is an effective method by which instrument noise associated with the hyperspectral imaging system can be removed qiao et al  in this study ssa was used to reduce the noise associated with hyperspectral data the specific steps involved in using ssa were previously described by qiao et al to remove background effects on peanut spectra and obtain the range of individual peanut kernels nonpeanut pixels were masked to zero and region growth algorithm was used to extract the range of single peanut kernel the th band nm was used as the mask band because the spectral reflectance of the resin tray was much lower than that of peanutsin this study a pointcentered cnn pcnn was adopted which means that the input of the cnn is a patch including the central pixel and its surrounding pixels the size of the patch is  where  is the input window size and  is the number of bands when training and testing pcnn the label of the patch is equal to the label of the central pixel the surrounding pixels are used as supplementary information to determine the class of the central pixel in other words pcnn uses patch as input to predict the class of the central pixel each pixel has a corresponding patch which means that the number of peanut patches is equal to that of peanut pixels in the convolution operation an inner filter moves around the window of the patch to extract the spatial and spectral features this makes the pcnn focus on extracting spectralspatial information between the central pixel and the pixels surrounding of the input patch the advantages of pcnn are twofold the inputs of pcnn are smaller which allows a lightweight network to reduce model complexity this network is easy to train and less prone to overfitting second pcnn provides more trainable samples than imagelevel cnn furthermore for moldy peanut identification we were more concerned about the local spectralspatial changes caused by mold in this study a mpcnn was proposed as shown in figure  the mpcnn was composed of a multiscale convolution layer two convolution layers two fully connected layers and one softmax layer the first layer of multiscale convolution msc performs several convolutions a    convolution a    convolution after a    convolution and two sequential    convolutions after a    convolution then the convolution results are connected msc allows multiple features with different scales to be obtained simultaneously using multiple filters with different sizes after msc the second and third layer of convolution operations cc were performed and the obtained feature maps were expanded then the relationship between the extracted features and the corresponding label was established through the fourth and fifth fully connected layers ff finally the softmax function was used to convert the output of f into a probability score that indicated whether the central pixel of the patch was contaminated after each convolution a batch normalization bn layer and a rectified linear unit relu were used  represents the number of convolution kernels in each layer which is twice that of the previous layer to retain the information of the previous feature maps many cnn models such as imagenet use this ratio krizhevsky sutskever hinton  in addition dropout was used in the full connection layers to avoid overfitting then the output of each peanut patch was input into the optimizer finally the mpcnn was trained by the crossentropy loss cel combined with stochastic gradient descent sgd optimizer to minimize the difference between the predicted value and the label value a detailed description of the mpcnn is provided in table to verify the validity of the msc layer a network containing only c c f f and softmax was developed this network was denoted as classical pcnn the hardware configuration used in this experiment was as follows gpu nvidia geforce rtx  super cpu intel core ik and ram kingston ddr  mhz the dl models was developed in pytorch facebook ai research menlo park california usain this study commonly used feature selection and classification methods were used for comparison cars is a popular feature selection algorithm which selects the bands with the largest absolute value of the regression coefficient in the pls model using adaptive reweighted sampling technology cars removed the bands with a small weight and the lowest subset of rmsecv was selected using crossvalidation more detailed steps about cars can be found in li liang xu and cao besides spatial features were used to enhance the performance of the conventional classification model gray level cooccurrence matrix glcm is a commonly used method for texture analysis wang shan han zhao zhang  in this study the mean variance homogeneity contrast dissimilarity entropy second moment and correlation of a total of eight glcm texture variables mean variance uniformity contrast homogeneity entropy energy second moment and correlation were extracted from selected key band images sliding window of  distance of  pixel and average angles of    and  the specific formula for glcm can be found in aheto et al  the key bands selected by cars were used for texture calculation to simplify data processing and improve the predictive ability of texture variables to avoid considerable amounts of data preprocessing and potential information loss the obtained features were fused at featurelevel before further analysis then mean normalization was used to normalize the data as shown in formula where  is the original data and is the normalized value this normalization process was applied to both the training and validation setssupport vector machines svms are popular supervised machine learning methods saunders et al  the basic principle of an svm is to map the lowdimensional vectors to a highdimensional feature space establish a pair of parallel supporting hyperplanes and achieve optimal class separation of classes the svm with radial basis function was used to classify the moldy and healthy peanuts based on the key bands selected by cars and the fusion data the training set samples were divided into  for crossvalidation to determine the optimal parameters of the svmthe tdistributed stochastic neighbor embedding tsne was used to visualize the output of each feature layer of mpcnn the tsne devassy  george  is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm for visualizing highdimensional data by mapping data from highdimensional space to lowdimensional space such that similar instances are close to each other and different instances are far away from each other the tsne can simultaneously maintains the local and global structure of the data the output of each layer of mpcnn was first flattened into a vector and then the flattened vector was projected from high dimensions onto a twodimensional planethe correct classification rate ccr  was used to evaluate the performance of the established model in the training and validation sets as followswhere  is the number of correctly classified samples in the training or validation set and  is the total number of samples in the training or validation set  all the data preprocessing and analysis of conventional approaches were performed in envi  exelis visual information solutions boulder colorado usa and matlab  ra mathworks natick massachusetts usaspectral information obtained by hyperspectral imaging reflects the chemical composition and tissue structure of the sample the average reflectance spectra of hp stmp and ltmp for the three varieties peanuts were shown in figure  hp showed a significant absorption peak at approximately  nm which is mainly related to the second overtone ch stretching rao et al  the absorption peak of stmp decreased slightly while that of ltmp disappeared the overall trends of the three peanut spectral curves were very similar after  nm the absorption peaks at approximately  nm  nm  nm and  nm are in sequence with first overtone nh stretching first overtone ch stretching second overtone oh bending and second overtone ch bending phanthien golic wright lee to determine whether hp stmp and ltmp contained aflatoxin aflatoxin b rapid detection test paper was used on all three peanut varieties the minimum detection limit of the test paper was  gkg as shown in figure  the xbs test results for hp peanuts were negative indicating that the aflatoxin content did not exceed  gkg the xbs test results for stmp and ltmp were positive indicating that the aflatoxin content exceeded the  gkg all samples were analysed in duplicate the results from the hy and slh peanuts were consistent with those of xbs peanutscars was run  times and the bands with the highest frequency at each peak were selected as the key bands resulting in a total of seven key bands at       and  nm the parameters used for cars were determined by sevenfold crossvalidation giving  monte carlo sampling runs and a principal component limit of  then the glcm was used to extract texture features from the key bands finally    texture feature variables were obtained subsequently the texture features and spectral features were fused at featurelevel to develop the classification models the classification values of hp stmp and ltmp were assigned as   and  respectivelythe peanut samples were divided into training and validation sets the classification accuracies based on key bands and fusion data are shown in table  the svm model based on fusion data performed better than that based on the key bands for both the training and validation sets the superior classification result based on the fusion data may be attributed to the fact that the fusion data combined the external and internal attributes of the peanuts which better explained the changes in moldy peanuts this result showed that combining spectral and spatial information effectively improved the identification of moldy peanuts in addition for hpltmp we obtained satisfactory classification accuracy via the conventional method which is consistent with previous studies jiang et al  qi et al  however for hpstmp it was difficult to achieve satisfactory results using conventional methodsnext a reshape image cnn was developed for comparison the pixel spectra onedimensional vector were reshaped it to a reshape image twodimensional matrix as the input for cnn model here the size of the reshaped image was set as   pixels the insufficient part of the spectrum is filled by  the reshape image cnn contains two convolutional layers two pooling layers and two fully connected layers as previously described han  gao  the classification accuracy based on the reshape image cnn is presented in table  the classification accuracies of the training samples were    for hy slh and xbs additionally the classification accuracies of the hpstmp and hpltmp for the three peanut types were    and    respectively the reshape image cnnbased model outperformed the model based on key bands and was close to the model based on fused spectra and textures this result likely occurred because the reshape image cnn ignored spatial information while automatically extracting deeplevel featuresas shown in figure  peanut patch was input to the mpcnn to determine whether the central pixel was moldy there were  peanut patches in the training set and  and  peanut patches in the validation set for hpstmp and hpltmp respectively the window size of the peanut patch was empirically chosen to be  the batch size was set to  the learning rate was  and the learning decay rate was  the low learning rate in this study was due to the small input data set the number of convolution kernels determines the resolution of the network more convolution kernels mean a stronger network but may lead to overfitting in this study n was chosen empirically from  first the mpcnn was trained using the training set and the loss variation in the epochs for mpcnn with different n is shown in figure  as the convolution kernel increased the loss of the network also decreased the losses of the mpcnn with input window sizes of  and  were close which indicated that too many convolutional kernels had little improvement on the network and increased the complexity of the networkafter the training set was used to complete the training of mpcnn the validation data was used to test the trained model figure  shows the classification accuracy of the mpcnn with different n in the hpstmp and hpltmp as n increased the classification accuracy of the model gradually increased however when n increased to  the classification accuracy of the model decreased which may be due to the fact that too many parameters made the model difficult to train thus leading to overfitting therefore n was set to  the classification accuracy based on the mpcnn is presented in table  the mpcnn showed commonality between the training and validation sets the classification accuracy of the training samples of hy slh and xbs were    while the that of the validation set of hpstmp and hpstmp for the three peanut types were    and    respectively this result indicates that the mpcnn can be used to identify moldy peanutsto verify the validity of the msc layer a classical pcnn containing c c f f and softmax was developed for comparison the number of convolutional kernels per layer of the classical pcnn was the same as that of the mpcnn the classification accuracy based on the classical pcnn is presented in table  the classification accuracies of the training samples were   and  for hy slh and xbs peanuts respectively and those of hpstmp and hpltmp for the three peanut varieties were      and  respectively figure  shows a comparison of the mpcnn and the classical pcnn in terms of validation classification accuracy and model size the classification accuracy of mpcnn was improved by approximately  and the model parameters were reduced by approximately  with the addition of msc this was due to redundancy and covariance among the original hyperspectral bands by adding an msc with a few convolution kernels the hyperspectral image redundancy was effectively compressed thus deeper features were extracted and the model performance was improved while the model complexity was reduced this suggests that adding an msc layer containing a few convolution kernels after inputting the original hyperspectral images effectively improved the performance of the networkthe input window size determines the range of the patch that can be viewed when the network is trained or used for validation when the input window size changed the feature extraction by the network also changed which means that the spatialspectral features extracted by the mpcnn were enlarged or reduced thus spatialspectral feature extraction of moldy peanuts will be altered by changing the input window size according to the number of pixels in the transverse and longitudinal directions of a peanut the input window size  was chosen empirically from   and figure  shows the accuracy of the mpcnn with different input window sizes the mpcnn model with a  input window performed better than models with  or  input windows this is because an appropriate increase in input window size means that more local similarities are considered which is helpful for improving the classification performance however an input window size that is too large may introduce additional noise which is unrelated to classification leading to reduced accuracy for a single peanut the number of pixels in the horizontal and vertical directions was approximately  the mpcnn model with a  input window sufficiently reflected the changes in local spectralspatial information details caused by mildew therefore the optimal input window size used in this study was  there are two separate steps in traditional pattern recognition first the manual features are calculated from the original data second the acquired features are used to train the classifiers currently most scholars adopt this approach yuan et al  unlike traditional methods there is no feature selection or extraction in dl dl takes the original spectral data as the input and automatically extracts features from the low level to the high level according to the structure of the network to realize the endtoend recognition of moldy peanuts thus the complex manual feature design is avoided as shown in table  the identification results of the traditional methods and cnn models performed well the classification accuracy based on fusion data was better than that using only spectral information introducing spatial information improved the identification accuracy of moldy peanuts although the model based on fusion data achieved good results in the training set it was not ideal in the validation set this may be because the fixed space filter adopted by the glcm made it difficult to describe the complex spatial changes caused by mildew in addition the traditional spatial and spectral features were extracted separately that is the spectral feature was extracted and then the spatial features are calculated thus the spatialspectral joint features could not be fully utilized which affected the classification performance the cnn automatically learned more abstract features of moldy peanuts using error backpropagation the reshape image cnn extracted deep features but failed to utilize spatial information because the spectrum were reshaped into singleband images the pcnn used the spectral information and spatial information near the central pixel to predict the central pixel which helped to reduce intraclass variance thus improving the classification performance compared with the classical pcnn the mpcnn improved the performance of the network by adding an msc with a small number of convolutional kernels in the first layer while reducing the network parameters this is because of the existence of redundancy and collinearity among the hyperspectral bands the  convolution in msc allowed effective compression of the original hyperspectral image and the multiscale structure automatically selected the optimal convolution kernel size thus improving the performance of the model table  provides a comparison of the different models in terms of training and testing time where the dlbased model was iterated  times the training times of the models based on key bandssvm and fusion datasvm were  s and  s respectively demonstrating that the traditional methods require more time to deal with large amounts of highdimensional data the training times based on the reshape cnn classical pcnn and mpcnn were   and  s respectively although the training times are close to those of the conventional methods the time required for testing was significantly lower owing to the architecture of gpus for multicore parallel calculationsin general the mpcnn model is useful for identifying moldy peanuts our results show that the mpcnn which is a new method of agricultural product detection is more effective than conventional methods thus dl has great potential as a feature extraction and classification method for hyperspectral image classificationthe tsne was used to visualize the processes of feature extraction and classification of mpcnn the complexity of the tsne algorithm is configured based on the number of features output by each layer of the mpcnn the maximum number of iterations was set to  as shown in figure  the original data and the output of msc c c f and f were projected onto a twodimensional plane using tsne as shown in figure  a owing to the influence of the light source and sample geometry the original spectra of moldy peanuts and healthy peanuts had a high overlap it was difficult to distinguish moldy peanuts from healthy peanuts based on the original data figure  b shows the visualization results of the output feature map after msc compared with the original data the distance between the moldy and healthy peanuts increased but there was still no clear boundary between the classes figure  c d e and f show the feature maps after c c f and f respectively after the feature extraction of the c and c the distance between the moldy and healthy peanuts further increased but there was still a mixed portion then by feature extraction of two pairs of the f and f the features of the same class were grouped and the feature boundaries of healthy and moldy peanuts were clearly seen in figure  f at this point the classification task could be completed using the conventional softmax layerthe trained mpcnn model was applied to whole hyperspectral images of peanuts the pixelwise classification map of moldy and healthy peanuts is shown in figure  for the classification map we were concerned with whether a peanut was moldy that is whether the peanut should be regarded as moldy and then sorted and eliminated in this study contamination of a kernel was determined based on the ratio of the number of pixels contaminated by fungi to the total number of pixels jiang et al  if the ratio was higher than a certain threshold  the peanut was contaminated otherwise the peanut was healthy ideally the threshold should be as small as possible because it is desirable to discard contaminated kernels rather than accept them therefore the threshold  in this study was set to  the kernelscale classification map is shown in figure  for the three peanut types misclassified peanuts are marked in yellow and the corresponding classification accuracies are listed in table  based on the mpcnn the moldy peanuts were effectively identifiedin this paper a pixellevel mpcnn framework is proposed to identify moldy peanuts via hyperspectral images the patch containing the central pixel and the surrounding pixels was used as the input of the neural network to obtain spectralspatial information the features extracted from each layer of the mpcnn were visualized using tsne which indicated that the extracted hierarchical features were more effective and had better distinguishability than shallow features compared with the classification model based on key bands and fusion data the accuracy of the mpcnn on hpstmp was improved by approximately  and  respectively the mpcnn gave better performance and realized the endtoend identification of moldy peanuts while avoiding the handcraft features design by comparing different input window sizes the mpcnn with  input window size was found to be more suitable for moldy peanut identification with the ability to extract local features and fine spectralspatial representation in addition the addition of msc improved the performance of the model while reducing the trainable parameters hyperspectral images coupled with the mpcnn have important potential for identifying moldy peanuts with high accuracy because it can extract more abstract spectralspatial features at a higher level which are usually robust and invariant in future work additional numbers and varieties of peanut samples should be considered to achieve a more robust classification modelthe authors thank the sichuan dualix spectral imaging technology co

Research paper_Journal article,ZUASH_24.docx,Research paper_Journal article,ZUASH_24.docx,microhabitat preferences of myxomycetes on decaying logs at subalpine coniferous forest central japanabstract most species of myxomycetes grow on decaying logs related to decay states however the ecological aspect for decay state such as wood acidity and decay types have been a little understood in this study wood hardness acidity ph and decay type which myxomycete fruiting bodies occurred at part of logs were assessed in order to reveal whether the species prefer for specific decay state of wood to obtain data seasonal surveys in summer and autumn covering two years were intensively performed at subalpine coniferous forests in central japan as a result  taxa in  genera were identified from  colonies of fruiting bodies then the species distributed at a peak of moderately decayed wood brown rot decayed wood softer  mm depth with acidic ph  in average than that white rot  mm depth with ph white rot was preferred by richer species than brown rot lanproderma columbinum preferred white rot wood with ph while cribraria macrocapa and crivraria pyriformis var notabilis preferred brown rot wood with ph and ph respectively myxomycete species were seasonally separated using decayed wood along substrate ph of which temporal and spatial variation promote species diversify of myxomycetes on decaying logsmyxomycetes are protistan amoebas of which life cycle includes the reproductive stage to produce particular sporangia holding spores like as small fungi stephenson and rojas  their habitats are mainly various plant debris in decay progressing and moisture are available they have a relation for decaying dead wood takahashi and hada  xavier de lima and andrade  and the amoeba cells and plasmodium of myxomycetes in the vegetative propagation stage in the life cycle secrete an enzyme breaking down carbohydrates outside a body mubarak and kalyanasundaram  fukasawa et al   thus they prey on decomposers such as bacteria or fungi and get organic matters as nutrient resources madelin  wood inhabiting myxomycetes lignicolous myxomycetes may have important function as regulate recycling progress of woody debris xavier de lima and andrade  and carbon accumulation in forest ecosystem ecological investigations of macroscopic myxomycetes have promoted quantitatively forward by recording abundance as the appearance of the colonies based on the frequent field survey stephenson and rojas  corse woody debris furnish many myxomycetes in various decaying states and abundantly occurred on moderately decayed wood takahashi k  hada y  takahashi and harakon  and the distribution pattern of myxomycetes associated with decay state of coarse woody debris has revealed on coniferous trees takahashi  and on broadleaf evergreen trees harakon and takahashi  in forests however these distribution patterns a little account for apparent preferences for microenvironment and interspecific interactions on decay wood in recent years there has been studied on the influence of microhabitat parameters for wood inhabiting myxomycetes including substrate varieties on the abundance occurrence and species composition of the communities in a separate local biota xavier de lima et al  vlasenko et al  harakon  takahashi it has been revealed that several myxomycetes inhabiting on living tree bark grow affecting bark ph and prefer acidic conditions everhart et al  takahashi  but it is less revealed whether lignicolous wood inhabiting myxomycetes is affected from ph of decay wood the response to ph of wood is well suggested xavier de lima  cavalcanti  and it is reported that enthusiast species of cribraria genus characteristically prefer acidic environment of decay wood it was noted that there were acidophilic species in the genera comatricha and cribraria vlasenko et al  but the most of species are not apparent on preference for ph of decay wood materials it was suggested that ph changes of woody materials when decaying wood advances and decay types affect the growth of myxomycetes fukasawa et al subalpine coniferous forests in central japan have been conserved in national park and maintain the natural ecosystem of forests and the fallen dead trees exists with a lot of variously decayed wood in the forests many species of myxomycetes appear forming fruit bodies on fallen dead wood in the forest in summer and autumn takahashi and harakon  the decay stage of wood consequently progressed in decaying and include varied decaying state such as white rot and brown rot present study intended how myxomycetes respond for state of decayed wood such as decay types and ph of wood as for the role of myxomycetes play an important role in the decomposing process of coarse woody debris in the forest ecosystem enthusiast characteristics of myxomycete morphospecies for decay state of wood focused on clarifying the preference for ph and decaying types study sites were selected at two sites in coniferous forests of subalpine located in nagano prefecture in central japan maine site was a conserved natural forest near shirakomaike  m altitude sakuhomachi minamisakugun n  e and another site was also a conserved natural forest near kitazawatouge  m asl inashi hasekurogouchi n e these forests were old growth forests that were dominated by the conifers abies veitchii lindley abies mariesii mast and tsuga diversifolia mast and contained a rich supply of large deadwood logs with varied decay states in the forest floor fig a the climate in the study sites was cool and humid with high rainfall in summer junejuly and autumn septemberoctober at the neighboring japanese meteorological agency station haramura n e  m asl the coldest month mean temperature c on january the warmest month mean temperature c on august and the mean annual temperature c and precipitation were  mm  respectively based on a standard temperature lapse rate of cm meteorological society of japan  the temperature at the shirakomaike subalpine site was predicted the mean annual temperature c precipitation was expected to increase and snow expected to be present for approximately  months per year similar in kitazawatouge field surveys conducted as similar as previous investigation which demonstrated abundant occurrences of myxomycetes at summer and autumn on dead wood in subalpine coniferous forest takahashi and harakon  thus the fruiting bodies were searched on over hundred logs or more in forest floor and decay types of wood were classified according to basis of the macroscopic features araya  although sporangium of myxomycetes is so ephemeral and minute that it is difficult to find out in the field we can recognize the existence of colony of fruiting bodies forming size of mm  cm range of area by a careful search with the naked eye and observation using magnifying glass the surveys were planned two field years and performed in summer  july  and  july  at kitazawatouge  july  and  july  at shirakomaike and in autumn  october   october  at shirakomaike site those surveys were carried out by walking a census route that was approximately  m wide and  m long along path in all surveys sampling was continued intensively in one site until more than  samples of which survey effort spent around  hours at one time each a colony which occurred at each separated locations on decaying logs recognized a sample ie sampling a colony of fruiting bodies that was considered to have emerged from the same plasmodium was recorded as one sample following the methods used in previous studies eliasson  stephenson  logs of fallen dead trees of the dominant tree species of the forest had diameters  cm and lengths  m over were assessed common recognizable myxomycete fruiting bodies were identified to the level of species in the field using a magnifying glass difficult specimens were collected and glued to a paper in a specimen box and examined under a microscope in the laboratory abundance of myxomycete species was combined with distinctive survey seasons as data sets the nomenclature followed that of yamamoto  whereas scientific names referred to the most recent literature httpeumycetozoacom edited by lado  voucher specimens were deposited in the tottori museum herbarium myxomycete species tend to occur according to the state of wood decay takahashi and hada  takahashi  and to inhabit on moderately humid part of logs on varied decay states takahashi and hada  as for wood moistures were influenced by weather effects so present study avoided measurement of moisture of wood we focused on assay the substrate hardness of the deadwood the hardness mm depth of the part of a log on which fruiting bodies emerged was measured using a soil hardness tester no  fujiwara scientific and also measured ph of wood part which fruiting bodies emerged with a handheld ph meter for check of soil acidity fig b shinwa code  measurement range of  with one scale of ph of which method followed previous study fukasawa et al   we assessed observed species richness varieties were regarded as species by comparing it with estimated species richness which was calculated from observed records using the computer application past hammer et al  httpfolkuionoohammerpast this program was chosen because of its use in previous studies eg takahashi and hada  the index of  diversity was calculated on the assemblages between the respective seasons and decay types the  diversity of myxomycete assemblages were compared using dissimilarity distance between two assemblages in a criterion similarity of braycurtis bray and curtis  which was shown range of    distribution patterns of myxomycete species from wood hardness grade step of  mm depth from  mm depth to  mm depth and substrate ph grade step of  from  to  were classified in around ten steps at every season wood hardness and substrate ph were calculated average corresponding to each species following previous study stephenson  the species composition of myxomycete assemblage was indicated by score of relative abundance of species number of colonies given a species  total colonies x   the hardness and substrate ph of wood calculated mean for each species and the ph demanded a range of min  max value the enthusiast preference of species for rot types extracted using the independency test performed with soft wear of esumi excel statistics  esumi co ltd tokyo japanthe hardness of the substrates which the fruit bodies occurred was    mm depth n   with mean and standard deviation in summer and was    mm n   in autumn table  myxomycete seasonally occurred on various decay states and hardness of the substrates were no significant differences between them p   ph of wood ranged of  was distributed by varied species the means of wood ph which the fruit bodies occurred were significantly higher in autumn ph   than in summer ph   p   table the ph little correlated to wood hardness with coefficient of correlation r   p   decay types which fruiting bodies emerged on influenced wood hardness and ph both of which were significantly different between whit rot and brown rot p   white rot was hardness of mm and ph  and brown rot was hardness of mm and ph  the brown rot substrate progressed softer on decay state and stronger acidityfruiting bodies of myxomycetes that had formed a colony in size from ca mm to a few cm fig c d a summer survey reached more abundant observation of hundred or more colonies of myxomycetes but an autumn survey approximately reached fifty colonies at last that was less occurrence of fruiting bodies logs were frequently covered by epiphyte such as bryophytes or lichens on apical and upper side of logs myxomycetes mostly appeared on side to lower side of logs or surface with no epiphytes whereas fruiting bodies like lamproderma columbimum occasionally inhabited with bryophytes   we have found  taxa belonging to  genus altogether thirtyfour taxa of  genus confirmed from the observation of  samples of fruit bodies in summer table  and  taxa of  genus from  samples confirmed in autumn table  the both assemblages were so dissimilar that  diversity was  of bray curtis index between summer and autumn only four taxa lycogala epidemdrum trichia botrytis trichia decipiens and cribraria filiformis were common between both assemblages in summer there were seven taxa popularly occurred having  samples or more table  that were ceratiomyxa fruticulose lycogala epidemdrum stemonitis axifera cribraria cancellate stemonitopsisi hyperopta physarum viride and stemonitopsis aequalis in order then the seven taxa frequently appeared at four or more following accompanying species which appeared less than four samples was  taxa in the followingin autumn there were seven taxa generally occurred having  or more samples of which taxa biased assemblage lamproderma collumbinum and cribraria macrocarpa were prominant with relative abundance of  respectively following lycogala epidemdrumtrichia decipiens elaeomyxo cerifera trichia erecta and tubifera ferruginosa in order table  then accompanying species which appeared less than four samples was nine taxa in the following  as occurrences for decay types of myxomycetes white rot had eminent occurrences of fruiting bodies which accounted for  n   of whole samples and consisted of  taxa while brown rot accounted for  samples n   consisted of  taxa table  fifteen taxa commonly appeared both decay types table  and the  diversity between decay types was indicated by bc index of many species appeared on moderately decay state peaking for decay stage which was of  mm depth and  mm depth at  taxa in summer and of  mm depth and  mm depth at seven taxa in autumn fig  moderately decayed wood indicated with wood hardness grade of  mm depth which distributed over ten taxa of myxomycetes in each grade fig furnished reached  taxa  of all taxa however three taxa physarum newtonii stemonitis favogenita and stemonitis smithii limited on hard wood with  mm depth or more which was less decayed wood and five taxa conversely limited on already well decayed wood less than  mm depth cribraria intricate cribraria purpurea cribraria vulgaris cribraria vulgaris var oregana and lindbladia tubulinathe distribution pattern of ph grades indicated peak at grade of ph  of which grade caused  taxa in summer and at grade of ph  caused  taxa in autumn fig  twenty taxa that appeared on four samples or more examined enthusiast characteristics for wood environment of hardness and ph table  the species distribution on decay states was analyzed by mean of the hardness and ph and showed in scatter diagram figure  these species intensively distributed on moderate decay substrates hardness  mmmm depth but the partial distribution was seen several species to the substrate ph respective species was ranged for around ph   ph  however the autumnal species was distributed higher ph than ph  different from the summer species which distributed less than ph lycogala epidendrum lyep which appeared common to both seasons inhabited on hardness  mm depth with ph  in summer whereas mm depth with ph  in autumn among  species with abundance of four or more only one taxa preferred white rot lamproderma columbinum independent test p  while two taxa such as cribraria macrocarpa and c pyriformis var notabilis significantly preferred brown rot independent test p   these species were typically appeared and preferred respective decay type of which substrate ph were was ph  ph  and ph respectively table  decay types affected only a few taxa and species of cribraria particularly preferred brown rot with acidic substratethe forest floor in subalpine coniferous forest fig a was abundant bryophytes which were sometimes covered fallen logs fruiting bodies of lamproderma columbinum frequently occurred on logs with bryophytes fig c which suggested coincidental existence and interaction with myxomycetes it was investigated whether bryophytes serve as the primary substrate for fruiting sporangia as coincidence or preference stephenson and studlar  duka and romanenko  although thallus of bryophytes obviously provided exposed surfaces convenient for myxomycete sporulation and two species were evidently recognized as bryophilous barbeyella minutissima and lepidoderma tigrinum in temperate north american forest l columbinum is not known as coincidental species on rotten coniferous logs stephenson and studlar  thus relation between myxomycetes and bryophytes on woody substrate were only spatial rather than trophic in present study in the present survey subalpine coniferous forest takahashi harakon  have reported myxomycetes of  taxawithvarietiestreatedasspeciesbelonging genusfrom  records on logs it is suggested succession on myxomycete community takahashi  when approximately ten years have passed decaying of wood influenced structure of myxomycete assemblage present records were of fortysix taxa belonging  genus from  records the previous study constituted dominant species in the community of which relative abundances were in order of ceratiomyxo fruticulosa  physarum viride  stemonitis axifera  lycogala epidendrum  in summer and in order of lamproderma columbinum  cribraria macrocarpa  trichia decipiens  in autumn change over time made community structure recompose in relative abundances ie ceratiomyxo fruticulosa  lycogala epidendrum  stemonitis axifera  and physarum viride  in summer and lamproderma columbinum  cribraria macrocarpa  and trichia decipiens  in autumn thus progress of wood decaying particularly affected increasing of l epidendrum l columbinum and c macrocarpa decreasing of p viride and t decipiens the inhabitation of myxomycete species on decaying logs was influenced by association with progress of decay dynamics of wood the decay process of logs is caused by primitive function of fungi and bacteria and is crucial for biodiversity in forest ecosystem clausen  fukasawa et al  in addition myxomycetes also affects the decaying wood fukasawa et al  myxomycetes have foraging association with fungal communities on coarse woody debris fukasawa et al  the decay process involves two phases in the first phase suggestive of the white rot and the second phase suggestive of the brown rot fukasawa et al  subsequently nutrients mineralize firstly but immobilize in second phase the difference of decay types affects the difference of the physicochemical property of the substrate and cause various biocoenoses which live and use decay wood as a habitat and bait resources fukasawa  as for wood decaying progress of white rot have positive correlation with substrate ph while brown rot progressing is accompanied with acidification of substrate ph fukasawa et al  caused by that the brown rot fungi product oxalic acid with degradation of wood decay espejo and agosin  in present coniferous forest the wood of brown rot was softer and lower ph than that of white rot table  white rot was prevalent in the present forest as similar as previous study on decomposition of pine logs in geographical distribution in japan fukasawa  and furnished richer species of myxomycetes than brown rot the property of the brown rot made specialist species habit for the acidic environment  in this study most species distributed on both decay types and white rot was preferred by richer species than on brown rot preference for decay types significantly revealed in two species in autumn lamproderma clumbinum typically occurred fruiting bodies on white rot with  mm depth and ph while cribraria macrocapa occurred on wood of  mm depth and ph and preferentially on brown rot furthermore c pyriformis var notabilis preferred brown rot wood with mm depth and ph in summer those three species performed choice for environment of decay state evidently reveled decay type and ph thus they grew on particular microenvironments created by decay type as an important factor for inhabitation wood decay types affected chemical property of the substrate and myxomycete inhabitation conducted for decay state of which cause influence for bacterial activity jurgensen et al  clausen  various interactions in the biocoenoses are presumed because myxomycetes feed on bacteria and there is the fact that most bacteria do not grow well under acidic conditions lauber et al  the influence of substrate acidity on myxomycete distribution was investigated on several different substrate such as small dead twigs of a tree canopy schnittler et al  living tree bark everhart et al  lianas bark wrigley de basanta et al  and reproductive structures of vascular plants kilgore et al  and litters in forest floor rojas and stephenson  in high elevation oakforest of costa rica substrate ph examining dead leaves decaying wood and twigs for myxomycetes reported in order of cribraria vulgaris ph  with a mean value cribraria piriformis ph  lamprodema columbinum ph  trichia botrytis ph  ceratiomyxa fruticulosa ph lycogala epidendrum ph  in mean values rojas and stephenson  on decay wood it is known that three species of ceratiomyxa inhabit distinctive ph of substrate ie ceratiomyxa fruticulosa preferencially occur on substrate of ph in average but the other two species c morchella and c sphaerosperma particularly prefer different substrate of ph and ph respectively in the neotropics rojas et al  xavier de lima and andrade  reported that species of cribraria such as cribraria cancellata ph  with a mean value c tenella ph  and the other species arcyria cinerea ph  lycogala epidendrum ph stemonitis axifera ph and ceratiomyxa fluticulosa ph fukasawa et al  also reported that two species of cribraria c tenella and c intricata prefer acidic wood of lower ph but ceratiomyxa fruticulose prefer nearneutral ph in addition there is the report that species of cribraria and comatricha prefer acid substrate on decaying wood vlasenko et al  those studies indicate myxomycete species have strong preferences for substate ph on decaying wood of which reason are supported by following several evidence the influences of ph for myxomycetes were on zygote formation shinnick et al  plasmodium formation collins and tang  and sporulation gray   of certain species of myxomycete it has been known that cribraria occur preferentially in acidic environments schnittler et al  rojas and stephenson  everhart et al  whereas it remains unclear why cribraria species prefer acidic conditions present study revealed two species of cribraria particularly preferred brown rot with lower ph ie cribraria pyriformis var notabilis on well decayed with ph in summer and cribraria macrocarpa habitat on welldecayed wood with ph  in autumn it extended explains in more detail available species of cribraria prefer acid microenvironment caused by brown rot and seasonally separate usage substrate the characteristics of substrate use vary in a peak which was temporally separated by ph preference of species fig  microhabitat usage on decaying wood seasonally divided into two groups fig  that is mainly below ph in summer and over ph in autumn it is suggested that seasonal and spatial usage for wood decaying and ph diversify myxomycete species on coarse woody debris in forests climatic biome in locality creates substrate difference for myxomycetes and provides distinctive substrate traits derived from varied decay states and types substrate ph was important environmental parameter for myxomycete inhabitation schnittler et al  stephenson et al  and the low appears to be a limiting factor for growth and development of most species of myxomycetes which may simply result from the fact that most bacteria do not grow well under these conditions lauber et al  as shown in this study myxomycetes probably use bait resources associating with seasonal different supply of bacteria and residues in decaying wood myxomycetes may function and control wood decay progression as scavenger for decomposer of bacteria and fungi therefore myxomycetes may be applied for deterioration defense of the useful wood in forestry  yoshida and more study is expected for elucidation of ecological aspect of myxomycete function they play an important role in recycle of material and carbon accumulation of coarse woody debris in forest ecosystemsfallen logs in forest floor provided varied microhabitat for biocoenoses of which organisms were interact in recycling processes of materials of forest ecosystem decay process of woody debris has function for regeneration of forest trees myxomycetes play a role in decaying processes of woody substrate as well as decomposer of fungi and bacteria on decaying logs myxomycetes inhabitation was affected by decay types and decay state such as wood hardness and ph
